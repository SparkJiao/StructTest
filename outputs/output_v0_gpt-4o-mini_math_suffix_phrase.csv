0,"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling duck eggs, we first need to calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.

1. **Total eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs.
2. **Eggs eaten for breakfast**: Janet eats 3 eggs.
3. **Eggs used for baking muffins**: Janet uses 4 eggs for baking.

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs that Janet consumes or uses:

\[
\text{Total eggs consumed} = \text{Eggs eaten} + \text{Eggs used for baking} = 3 + 4 = 7
\]

Next, we find out how many eggs are left for sale:

\[
\text{Eggs left for sale} = \text{Total eggs laid} - \text{Total eggs consumed} = 16 - 7 = 9
\]

Now, we know that Janet sells these remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, we can calculate her daily earnings from selling the eggs:

\[
\text{Daily earnings} = \text{Eggs left for sale} \times \text{Price per egg} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Thus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also requires half that amount of white fiber. Since half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt, the robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we can calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the bolts of blue and white fiber together:

Total bolts = bolts of blue fiber + bolts of white fiber
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe is \boxed{3}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
2,"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total investment**: This includes the purchase price of the house and the cost of repairs.
   - Purchase price: $80,000
   - Repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment = Purchase price + Repairs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house**: The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first need to calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   - Original value of the house = $80,000
   - Increase in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house = Original value + Increase in value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. **Calculate the profit**: Profit is calculated as the new value of the house minus the total investment.
   - Profit = New value - Total investment = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

4,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for her flock of 20 chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

\[
\text{Total feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to account for the feed that Wendi has already given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, she gives:

\[
15 \text{ cups}
\]

In the afternoon, she gives:

\[
25 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of feed given so far:

\[
\text{Total feed given} = 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given from the total daily feed requirement:

\[
\text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total feed} - \text{Total feed given} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups}

5,"To calculate the total cost for Kylar's 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

1. **Cost of the first glass**: $5
2. **Cost of every second glass**: 60% of $5 = 0.6 * 5 = $3

Now, we can pair the glasses:
- For every pair of glasses (1st and 2nd), the cost is:
  - 1st glass: $5
  - 2nd glass: $3
  - Total for one pair = $5 + $3 = $8

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine how many pairs he will have:
- Number of pairs = 16 glasses / 2 glasses per pair = 8 pairs

Now, we can calculate the total cost for all 8 pairs:
- Total cost = 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64

Thus, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for the 16 glasses is:

1. **First Leg of the Journey (to the destination)**:
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Turning Around**:
   - After reaching his destination, he turns around to go back home.

3. **Second Leg of the Journey (returning home)**:
   - John has a total of 4 hours to return home, but he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. During this time, he does not cover any distance.
   - After 2 hours of standstill traffic, he has 2 hours left to drive.

4. **Driving at 30 mph**:
   - For the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

5. **Driving at 80 mph**:
   - After driving for 0.5 hours, he has 1.5 hours left (2 hours total - 0.5 hours).

2. **Second Month**: The number of downloads was three times the downloads in the first month. 
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month**: The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}

3. **Annual Costs**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Annual Profit**: The annual profit can be calculated by subtracting the annual costs from the annual revenue:
   \[
   \text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Costs} = 10.5 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90 with the annual profit of $7.5, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7.5 \text{ dollars/year} \times n \text{ years} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{90 \text{ dollars}}{7.5 \text{ dollars/year}} = 12 \text{ years}

19,"To find out what speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time she wants to take for the entire hike**:
   - The average speed desired is 4 miles per hour.
   - The total distance of the hike is 12 miles.
   - Therefore, the total time \( T \) she wants to take is:
     \[
     T = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time she has already spent hiking**:
   - Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
   - Then she took another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
   - Thus, the total time spent so far is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining time she has to complete the hike**:
   - Since she wants to complete the hike in 3 hours and has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time \( T_r \) is:
     \[
     T_r = T - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance she needs to hike**:
   - She has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles), so the remaining distance \( D_r \) is:
     \[
     D_r = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the speed she needs to maintain for the remaining distance**:
   - To find the required speed \( S \) for the remaining distance, we use the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{D_r}{T_r} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters and is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters and is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before spilling:**
   - Total water before spilling = water in orange drink + water in pineapple drink
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 \)
   - To add these, convert 9 to a fraction with a denominator of 3: \( 9 = \frac{27}{3} \).
   - Total water = \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of orange drink remaining after spilling:**
   - Initially, there are 10 liters of orange drink, and 1 liter is spilled.
   - Remaining orange drink = \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters.

5. **Calculate the amount of water in the remaining orange drink:**
   - The remaining orange drink is still two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the remaining orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

6. **Calculate the total amount of water in the final mixture:**
   - The total amount of water in the final mixture consists of the water from the remaining orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink.
   - Total water in the final mixture = water in remaining orange drink + water in pineapple drink
   - Total water = \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

2. The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs:
   - Number of DVDs sold = 2 customers × 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

3. The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs:
   - Number of DVDs sold = 3 customers × 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs

Now, we can add the total number of DVDs sold from each group:
- Total DVDs sold = 3 DVDs (from the first group) + 4 DVDs (from the second group) + 0 DVDs (from the last group)
- Total DVDs sold = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}

   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs × $16.50/pair = $49.50.

2. **Cost of pants**:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - The cost of one pair of pants is $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs × $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes**:
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - The cost of one pair of shoes is $42.00.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs × $42.00/pair = $126.00.

Now, we sum the total costs of all clothing items:

2. **Second Stop**: The trip is 60 miles long, and he stopped 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance to the second stop can be calculated as follows:
   - Total distance of the trip: 60 miles
   - Distance from the end to the second stop: 15 miles
   - Distance to the second stop = Total distance - Distance from the end = 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles.

Now we know:
- First stop is at 20 miles.
- Second stop is at 45 miles.

To find the distance traveled between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:

Distance between first and second stops = Distance at second stop - Distance at first stop
= 45 miles - 20 miles

   Therefore, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we calculate:

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:

   - According to the problem, skipping is half as fast as running. Therefore, if we let \( R \) be Dana's running speed, we have:
     \[
     \frac{R}{2} = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed**:
   - The problem states that Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk. Let \( W \) be her walking speed. Then:
     \[
     R = 4W \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 = 4W \quad \Rightarrow \quad W = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking**:
   - Dana spends a total of 6 hours traveling. According to the problem, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking**:
   - Distance traveled while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance traveled while walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance traveled:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}

   Suzy's iPhone is given as 1 year old.

2. **Calculate Ben's iPhone age**: 
   The problem states that Ben's iPhone is ""two times older"" than Suzy's iPhone. This phrase can be interpreted as Ben's iPhone being twice the age of Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, if Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone would be:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Calculate Brandon's iPhone age**: 
   The problem states that Brandon's iPhone is ""four times as old"" as Ben's iPhone. Since we found that Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}

When not holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone is:

Distance with gemstone = 3 × 400 feet = 1200 feet.

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon, we subtract the reach of the dragon's flames from the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone:

Distance outside the flames = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's flame reach
Distance outside the flames = 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

Now, we need to determine how many servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. To find this, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories remaining / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

Now, we need to find out how many grams this corresponds to. Since the bag of chips has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, we can calculate the weight of one serving:

300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams per serving.

Now, we can find out how many grams correspond to 0.8 servings:

0.8 servings * 60 grams per serving = 48 grams.

1. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. If he sells 20 candles, his total revenue (TR) can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   TR = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Costs:**
   Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax. To make 20 candles, he needs:
   \[
   \text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}

   Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

2. **Articles written on Tuesday**: 
   She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. 
   To calculate this, we first find \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
   \[
   5 + 2 = 7
   \]

3. **Articles written on Wednesday**: 
   On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:

2. **Post-it Notes Used**: At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

Now, we can set up the equation to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased.

Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

The total number of Post-it notes after purchasing the package and before using any is:

According to the problem, this amount equals 23:
\[
(80 + x) - 220 = 23

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
80 + x - 220 = 23

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. 
   To find the number of blue ties, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per blue tie:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, the number of red ties is:
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of blue ties:**
   We already know that John spent $200 on blue ties.

4. **Determine the cost of red ties:**
   The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60

1. **Base Pension**: Marcy's base pension after 40 years of service is $50,000 per year.

2. **Entitlement to Additional Percentage**: After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond the 20-year mark.

3. **Years of Service**: Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she has worked for 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

4. **Calculation of Additional Percentage**: 
   - The additional percentage she earns is 5% for each of the 10 years after the 20-year mark.
   - Therefore, the total additional percentage is:
     \[
     10 \text{ years} \times 5\% = 50\%
     \]

5. **Total Pension Calculation**: 
   - The total pension she will receive after quitting at 30 years is the base pension plus the additional percentage:
     \[
     \text{Total Pension} = \text{Base Pension} + (\text{Base Pension} \times \text{Additional Percentage})

1. **Grace's weight**: 125 pounds.
2. **Alex's weight**: According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2
   \]
   Substituting Grace's weight into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Alex's weight} = 4 \times 125 - 2
   \]
   Calculating \(4 \times 125\):
   \[
   4 \times 125 = 500

   T = W + L = 22
   \]

2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
2L = 14
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
L = 7
\]

Now that we have the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won using the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[
W = 7 + 8 = 15

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **Annual Salary**: To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = 600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]

3. **Salary Increase**: After five years, Sylvie is eligible for a 10% increase on her initial salary. The increase is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 7200 = 720

2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Since the sauce is half the volume of the canned tomatoes used, we can calculate the volume of canned tomatoes she started with:

1. There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

After the first 15 minutes, the total number of cars that have driven through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \) (the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that remained in the traffic jam after the first 15 minutes is:

\[
30 - x - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
25 - x
\]

Now, we know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam (both in the first and second 15 minutes) plus the cars that took the exit should equal the original number of cars minus the cars that remained in the traffic jam. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 20 + 5 = 30 - (25 - x)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x + 25 = 30 - 25 + x
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
x + 25 = 5 + x
\]

Subtracting \( x \) from both sides gives:

\[
25 = 5
\]

This is a contradiction, which indicates that we need to reconsider the interpretation of the problem. 

Instead, we can directly analyze the situation:

1. Let’s assume \( x \) is the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.
2. After the first 15 minutes, the number of cars left is \( 30 - x - 5 \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, so the total number of cars that drove through is \( x + 20 \).

Since we know that 5 cars exited, we can conclude that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:

\[
x + 20 + 5 = 30 - (25 - x)
\]

This means that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the original number of cars minus the cars that remained in the jam.

Thus, we can conclude that:

- The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).
- The number of cars that remained in the jam after the first 15 minutes is \( 25 - x \).

Since we know that 20 cars drove through in the second 15 minutes, we can conclude that:

\[
x + 20 = 30 - (25 - x)
\]

This leads us to:

\[
x + 20 = 5 + x
\]

This means that the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:

\[
x = 0
\]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 0.

102,"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his drinking habits.

During the weekdays (Monday to Friday), John drinks water at the following times:
- Breakfast: 1 glass
- Lunch: 1 glass
- Dinner: 1 glass
- Before bed: 1 glass

This totals to:
1 (breakfast) + 1 (lunch) + 1 (dinner) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses of water per day.

Since there are 5 weekdays, we calculate the total for the weekdays:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water during the weekdays.

On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks water only at breakfast and lunch, and he has soda with dinner. Therefore, on the weekends, he drinks:
- Breakfast: 1 glass
- Lunch: 1 glass
- Dinner: 0 glasses (soda instead)
- Before bed: 1 glass

This totals to:
1 (breakfast) + 1 (lunch) + 0 (dinner) + 1 (before bed) = 3 glasses of water per day.

For the weekends, we calculate the total:
3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses of water during the weekends.

Now, we combine the totals from the weekdays and the weekends:
20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses of water in total for the week.

103,"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to understand the rate at which the fog bank moves.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We can calculate the speed of the fog bank in miles per minute:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire width of the city, which is 42 miles. We can use the speed we calculated to find the time it takes to cover 42 miles:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time} = 42 \div 0.3 = 140 \text{ minutes}

   Poppy places a quarter of the pieces:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces:**
   After Poppy places 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750

4. **Calculate the number of pieces left to be placed:**
   After Poppy's mom places 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500

1. **Determine how many cookies Amir eats**: 
   Amir eats 5 cookies.

2. **Calculate how many cookies Cody eats**: 
   According to the problem, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Therefore, we can calculate Cody's cookies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times \text{Amir's cookies} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both**: 
   To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we add the number of cookies each of them eats:
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies} = 5 + 15 = 20
   \]

Thus, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir together is 20.

106,"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are:
- Length = 5 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Height = 4 inches

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract twice the wall thickness from each dimension to find the inner dimensions. This is because the thickness affects both sides of each dimension.

1. **Calculate the inner length:**
   \[
   \text{Inner Length} = \text{Outer Length} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the inner width:**
   \[
   \text{Inner Width} = \text{Outer Width} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the inner height:**
   \[
   \text{Inner Height} = \text{Outer Height} - 2 \times \text{Wall Thickness} = 4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now we have the inner dimensions of one box:
- Inner Length = 3 inches
- Inner Width = 4 inches
- Inner Height = 2 inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for volume:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
\]
Substituting the inner dimensions:
\[
\text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume:
\[
\text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

- **Monday**: 1 hour (1 episode)
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour (1 episode)
- **Wednesday**: Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched. Since each episode is 0.5 hours, he watched \( 0.5x \) hours.
- **Thursday**: 1 hour (1 episode) + 0.5 hours (1 episode) = 1.5 hours
- **Friday**: 2 hours (2 episodes)

Now, we can sum up the total hours he watched:

\[
1 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7
\]

Combining the known hours:

\[
1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5
\]

Now we can set up the equation:

\[
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
\]

To isolate \( 0.5x \), we subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[
0.5x = 7 - 5.5
\]
\[
0.5x = 1.5
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.5:

\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3

According to the problem, Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, which means he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. Therefore, the total number of cookies he actually baked is:

\[
2x + 15
\]

After baking, he accidentally drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
\]

We know from the problem that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Thus, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 110 - 10
\]
\[
2x = 100
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{100}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50

1. The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
2. If someone buys 10 gallons, the total cost before cashback is:
   \[
   10 \text{ gallons} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30.00 \text{ dollars}

**Step 1: Calculate Beatrice's total roll-ups.**
Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. The total number of roll-ups she has can be calculated by multiplying the width by the length:

\[
\text{Total roll-ups for Beatrice} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Marcell's total roll-ups.**
Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. Similarly, we calculate the total number of roll-ups he has:

\[
\text{Total roll-ups for Marcell} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \times 14 = 42

**Step 4: Calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten.**
To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of participants (which is 2):

1. **Calculate the total distance to shore:**
   Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can find out how far she would row in that time.

   The rowing speed can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total distance she would row in 64 seconds:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water was taken on for 80 feet, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Water intake rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total water intake for 80 feet:
   \[
   \text{Total Water} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Number of boards = 10
     - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Number of boards = 5
     - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

   - Total cost of all lumber = Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price after the price increase:**
   - The price of lumber has increased by 50%. Therefore, the new selling price for each type of board is:
     - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
       - New price = Original price + (50% of Original price)
       - New price = $10 + (0.50 * $10) = $10 + $5 = $15
     
     - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
       - New price = $16 + (50% of $16)
       - New price = $16 + (0.50 * $16) = $16 + $8 = $24

First, we can determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
- Total parts = 7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts.

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can express this in terms of the parts:

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later**:
   - Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to find out how much Lylah's salary increased. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago, so we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - If we assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (which is 40%), then Lylah's salary four years later is:
     \[
     L_{new} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L

- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
- The total number of fruits Morisette brought is:
  \[
  5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits}
  \]

Next, we calculate how many fruits Kael brought:

- Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples}
  \]
- Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought:
  \[
  \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges}
  \]
- The total number of fruits Kael brought is:
  \[
  10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits}

We know the total number of cars is 20, and we have the following breakdown:

- Manual cars: 4

Now, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula for percentage is:

Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) × 100

Substituting the values we have:

Percentage = (4 / 20) × 100

142,"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we first need to calculate how many hours he would work in a week.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he spends playing video games in a week is:

\[
2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week}
\]

If Jordan were to work instead of playing video games, he would work those 14 hours in a week. 

Next, we know that he earns $10 for every hour he works. Therefore, his total earnings for the week would be:

\[
14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week}

Thus, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $140 in one week.

The items John bought are:
- Milk: 2 dollars (food)
- Eggs: 3 dollars (food)
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars (non-food)
- Cups: 3 dollars (non-food)
- Roach traps: 4 dollars (non-food)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of food items, the cost of non-food items, and the tax on non-food items:
Total cost = Cost of food items + Cost of non-food items + Tax
Total cost = 5 + 10 + 1 = 16 dollars.

1. **Total Clients**: 
   - Kim currently has 3 clients and is considering 5 potential clients.
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

2. **Supplies Needed per Client**:
   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - Total bottles of bleach needed = 2 bottles/client * 8 clients = 16 bottles.
   - Total packs of cloths needed = 1 pack/client * 8 clients = 8 packs.

3. **Cost of Supplies**:
   - Cost of bleach: Each bottle costs $2.
     - Total cost for bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.
   - Cost of cloths: Each pack costs $5.
     - Total cost for cloths = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.

4. **Total Expenses**:
   - Total expenses = Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths
   - Total expenses = $32 + $40 = $72.

5. **Total Income**:
   - Kim's total income each week is $92.

6. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses
   - Profit = $92 - $72 = $20.

1. **Calculate the total number of pineapples:**
   - John has 10 hectares of land.
   - There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples is:
     \[
     \text{Total pineapples} = \text{hectares} \times \text{pineapples per hectare} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

2. **Determine how many times John can harvest in a year:**
   - John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
     \[
     \text{Number of harvests} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months per harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples each time he harvests, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
     \[
     \text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = \text{Total pineapples per harvest} \times \text{Number of harvests} = 1000 \times 4 = 4000 \text{ pineapples}

Anakin's catches:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Now, we calculate Locsin's catches:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin:
  \[
  \text{Locsin's starfish} = 10 - 5 = 5
  \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin:
  \[
  \text{Locsin's sea horses} = 6 - 3 = 3
  \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin:
  \[
  \text{Locsin's clownfish} = 3 + 2 = 5
  \]

Now we can summarize the total catches:
- Anakin's total:
  \[
  10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19
  \]
- Locsin's total:
  \[
  5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13

Now, we add both totals together to find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
\[
\text{Total fish} = 19 + 13 = 32

162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we first need to understand how the price increases over time.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase**: The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. The original price is $20, so the increase every two months is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   Therefore, every two months, the price increases by $4.

3. **Total Duration**: We need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18

1. **If Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - She will miss out on 3 hours of freelance work.
   - The income she loses from this is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Lost income} = \text{Hours missed} \times \text{Income per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}

2. **If Jackie hires the accountant:**
   - The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, we can compare the two scenarios:

- **Cost of doing taxes herself:** $105 (lost income)
- **Cost of hiring the accountant:** $90

Next, we find the difference in money Jackie will have by hiring the accountant instead of doing the taxes herself:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Lost income} - \text{Cost of accountant} = 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}

2. **Cost of the scanner**: €157
3. **Cost of the CD burner**: €74
4. **Cost of the printer**: €102

Now, we will add these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add the cost of the computer and the scanner:
  \[
  1090 + 157 = 1247

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[
\text{Total eggs needed} = 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs}
\]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get at least 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:

\[
\text{Number of babysitting sessions} = \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/session}} = 5 \text{ sessions}

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
\]

Substituting \( S \) with \( 2B \):

\[
(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( S_{32} = 8 \) (Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old)
2. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, we have \( S_4 = S_{32} = 8 \).
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so:

Now, to find the number of votes the loser received, we subtract the votes of the winner from the total votes:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner} = 80 - 60 = 20

1. **Identify the ages**: We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can express Jean's age in terms of Mark's age.

2. **Define variables**:
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Then Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

3. **Use the information from two years ago**:
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
     \]

4. **Calculate half of Jan's age and add 5**:
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Adding 5 gives us \( 14 + 5 = 19 \).

5. **Set up the equation**:
   - Now we can set up the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 19

6. **Solve for Mark's age**:
   - Adding 2 to both sides gives:
     \[
     M = 19 + 2 = 21

7. **Find Jean's age**:
   - Since Jean is two years older than Mark:
     \[
     \text{Jean's age} = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23

**Team A (well-rounded team):**
Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for Team A is:
\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Team B (less well-rounded team):**
The first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, we calculate the total time for Team B:
\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171

Thus, the total time for Team B is 222 seconds.

**Calculating the difference:**
Now we find the difference in total time between the two teams:

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6).
   - The total number of outcomes is 6.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 
   - There are 3 even numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (independent events) is:
     \[
     P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two evens}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
   \]

4. **Expressing the difference as a percentage:**
   To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.25 \times 100 = 25\%

1. **Rats**: 
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

2. **Hamsters**:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is:

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:
\[
\text{Straw for rats} + \text{Straw for hamsters} + \text{Straw for rabbits} = 160
\]
Substituting the expressions we found:
\[
18r + 50h + 20 = 160
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
18r + 50h = 140
\]

Next, we can simplify this equation. We can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \) or vice versa. However, since we are looking for integer solutions, we can try different values for \( r \) and see if \( h \) remains an integer.

Let's rearrange the equation:
\[
50h = 140 - 18r

Now, we will test integer values for \( r \):

- **If \( r = 2 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 2}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **If \( r = 3 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 3}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **If \( r = 4 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 4}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **If \( r = 5 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 5}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad (\text{integer})
  \]

- **If \( r = 6 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 6}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad (\text{not an integer})

- **If \( r = 7 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18 \times 7}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad (\text{not an integer})

\[
A = P(1 + r)^n
\]

In this case:
- \( P = 100 \) (the initial amount owed)
- \( r = 0.02 \) (the monthly interest rate of 2%)
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of months)

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

1. **Calculate the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
     \[
     \text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total payment from Publisher A is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Calculate the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Thus, the payment per sentence from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment per sentence from Publisher B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - The total payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - The total earnings from both publishers is:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Payment from Publisher A} + \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}

In the morning, he collects 5 pails of water, and in the afternoon, he collects 6 pails of water. 

So, the total number of pails he collects in one day is:
5 pails (morning) + 6 pails (afternoon) = 11 pails.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, to find the total amount of water in liters, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters per pail:

Total liters of water = Total pails × Liters per pail
Total liters of water = 11 pails × 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters.

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**: 
   Since Brinley will drop the lowest score, we need to consider the total of the five highest scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over 5 tests, we multiply the desired average by 5:
   \[
   93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**:
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We first calculate the sum of these scores:
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Determine the lowest score**:
   The lowest score among the five is 71. If Brinley drops this score, we need to find out what score she needs on the sixth test to reach the total of 465.

4. **Set up the equation**:
   Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. After dropping the lowest score (71), the total score will be:
   \[
   438 - 71 + x = 465

   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
     \[
     \text{Weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \text{ bars} \times 40 \text{ g/bar} = 1000 \text{ g}
     \]

2. **Weight of Candied Apples**:
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, we can find the weight of each candied apple:
     \[
     \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ g}}{2} = 20 \text{ g}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples is:

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Half a dozen plates means \(6 / 2 = 3\) plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 plates is:

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - According to the problem, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

1. **Cost of the jacket**: $30
2. **Cost of each pair of shoes**: $20
3. **Total cost for 2 pairs of shoes**: 2 * $20 = $40

Now, we can find the total cost of the jacket and shoes:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of jacket} + \text{Cost of shoes} = 30 + 40 = 70

Next, we calculate how much money Sara has after babysitting and her initial savings.

1. **Earnings from babysitting**: She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time.

2. **Total money Sara has before mowing the lawn**: She had $10 saved before babysitting.
   \[
   \text{Total money before mowing} = \text{Initial savings} + \text{Earnings from babysitting} = 10 + 20 = 30
   \]

Now, we find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes:

\[
\text{Money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money before mowing} = 70 - 30 = 40

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs produced by the chickens is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( w = r + 2 \).

Next, we can express the total egg production in terms of \( r \) and \( w \):
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
- White chickens produce 5 eggs each, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).

Putting this together, we can write the equation for the total egg production:
\[
3r + 5w = 42
\]

Now, we can substitute \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms results in:
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32

Now, divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Thus, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To find the number of white chickens, we can substitute \( r \) back into the equation for \( w \):
\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Finally, we can verify the total egg production:
- Red chickens produce \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs.
- White chickens produce \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs.
- Total eggs = \( 12 + 30 = 42 \), which matches the given information.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, each pool would lose:

\[
4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}

Now, we can calculate the current amounts of water in both pools:

- The small pool now has:

S - 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

- The big pool now has:
\[

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
2S - 16 = 4S - 64

2S - 4S = -64 + 16

\[
-2S = -48

\[
S = 24

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now that we have the number of roses and dahlias, we can find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

218,"Let's denote the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack as \( A \), \( H \), and \( Z \) respectively.

We know from the problem that:
1. Harriet's current age \( H = 21 \).
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age: \( A = 3H \).
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack: \( H = \frac{1}{2}Z \).

Now, we can calculate Adrian's and Zack's ages using Harriet's age.

First, calculate Adrian's age:
\[
A = 3H = 3 \times 21 = 63
\]

Next, calculate Zack's age:
\[
H = \frac{1}{2}Z \implies Z = 2H = 2 \times 21 = 42
\]

Now we have the current ages:
- Adrian: \( 63 \)
- Harriet: \( 21 \)
- Zack: \( 42 \)

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Now, we can calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{A + H + Z}{3} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3}
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
66 + 24 + 45 = 135
\]

Now, divide by 3 to find the average:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \( 45 \).

- Naomi's score: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri's score: \( Y \)
- Brianna's score: \( B \)
- Jojo's score: \( J \)

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
   \[
   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now we can find Jojo's score using the total points scored by all students:
\[
N + Y + B + J = 251
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
\]

Calculating the sum of Naomi's, Yuri's, and Brianna's scores:
\[
68 + 44 = 112
\]
\[
112 + 85 = 197
\]

Now we can substitute this back into the equation:
\[
197 + J = 251
\]

To find Jojo's score, we subtract 197 from 251:
\[
J = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Thus, Jojo scored 54 points.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias together:

4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **Sauces**: 2 sauces at $0.25 each, which totals \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
6. **Upgrade for chips and drink**: $3.00

Now, we can add these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add the base burrito and extra meat:
  \[
  6.50 + 2.00 = 8.50
  \]
- Next, add the extra cheese:
  \[
  8.50 + 1.00 = 9.50

1. **Jessa's Age**: We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age**: The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. Since Jessa is 20, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age**: The problem also states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Now we have the ages of all three girls:
- Jessa: 20 years
- Joan: 25 years
- Mary: 23 years

4. **Sum of Their Ages**: To find the sum of their ages, we add them together:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23

   \]

2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, which gives us:
   \[
   Jn = 2R
   \]

We are given that John has 54 candies:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike has left**: 
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he has left is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week**:
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - With 3 pen pals, the total number of letters sent to Mike per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of pages written by the pen pals**:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages sent to Mike per week is:

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[
   A_a = J_a + 8
   \]
   where \( A_a \) is the number of apples Andrea has.

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[
   A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b
   \]
   where \( A_b \) is the number of bananas Andrea has.

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[
   J_b = J_a + 4
   \]

We are given that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[
A_a = 52
\]

Using the first equation, we can find Jamal's apples:
\[
52 = J_a + 8
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:
\[
J_a = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

Now we can find Jamal's bananas using the third equation:
\[
J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
\]

Next, we can find Andrea's bananas using the second equation:
\[
A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas:
  \[
  A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76
  \]
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas:
  \[
  J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92

Today, Carla is making 36 cookies, and tomorrow she is making 30 cookies. 

First, we add the number of cookies she will make today and tomorrow:
\[
36 \text{ cookies (today)} + 30 \text{ cookies (tomorrow)} = 66 \text{ cookies (total)}
\]

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies (which is 12 cookies). To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we first determine how many dozens are in 66 cookies:
\[
\frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5.5 \text{ dozens}
\]

Now, since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed for 5.5 dozens:
\[
5.5 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 11 \text{ cups of flour}

1. **Calculate two thirds of the total pennies:**
   \[
   \text{Two thirds of 9,300} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
   \]
   To perform this calculation, we can first divide 9,300 by 3:
   \[
   9,300 \div 3 = 3,100
   \]
   Now, multiply by 2:
   \[
   3,100 \times 2 = 6,200
   \]
   So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

2. **Convert pennies to dollars:**
   Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we convert the number of pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:
   \[
   \text{Total dollars} = \frac{6,200}{100} = 62

3. **Calculate the number of trees Harry has**: 
   Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. 
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:

   - Therefore, Sean has to memorize 54 lines from the song.

2. **First Scene**: 
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. 
   - So, the total number of lines in the first scene is \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.

1. **Time for small holes**:
   - Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes = 30
   - Total time for small holes = 30 holes × 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes

2. **Time for large holes**:
   - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = 15 holes × 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes

3. **Total time**:
   - Total time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. **Convert minutes to hours**:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert 240 minutes to hours:

1. Current sum of their ages: 20 years.
2. In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 and Marco will be R + 10, where M and R are their current ages.
3. The new sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20.

Since M + R = 20, we can substitute that into the equation:

M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40 years.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( s + 9 \) and Ruby's age will be \( 6s + 9 \).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This gives us the equation:

\[
6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

\[
6s + 9 = 3s + 27
\]

Next, we will isolate \( s \) by moving all terms involving \( s \) to one side and constant terms to the other side:

\[
6s - 3s = 27 - 9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[

Let \( x \) be the number of spots on a mamba. According to the information given:

\[
70 = 2x
\]

To find \( x \), we can divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{70}{2} = 35
\]

So, a mamba has 35 spots.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. 

There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots from the cobras is:

\[
\text{Total spots from cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800

Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:

\[
\text{Length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}

3. **Calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   To find out how many days the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:

1. **Calculate the total miles driven per day:**
   - The distance to work is 30 miles one way.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is:
     \[
     30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total miles driven per week:**
   - John goes to work 5 days a week, so the total miles driven in a week is:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**
   - John works for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven in a year is:
     \[
     300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year}

When a single sheet of paper is folded in half, it creates 4 pages. The arrangement of the pages on the folded sheet is as follows:

- The front of the folded sheet has two pages: one on the left and one on the right.
- The back of the folded sheet also has two pages: one on the left and one on the right.

For a tabloid with 32 pages, we can calculate the number of sheets needed by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet:

\[
\text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8

1. **Total Books**: Elise has a collection of 250 books.
2. **Unsold Books**: There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. **Books Sold This Year**: Elise sold 45 books this year.

From the total number of books and the unsold books, we can calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:

\[
\text{Total Sold} = \text{Total Books} - \text{Unsold Books} = 250 - 50 = 200
\]

Now, we know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (this year), which is given as 45. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:

\[
\text{Books Sold in First Year} = 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90
\]

Let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the second year. The total number of books sold over the three years can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Books Sold in First Year} + \text{Books Sold in Second Year} + \text{Books Sold in Current Year} = 200
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
90 + y + 45 = 200
\]

Now, we can solve for \( y \):

\[
135 + y = 200
\]
\[
y = 200 - 135 = 65
\]

So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so the earnings from the second year are:

\[
\text{Earnings in Second Year} = \text{Books Sold in Second Year} \times \text{Price per Book} = 65 \times 20

1. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours worked in a week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Total weekly earnings including the bonus = $500 (from hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Since April starts on a Saturday in 2023, it has 4 full weeks and 2 extra days.
   - Therefore, there are 4 full weeks in April.

John arm wrestles a total of 20 people and beats 80% of them. To calculate the number of people he beat, we can use the following formula:

Number of people beaten = Total number of people × Percentage beaten

Substituting the values:

Number of people beaten = 20 × 0.80 = 16

Now, to find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

Number of people lost to = Total number of people - Number of people beaten

Substituting the values:

Number of people lost to = 20 - 16 = 4

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means his weekly weight loss is:

\[
\text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose those 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same total weight as Joey does in 4 weeks (which is 8 pounds), we can calculate:

\[
\text{Total weight Sandy needs to lose} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks, we can find out how many 4-week periods it will take for her to lose 8 pounds:

\[
\text{Number of 4-week periods} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ periods}

1. **Calculate the cost of the business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   - Total cost for suits = 6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

2. **Calculate the cost of the suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   - Total cost for suitcases = 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150.

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
   - Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket

- The number of players on special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of special teams players is \( \frac{d}{2} \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of team members:

319,"To find the total number of electric poles required, we start with the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Let:
- \( P \) = number of electric poles
- \( W \) = number of electric wires

From the ratio, we can express the relationship as:
\[ P : W = 1 : 3 \]

This can be rewritten in terms of a variable \( x \):
- \( P = 1x \)
- \( W = 3x \)

We know from the problem that the total number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 45 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of electric poles \( P \):
\[ P = 1x = 1 \times 15 = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

Initially, there were:
- 25 men
- 15 women

So, the total number of people at the beginning is:
\[ 
25 + 15 = 40 
\]

After an hour, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left. We calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40:
\[ 
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 
\]

This means that 10 people left the party. Therefore, the number of people remaining at the party is:
\[ 
40 - 10 = 30 
\]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find out how many women are left, we can subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of people remaining:
\[ 
\text{Number of women remaining} = \text{Total remaining} - \text{Men remaining} 
\]
\[ 
\text{Number of women remaining} = 30 - 22 = 8

   \[
   \text{Cost of Magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of Book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]
   So, the magazine costs $2.

3. **Cost of the Pen**: The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Pen} = \text{Cost of Magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1

1. **Calculate Jam's total pencils:**
   - Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils.
   - We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. Since we know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils}
     \]
     Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Then:
     \[
     3x + 2 = 26
     \]
     Subtracting 2 from both sides gives:
     \[
     3x = 24
     \]
     Dividing by 3 gives:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, each box contains 8 pencils.

2. **Calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:**
   - Jam has 3 boxes of 8 pencils each, which is:
     \[
     3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ pencils}
     \]
   - Adding the 2 loose pencils gives:
     \[
     24 + 2 = 26 \text{ pencils}

   - This confirms our earlier calculation.

3. **Calculate Meg's total pencils:**
   - Meg has 46 pencils.

4. **Calculate the total number of pencils for both Jam and Meg:**
   - Adding Jam's and Meg's pencils together gives:
     \[
     26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils}
     \]

5. **Determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils:**
   - If each box can hold 8 pencils, we can find the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{72}{8} = 9

1. **Cooling Effect**: Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required.

   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling needed}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:

   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

2. **Adding Cream**: Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to the coffee. This also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

3. **Total Weakening**: Now, we combine the weakening effects from both the ice cubes and the cream:

   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

So, there are 20 cows. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, we have:

\[
2x = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Thus, there are 40 chickens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total legs} = (\text{Number of chickens} \times 2) + (\text{Number of cows} \times 4)
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total legs} = (40 \times 2) + (20 \times 4)
\]

Calculating each part:

\[
40 \times 2 = 80
\]
\[
20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Now, adding these together:

\[
\text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 = 160

Let's break down the number of balls he is juggling each week:

- **Week 1**: 3 balls
- **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
- **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
- **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

By the end of the fourth week, Josh is practicing with 6 balls.

When he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls. Out of these 3 balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 gets lost completely. 

So, after dropping 3 balls, he has:

- Initially had 6 balls
- Dropped 3 balls
- 2 were caught, leaving him with 1 ball lost

Thus, the number of balls he has left is:

6 (initial) - 3 (dropped) = 3 balls remaining.

Therefore, when Josh starts to juggle on stage, he has 3 balls.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy has**: Billy starts with $10.

2. **Calculate the cost of gumballs**: Billy buys 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05. Therefore, the total cost for the gumballs is:
   \[
   40 \text{ gumballs} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/gumball} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the change after buying gumballs**: After spending $2 on gumballs, the amount of money Billy has left is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dollars} - 2 \text{ dollars} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much he spends on candy**: Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy candy. Therefore, the amount he spends on candy is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of candy per pound**: The candy costs $1.5 per pound.

6. **Determine how many pounds of candy he buys**: To find out how many pounds of candy he can buy with $4, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/pound}} = \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{40}{15} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ pounds}

From the problem, we know that:
1. Carver's age \( C = 45 \) years.
2. Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   C = 2S - 5
   \]

Now, we can substitute Carver's age into the equation:
\[
45 = 2S - 5
\]

Next, we will solve for \( S \). First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[
45 + 5 = 2S
\]
\[
50 = 2S
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{50}{2} = 25

3. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city. First, we calculate the combined distance:
   \[
   d_{1 \to 2} + d_{2 \to 3} = 75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]
   Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is:
   \[
   d_{3 \to 1} = 175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip (from the first city to the second, to the third, and back to the first):**
   \[
   \text{Total distance for one trip} = d_{1 \to 2} + d_{2 \to 3} + d_{3 \to 1} = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}

     \]
   - So, the time taken to reach his friend's house is:
     \[

2. **Drive Back Home:**
   - The distance for the return trip is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken to drive back home is:
     \[
     \text{Time back home} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}

Next, we know that Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests combined. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many points she needs on the third test (let's call this score \( x \)):

33 + x ≥ 42

To find \( x \), we can rearrange the inequality:

   where:
   - Principal = $3,650
   - Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10
   - Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount owed**: The total amount Karan has to pay back is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \approx 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment**: Since Karan will pay this total amount over 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \approx 760.416

The choir has a total of 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the choir is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 52 = \frac{50}{100} \times 52 = 26
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls were able to perform on the day of the performance. It is stated that half of the people performing could not make it to the show. Since only the female members are performing, we calculate half of the girls:

\[
\text{Number of girls who could not make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
\]

Thus, the number of girls who could perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who could perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

In addition to the girls, the choir has 3 teachers who decide to sing with them. Therefore, we add the number of teachers to the number of girls who could perform:

\[
\text{Total performers} = \text{Number of girls who could perform} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16

1. **Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu: $10 per month
   - Disney Plus: $10 per month

   Normally, the total cost without any discounts would be:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}

402,"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy for his quadruple batch of brownies, we first need to calculate the total amounts of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch.

1. **Calculate the total flour needed:**
   The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. For a quadruple batch, we multiply this by 4:
   \[
   3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups of flour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total milk needed:**
   The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply this by 4:
   \[
   1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups of milk}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bags of flour are needed:**
   Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To find out how many bags Mark needs, we divide the total cups of flour by the cups per bag:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags of flour}
   \]

4. **Determine how many bottles of milk are needed:**
   Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To find out how many bottles Mark needs, we divide the total cups of milk by the cups per bottle:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles of milk}
   \]

5. **Calculate the difference between bags of flour and bottles of milk:**
   Now we find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
   \[
   6 \text{ bags of flour} - 2 \text{ bottles of milk} = 4

403,"To find out how much electric energy Mel will save by reducing the use of his air conditioner, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner for the original and reduced usage.

1. **Original Usage**:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = Power (in watts) × Time (in hours)
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts × 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours per day.

2. **Reduced Usage**:
   - If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will now use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption with reduced usage = 900 watts × 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours per day.

3. **Energy Savings per Day**:
   - Energy savings per day = Original daily consumption - Reduced daily consumption
   - Energy savings per day = 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

4. **Total Savings in 30 Days**:
   - Total savings over 30 days = Energy savings per day × Number of days
   - Total savings = 4500 watt-hours/day × 30 days = 135000 watt-hours.

5. **Convert to Kilowatt-hours**:
   - Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours, we convert the total savings to kilowatt-hours.
   - Total savings in kWh = 135000 watt-hours ÷ 1000 = 135 kWh.

Thus, the total amount of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, to find out how many sandwiches are needed for 20 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of meat and cheese required for these 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

\[
\text{Total meat} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
\text{Total cheese} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we can calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.

Calculating the total cost for the meat:

\[
\text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Calculating the total cost for the cheese:

\[
\text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the costs of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35.00 \text{ dollars} + 15.00 \text{ dollars} = 50.00 \text{ dollars}

   \[
   \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Total Initial Count**: Before any purchases, the total number of items (corns and cannolis) Allan has is:
   \[
   \text{Total initial} = \text{Number of cannolis} + \text{Number of corns} = 40 + 80 = 120
   \]

4. **Purchases**: Allan buys 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has after the purchase. After buying 60 more cannolis, the new count of cannolis is:

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

In May, the company hired 40 employees, and each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

First, we calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[
\text{Weekly payment per employee} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week} = 15 \times 40 = 600
\]

Next, we calculate the total payment for all 40 employees in May:
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees} = 600 \times 40 = 24000
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees who remained in June is:
\[
\text{Remaining employees} = 40 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40\right) = 40 - 10 = 30

The payment for the remaining 30 employees in June is calculated similarly:
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Remaining employees} = 600 \times 30 = 18000

Now, we add the costs of the taffy:
- Total cost of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:
- Cost of seashells = $1.50.

Now, we calculate the cost of the magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets.
- Total cost of magnets = 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations. First, we can isolate \( D \) in Equation 1:

D = 180 - C
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( D \) into Equation 2:

From the problem, we know:
- The cost of the tattered jeans is \( T = 28 \).
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can express this as:
  \[
  J = T - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much Cole saved on each pair of jeans. He saved a total of $6, and he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let \( S_J \) be the savings from the jogger jeans and \( S_T \) be the savings from the tattered jeans. According to the problem:
\[
S_J + S_T = 6
\]
And since he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans:
\[
S_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
\]
Thus, the savings from the tattered jeans can be calculated as:
\[
S_T = 6 - S_J = 6 - 2 = 4
\]

Now, we need to find the original prices of the jeans before the savings were applied. The original price of the jogger jeans can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Original price of jogger jeans} = J + S_J = 22 + 2 = 24
\]
And the original price of the tattered jeans is:
\[
\text{Original price of tattered jeans} = T + S_T = 28 + 4 = 32

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[

3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 bird feeders.

Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. However, the feeders that Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. 

Let's break it down:

1. The 3 bird feeders that Lillian built attract:
   20 (base attraction) + 10 (additional attraction) = 30 birds each.

2. The 3 bird feeders that Lillian bought attract:
   20 birds each.

Now we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- Total birds from the built feeders:
  3 (built feeders) × 30 (birds per built feeder) = 90 birds.

- Total birds from the bought feeders:
  3 (bought feeders) × 20 (birds per bought feeder) = 60 birds.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted by both types of feeders:

Total birds = 90 (from built feeders) + 60 (from bought feeders) = 150 birds.

The caterer was instructed to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them (which is 18 guests) expected to eat two hotdogs each. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is:

\[
\text{Total hotdogs prepared} = 18 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs/guest} + 18 \text{ guests} \times 1 \text{ hotdog/guest} = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hotdogs}

**Elizabeth's beads:**
- She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces.

Calculating Elizabeth's total:
- Red beads: 1 pack × 20 pieces/pack = 20 pieces
- Clear beads: 2 packs × 20 pieces/pack = 40 pieces

Total beads for Elizabeth:
20 pieces (red) + 40 pieces (clear) = 60 pieces

**Margareth's beads:**
- She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.

Calculating Margareth's total:
- Blue beads: 3 packs × 20 pieces/pack = 60 pieces
- Red beads: 4 packs × 20 pieces/pack = 80 pieces

Total beads for Margareth:
60 pieces (blue) + 80 pieces (red) = 140 pieces

**Now, we compare the totals:**
- Elizabeth has 60 pieces.
- Margareth has 140 pieces.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
140 pieces (Margareth) - 60 pieces (Elizabeth) = 80 pieces.

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

442,"To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**: Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees for each hour. Therefore, the total increase in temperature from baking is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Cooling from Opening the Window**: After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, in 30 minutes, the total cooling is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Now, we subtract this cooling from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house after baking and then cooling is:

443,"To solve the problem, we first need to calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon and then determine James's total time based on the information given.

1. **Calculate Jon's total time:**
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes

   Total time for Jon:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate James's swim time:**
   James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ minutes} = 0.1 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, James's swim time is:
   \[
   \text{James's swim time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate James's bike time:**
   James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike:
   \[
   \text{James's bike time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate James's total time without the run:**
   Now we can calculate James's total time for the swim and bike:
   \[
   \text{James's total time (swim + bike)} = 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Determine Jon's total time advantage:**
   Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James's total time for the triathlon is:
   \[
   \text{James's total time} = \text{Jon's total time} - 10 = 170 - 10 = 160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate James's run time:**
   Now we can find out how long James took for the run:
   \[
   \text{James's run time} = \text{James's total time} - \text{James's total time (swim + bike)} = 160 - 121 = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is 39 minutes.

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 MPH**:
   - First, convert 30 minutes into hours: 
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Now, calculate the distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Determine how much hay the horse eats**:
   - The horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) bail of hay for every mile. Therefore, for 16 miles:
     \[
     \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay**:
   - Each bail of hay costs $3. Thus, the total cost for 8 bails is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Michael has**:
   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}

Given that the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45
\]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 
   - He buys 2 boxes of 1 pound each.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots**: 
   - He buys 4 bags of 12 pounds each.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay**: 
   - He buys 42 bales of 75 pounds each.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats**: 
   - He buys 20 sacks of 65 pounds each.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Now, we sum all these weights to find the total weight of the feed:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of sugar cubes} + \text{Weight of carrots} + \text{Weight of hay} + \text{Weight of oats}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many trips the farmer needs to make with his truck, which can carry 2250 pounds at a time. We calculate the number of trips by dividing the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Truck capacity}} = \frac{4500}{2250}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = 2

1. We know that the weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains.
2. The problem states that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

To calculate the weight of the 2010 penny, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny}
\]

Substituting the weight of the 1959 penny:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3 \times 48}{4} = \frac{144}{4} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Now that we have the weight of both pennies, we can find the combined weight:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny}

\]

Next, we find out how many more songs each of them can add to their players. The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs.

For Gabriel, the number of songs he can still add is:

\[
\text{Gabriel's capacity to add} = 100 - \text{Gabriel's songs} = 100 - 20 = 80

501,"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we first need to determine how much yarn each of them used in yards.

1. **Mariah's Yarn Usage**:
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate Mariah's usage as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mariah's usage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
   \]

2. **Grandma's Yarn Usage**:
   - Grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.
   - We calculate Grandma's usage similarly:
   \[
   \text{Grandma's usage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Total Yarn Usage**:
   - Now, we add the yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
   \[
   \text{Total usage} = \text{Mariah's usage} + \text{Grandma's usage} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards.

1. For the first group of friends (2 friends wanting 5 gifts each):
   - Number of gifts = 2 friends × 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

2. For the second group of friends (3 friends wanting 2 gifts each):
   - Number of gifts = 3 friends × 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

3. Now, we add the gifts from both groups:
   - Total gifts from friends = 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts

4. Cherrie also buys 10 more random gifts:
   - Total gifts = 16 gifts + 10 random gifts = 26 gifts

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:

503,"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug based on the width of the chair.

1. **Width of the Chair**: The chair is given to be 3 feet wide.
2. **Width of the Rug**: The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:
   \[
   \text{Width of the Rug} = \text{Width of the Chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Length of the Couch**: The couch is described as being 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We first calculate twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times \text{Width of the Rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:
   \[
   \text{Length of the Couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}

Thus, the length of the couch is \boxed{18}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
504,"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, which cost \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which cost $2.
- 1 small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum. Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total cost:

\[
2x + 2 + 1 = 7
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2x + 3 = 7
\]

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:

\[
2x = 4
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

\[
x = 2
\]

Thus, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

505,"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget of $24, we need to analyze the cost and yield of each type of wood.

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis**:
   - A **2 x 4** costs $4 and produces 200 sticks.
   - A **2 x 8** costs $6 and produces 400 sticks.

2. **Cost per Stick Calculation**:
   - For the **2 x 4**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{4}{200} = 0.02 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]
   - For the **2 x 8**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{6}{400} = 0.015 \text{ dollars per stick}
     \]

From this analysis, we see that the **2 x 8** is cheaper per stick.

3. **Maximizing the Number of Sticks**:
   - To maximize the number of sticks, we should buy as many **2 x 8** pieces as possible within the $24 budget.
   - The maximum number of **2 x 8** pieces Frederick can buy is:
     \[
     \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
     \]
   - If he buys 4 pieces of **2 x 8**, he will produce:
     \[
     \text{Total sticks from 4 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}

4. **Conclusion**:
Since buying 4 pieces of **2 x 8** maximizes the number of popsicle sticks he can make within his budget, the final result is:

506,"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs that the dogs have. Each dog has 4 legs, so for 6 dogs, the total number of legs is:

\[
6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can calculate the number of pairs needed by dividing the total number of legs by 2:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs}
\]

Now, we know that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:

\[
12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars}

507,"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total cost for bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:

\[
2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these trips. Each trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:

\[
10 \text{ trips} \times 2.20 \text{ dollars/trip} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we compare this cost to the price of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much she saves by purchasing the pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips:

\[
22 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars}

Thus, Janet saves $2 by buying the weekly bus pass.

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The problem states that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows}
   \]
4. The problem also states that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep}

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at both the farm and the zoo.

- Total animals at the farm:
  - Cows: 30
  - Sheep: 10
  - Total at the farm: \(30 + 10 = 40\)

- Total animals at the zoo:
  - Cows: 60
  - Sheep: 20
  - Total at the zoo: \(60 + 20 = 80\)

Now, we add the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo:

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. This means:

\[
\text{Total items Rose bought} = 4 \times (\text{Total items Sophia bought})
\]

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Therefore, the total number of items Rose bought is:

\[
12 + 4 = 16
\]

Now, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[
16 = 4 \times (O_S + P_S)
\]

To find \( O_S + P_S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
O_S + P_S = \frac{16}{4} = 4

This means that the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is 4.

Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Daily earnings × Number of days
Total earnings = $30 × 7 = $210

Next, we know that Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week. To find out how much he has left after his expenses, we subtract his total spending from his total earnings:

   - The total number of bags is:
     \[
     8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags}
     \]
   - The cost per pack is $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
     \[
     8 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ dollars/pack} = 32 \text{ dollars}

   - **Passengers remaining after the first stop**: 
     \[
     48 - 8 = 40

Current age of Jame = 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Next, we need to find the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years. We denote Jame's cousin's current age as \( C \).

In 8 years, Jame will be:
Current age of Jame + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, we can express this relationship mathematically:

Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 * (Jame's age in 8 years) - 5
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Now, we can express the cousin's current age \( C \) in terms of his age in 8 years:

Cousin's age in 8 years = Current age of cousin + 8
55 = C + 8

Now, we can solve for \( C \):

C = 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now we have both Jame's and his cousin's current ages:
- Jame's current age = 22 years
- Cousin's current age = 47 years

To find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age:

2. **Cost of the Printer**: The problem states that the printer cost $400 less than the computer. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Printer} = \text{Cost of Computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700

3. **Total Cost of the Computer, Monitors, and Printer**: Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of Monitor} + \text{Cost of Printer}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2400 = 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of Monitor} + 700
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**: Now, we can simplify the equation:
   \[
   2400 = 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of Monitor}

   \[
   600 = 2 \times \text{Cost of Monitor}

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days, and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first half (15 days), he saves:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pages read in the first week.**

Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights in the first week. Therefore, the total time she spent reading in the first week is:

\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the total weekly orders from the flower shops:**
   - First flower shop: 20 roses
   - Second flower shop: 15 roses
   - Third flower shop: 30 roses

   Total weekly orders = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

2. **Calculate how many roses Ford grows in a month:**
   - Ford grows 40 roses every week.
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

   Total roses grown in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

3. **Calculate how many roses Ford lacks:**
   - Total roses needed per month = Total weekly orders * 4 weeks = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses
   - Total roses grown in a month = 160 roses

   Now, we find the difference:
   Roses lacking = Total roses needed - Total roses grown = 260 - 160 = 100 roses

Thus, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

1. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. Therefore, the total revenue (TR) from selling the sandwiches is:
   \[
   TR = 10 \text{ sandwiches} \times 7.00 \text{ dollars/sandwich} = 70.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Costs:**
   The total costs (TC) consist of the cost of bread and the cost of cheeses and condiments.

   - **Cost of Bread:**
     The food truck sources bread for $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they are making 10 sandwiches, they will need 1 loaf of bread:
     \[
     \text{Cost of bread} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
     They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches:
     \[
     \text{Cost of cheeses and condiments} = 30.00 \text{ dollars}

   - **Total Costs:**
     Now, we can sum the costs:
     \[
     TC = \text{Cost of bread} + \text{Cost of cheeses and condiments} = 3.00 + 30.00 = 33.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Net Profit:**
   The net profit (NP) is calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:
   \[
   NP = TR - TC = 70.00 - 33.00 = 37.00 \text{ dollars}

\]

Next, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate can make from these 192 crayons. Since each crayon can be melted down into small pieces, we will assume that each crayon can be considered as one small piece for the purpose of making muffins. Therefore, Kate has 192 small pieces of crayons.

Now, we need to determine how many muffin crayons Kate can make. Each muffin crayon requires 8 small pieces of crayons. We can calculate the number of muffin crayons she can make by dividing the total number of small pieces by the number of pieces needed for one muffin crayon:

\[
\frac{192 \text{ small pieces}}{8 \text{ pieces/muffin}} = 24 \text{ muffin crayons}

2. On day three, he saw 0 birds.
3. On days four and five, he saw a total of 120 birds.
4. On day six, he saw 20 birds.
5. On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's sum these numbers:

- Total birds on days 1 and 2: 50
- Total birds on day 3: 0
- Total birds on days 4 and 5: 120
- Total birds on day 6: 20
- Total birds on day 7: 90

Now we add these totals together:

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Next, we need to find the average number of birds seen per day. Since Mack counted birds over 7 days, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average = Total birds / Number of days = 280 / 7 = 40

Next, we need to find out how many cards his brother has. The problem states that his brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cards the brother has by subtracting 3 from the number of cards the boy has:

Number of cards the brother has = Number of cards the boy has - 3
Number of cards the brother has = 5 - 3 = 2

Now, we can find the total number of cards they have together by adding the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has:

1. **Calculate the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature} = 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage error:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100

This means that Maggie's oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature.

3. **Now, we need to find out what temperature she should set for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. Since her oven is 4% hotter, we can set up the equation:**
   Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set. The actual temperature will be:

1. **Initial Invitations**: Alex invites 100 people.

2. **Friends Invited by Guests**: Each of the 100 invited people says they will bring 2 friends. Therefore, the total number of additional guests from this is:
   \[
   100 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ friends/person} = 200 \text{ friends}
   \]

3. **Alex's Additional Invitations**: Alex also calls 10 of her friends. So, we add these 10 friends to the total count.

4. **Spouses of Alex's Friends**: Out of the 10 friends Alex called, 8 of them will be bringing their spouses. This means we need to add 8 spouses to the total count.

Now, let's calculate the total number of seats needed:

- Total from initial invitations: 100
- Total from friends invited by guests: 200
- Total from Alex's additional friends: 10
- Total from spouses: 8

Now we can sum these values:
\[
100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher, and we know that it weighs 10 pounds.

2. The second dog is a Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Therefore, the weight of the Dachshund is:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Dachshund} = 2 \times \text{Weight of Affenpinscher} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. The third dog is a Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Thus, the weight of the Papillon is:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Papillon} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Weight of Dachshund} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds}

1. **Cost on Amazon:**
   - Price of boots: $16
   - Shipping cost: $4
   - Total cost on Amazon = Price of boots + Shipping cost = $16 + $4 = $20

2. **Cost on eBay:**
   - Price of boots: $13
   - Shipping cost: Twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8
   - Total cost on eBay = Price of boots + Shipping cost = $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we compare the total costs:

- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Total cost on eBay: $21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:

Difference = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon = $21 - $20 = $1

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay than on Amazon.

593,"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we start with the initial height of the beanstalk and its growth pattern.

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of Mark's window**: 20 feet
3. **Growth pattern**: The beanstalk doubles its height every day.

We can express the height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days using the formula:

\[
\text{Height after } n \text{ days} = 4 \times 2^n
\]

We want to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:

\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

To solve this inequality, we can first simplify it:

\[
2^n > \frac{20}{4}
\]
\[
2^n > 5
\]

Next, we can find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition. We can calculate the powers of 2:

- \( 2^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)

From this, we see that:

- \( 2^2 = 4 \) is not greater than 5.
- \( 2^3 = 8 \) is greater than 5.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies \( 2^n > 5 \) is \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

We know that:
- A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.

This means that for every 100 grams of mushrooms, there are 3 grams of protein. Therefore, for 200 grams of mushrooms, we can calculate the protein content as follows:

1. Calculate the protein in 200 grams:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}

Now that we know John consumes 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day, we can calculate his weekly protein intake:

2. Calculate the weekly protein intake:
   \[
   \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams}

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Five years ago, Jerry's age would have been \( x - 5 \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x = 2(x - 5)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 2 on the right side:
   \[
   x = 2x - 10
   \]

2. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2x = -10

   \[
   x = 10

1. **Cost of the implants**:
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - For 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \)

2. **Cost of the crown**:
   - The crown for one implant costs an additional $500.

3. **Total cost before deposit**:
   - Total cost = Cost of implants + Cost of crown
   - Total cost = \( 4000 + 500 = 4500 \)

4. **Subtract the deposit**:
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - Remaining amount to pay = Total cost - Deposit
   - Remaining amount = \( 4500 - 600 = 3900 \)

5. **Calculate hours needed to work**:
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   - Hours needed = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
   - Hours needed = \( 3900 / 15 = 260 \)

Thus, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough to pay for the dental work.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:

\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
6x = 180
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[
x = \frac{180}{6} = 30

Now that we have the smallest angle, we can find the other two angles:

1. The second angle (twice the smallest angle) is:

   2x = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

2. The third angle (three times the smallest angle) is:

Now we have the measures of all three angles in the triangle:
- Smallest angle: \( 30^\circ \)
- Second angle: \( 60^\circ \)
- Largest angle: \( 90^\circ \)

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

1. **Calculate the total number of croissants**: 
   Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day, we first convert dozens to individual croissants:
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ croissants}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of croissants for a week**: 
   Juan plans to make these croissants every day for a week (7 days):
   \[
   48 \text{ croissants/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 336 \text{ croissants}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of butter needed for 336 croissants**: 
   We know that it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. First, we find out how many dozens are in 336 croissants:
   \[
   \frac{336 \text{ croissants}}{12 \text{ croissants/dozen}} = 28 \text{ dozen}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed**: 
   Since it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter for each dozen, we can calculate the total butter needed for 28 dozen:
   \[
   28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of butter Juan will need to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week is:

1. **Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:**
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

2. **Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:**
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $94,060

3. **Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:**
   - Difference = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference = $94,060 - $29,100 = $64,960

Thus, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is $64,960.

611,"John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. This means that for those first 5 months, the total funding is:

\[
\text{Initial funding} = 100,000
\]

After the first 5 months, John finds that his research takes 10 times longer. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:

\[
\text{Total duration} = 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months}
\]

This means that after the initial 5 months, there are:

\[
\text{Remaining months} = 50 \text{ months} - 5 \text{ months} = 45 \text{ months}
\]

For each of these remaining months, the funding required increases by 50% compared to the previous month. We need to calculate the funding for these 45 months.

The funding for the 6th month (the first month after the initial funding) is:

\[
\text{Funding for month 6} = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
\]

For the 7th month, the funding will be:

\[
\text{Funding for month 7} = 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000
\]

Continuing this pattern, we can see that the funding for each month forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 150,000 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

The funding for the \( n \)-th month after the initial 5 months can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Funding for month } n = 150,000 \times (1.5)^{n-6}
\]

To find the total funding for the 45 months, we need to sum the series from month 6 to month 50:

\[
\text{Total funding for months 6 to 50} = 150,000 \sum_{k=0}^{44} (1.5)^k
\]

This is a geometric series with \( n = 45 \) terms, first term \( a = 1 \) (when \( k = 0 \)), and common ratio \( r = 1.5 \). The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
S_{45} = 1 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5} = \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5} = -2(1 - (1.5)^{45})
\]

Now we can calculate \( (1.5)^{45} \). Using a calculator, we find:

\[
(1.5)^{45} \approx 11222.741464
\]

Thus,

\[
S_{45} \approx -2(1 - 11222.741464) = -2(-11221.741464) \approx 22443.482928
\]

Now, we multiply this sum by \( 150,000 \):

\[
\text{Total funding for months 6 to 50} \approx 150,000 \times 22443.482928 \approx 3366522243.92
\]

Finally, we add the initial funding of $100,000 to this total:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 3366522243.92 \approx 3366522343.92
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total cost of John's research is approximately:

\[
\text{Total cost} \approx 3366522344

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   - Meat consumed: 6 ounces

2. The second player ate beef tips, with 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce.
   - Meat consumed: 8 beef tips × 1 ounce each = 8 ounces

3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces:
   - Meat consumed: 16 ounces

4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they consumed 0 ounces of meat.

Now, we can sum the amounts of meat consumed by the players who ate meat:
- Total meat consumed = 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) + 0 ounces (fourth player) + 0 ounces (fifth player)

Calculating this gives:
Total meat consumed = 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

2. **Cost of the rocks**: 
   - She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each.
   - Total cost for rocks = 2 bags × $2.50/bag = $5.00

3. **Cost of the coral**: 
   - She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each.
   - Total cost for coral = 3 pieces × $2.00/piece = $6.00

4. **Cost of the fish**: 
   - She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
   - Total cost for fish = 20 fish × $0.50/fish = $10.00

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars**:
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars**:
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for 10 cars is:

   \[
   \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25

2. **Price of the Gold Jewel**: The price of the gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of the diamond jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:
   \[
   \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600

1. **Bob's speed**: 55 miles per hour
2. **Tom's speed**: 70 miles per hour

The difference in their speeds (relative speed) is:
\[
\text{Relative speed} = \text{Tom's speed} - \text{Bob's speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we know that Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we can use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

In this case, the distance is 75 miles (the gap between them), and the speed is the relative speed of 15 miles per hour:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}

635,"Manny signed up for Karate classes that cost a total of $60 for 10 classes. To find out how much each class costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of classes:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

This means each class costs $6. His parents have set a limit that if the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Since $6 is less than $10, he is currently within the acceptable range.

Now, let's determine how many classes Manny can miss while still keeping the average cost per class at or below $10. If he misses some classes, the total number of classes he actually attends will decrease, which will increase the average cost per class.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \). The total cost remains $60, so the average cost per class after missing \( x \) classes is:

\[
\text{Average cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes attended}} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this average cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve this inequality, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x > 0 \) since he can't miss all classes):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
10x \leq 100 - 60
\]
\[
10x \leq 40
\]
\[
x \leq 4
\]

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 4 classes, he will attend 6 classes, and the average cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

If he misses 5 classes, he will attend 5 classes, and the average cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

Since $12 exceeds $10, he cannot miss 5 classes.

Thus, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss while still keeping the average cost per class at or below $10 is 4.

2. **Sales from Green Hats**: According to the problem, the sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \text{Sales from Green Hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from Red Hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800
   \]

3. **Total Sales in the First Month**: Now, we can calculate the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:
   \[
   \text{Total Sales in First Month} = \text{Sales from Red Hats} + \text{Sales from Green Hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200

3. **Expected Weekly Wage**: Sally's expected wage for the week is $300.
4. **No Other Deposits**: It is stated that she received no other money into her bank account this week.

Now, we can calculate how much money Sally has gained in her bank account over the week:

\[
\text{Change in Bank Account} = \text{Final Balance} - \text{Initial Balance} = 420 - 200 = 220
\]

This means that Sally's bank account increased by $220 during the week. 

Next, we know that her expected wage is $300. Therefore, the amount that should have been deposited into her account from her wage is $300. However, since her account only increased by $220, we can find out how much was withheld from her wage by subtracting the actual increase from the expected wage:

\[
\text{Withheld Amount} = \text{Expected Wage} - \text{Change in Bank Account} = 300 - 220 = 80

From the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

2. The total number of legs is:

Now we have a system of equations to solve. We can start with the first equation to express \( G \) in terms of \( S \):
\[
G = 20 - S
\]

Next, we can substitute this expression for \( G \) into the second equation:

Now, simplify this equation:

1. Calculate the total amount of candy:
   - Robert has 3 pounds.
   - Cindy has 5 pounds.
   - Aaron has 4 pounds.

   Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds.

2. Next, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it:
   - There are 3 people (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron).

   Amount of candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
   Amount of candy per person = 12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds.

Thus, after pooling and sharing their candy equally, each person would have 4 pounds of candy.

1. **Convert the current height from feet to inches:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is currently 20 feet tall.
   - Therefore, the height in inches is:
     \[
     20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Determine the target height:**
   - We want to find out when the bamboo will reach 600 inches.

3. **Calculate the height increase needed:**
   - The increase in height needed is:
     \[
     600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of days required for this growth:**
   - The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.
   - To find the number of days required to grow 360 inches, we divide the total increase needed by the daily growth rate:
     \[
     \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}

1. **Initial Situation**: James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he currently has enough toys for the dogs he has.

2. **New Dogs**: There are 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, the total number of dogs now is:
   \[
   4 \text{ (existing dogs)} + 8 \text{ (new dogs)} = 12 \text{ dogs}
   \]
   Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys in total.

3. **Buying Toys**: James needs to buy toys to cover the 12 dogs. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy:
   \[
   12 \text{ (total needed)} - 4 \text{ (toys on hand)} = 8 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Twice as Many More Dogs**: After buying the toys, James goes back and finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 8 new dogs added, so ""twice as many more"" means:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ more dogs}
   \]
   Adding these to the original 12 dogs gives:
   \[
   12 \text{ (existing dogs)} + 16 \text{ (new dogs)} = 28 \text{ dogs}
   \]
   Now, James needs 28 toys for 28 dogs.

5. **Toys Needed After Buying More**: James had already bought 8 toys, so now he needs to buy:
   \[
   28 \text{ (total needed)} - 4 \text{ (toys on hand)} = 24 \text{ toys}

6. **Dogs Gone**: When James comes back again, he finds that 3 dogs are gone. Therefore, the number of dogs now is:
   \[
   28 \text{ (previous total)} - 3 \text{ (dogs gone)} = 25 \text{ dogs}

   Now, he needs toys for 25 dogs.

7. **Final Calculation of Toys Needed**: Since he has 4 toys on hand, he now needs:
   \[
   25 \text{ (total needed)} - 4 \text{ (toys on hand)} = 21 \text{ toys}

- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( K = M - 5 \) (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
2. \( M = C + 12 \) (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
3. \( S = M + 23 \) (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)

We are given that \( K = 68 \). 

Using the first equation, we can find \( M \):

\[
68 = M - 5

\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( C \) using the second equation:

From the problem, we know the following:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's assume \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of all the children is 44, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]

Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are twins, we can say \( T_1 = T_2 \). Let's denote the age of each twin as \( T \). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
T + T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
\]
or
\[
2T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44

Since there are triplets, we can assume that \( R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R \). Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

\]

Now, substituting \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \) into our notation gives us:

T = R + 7

Now we can substitute \( T \) in the equation \( 2T + 3R = 44 \):

Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for a total of $3.20. We know that each lollipop costs $0.40. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[
\text{Cost of 5 lollipops} = 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00
\]

Now, we can find the total cost of the candies by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:
\[
\text{Cost of 4 candies} = 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20
\]

Next, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[
\text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30
\]

Now that we know the cost of one candy is $0.30, we can calculate the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies.

First, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[
\text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[
\text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00
\]

Finally, we add the costs of the lollipops and candies together to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00

1. **Rong's Savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.
   - In ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
   - Therefore, the total amount Rong saves in ten years is:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]

2. **Neil's Savings:**
   - Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. This means we first need to calculate how many coins Neil saves per month.
   - Since Rong saves 20 coins, we calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 20:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins}
     \]
   - Therefore, Neil saves:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins/month}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate how much Neil saves in ten years:
     \[
     28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}

3. **Total Savings After Ten Years:**
   - Now we can find the total number of coins they have together after ten years:
     \[
     2400 \text{ coins (Rong)} + 3360 \text{ coins (Neil)} = 5760 \text{ coins}

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   John needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20.
   \[
   \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Let \( x \) be the total bill.** According to the problem, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Therefore, we can express the cost of the heartworm check as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6x
   \]

3. **The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:**
   \[
   x = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. **Now, we can solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars}

1. **Price of an apple**: 
   - Given that one apple costs $0.5, we have:
     \[
     \text{Price of an apple} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Price of a banana**: 
   - It is stated that one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Price of a banana} = 2 \times \text{Price of an apple} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0
     \]

3. **Price of an orange**: 
   - It is mentioned that oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana. Thus:
     \[
     \text{Price of an orange} = 3 \times \text{Price of a banana} = 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0
     \]

Now that we have the prices of each fruit, we can calculate the total price of one crate, which consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.

4. **Total price of the crate**:
   - The total price can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total price} = (\text{Number of bananas} \times \text{Price of a banana}) + (\text{Number of apples} \times \text{Price of an apple}) + (\text{Number of oranges} \times \text{Price of an orange})
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total price} = (5 \times 1.0) + (12 \times 0.5) + (7 \times 3.0)
     \]
   - Calculating each term:
     \[
     5 \times 1.0 = 5.0
     \]
     \[
     12 \times 0.5 = 6.0
     \]
     \[
     7 \times 3.0 = 21.0

1. **Red Squares**: Brittany has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares**: The problem states that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: Next, it says there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Thus, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares**: Finally, it mentions that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we can find the total number of squares in the comforter by adding all the squares together:
\[
\text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12

We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. The speed of the cat is given as 15 feet/second. We can set up the following equation to find the speed of the turtle (let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( v_t \)):

\[
v_c = 5 \cdot v_t

1. **Determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City**: Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of that water used for industrial purposes**: Out of the 40% that Colorado City uses, 80% is for industrial purposes. 

   To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Industrial water usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\%

So, we convert 8 feet to inches:
8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches

Now, we add the additional 4 inches:
Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Next, we know from the problem statement that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically. Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem:

1. **Calculate the total number of students' cars' windows:**
   - There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
   - Total windows from students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

2. **Calculate the total number of teachers' cars' windows:**
   - There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
   - Total windows from teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

3. **Calculate the total number of windows smashed:**
   - Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
     - Windows smashed from students' cars = 1/4 * 256 = 64 windows.
   - Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows:
     - Windows smashed from teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 = 48 windows.

4. **Add the total windows smashed:**
   - Total windows smashed = Windows smashed from students' cars + Windows smashed from teachers' cars

   \[
   \text{Father's Age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's Age} + 8
   \]
   Substituting Dora's age:
   \[
   \text{Father's Age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

3. **Dora's Mother's Age**: The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Mother's Age} = \text{Father's Age} - 4
   \]
   Substituting the father's age we just calculated:
   \[
   \text{Mother's Age} = 38 - 4 = 34

2. **French Book**: The French book weighs 4 pounds.

3. **English Book**: The English book weighs 3 pounds.

   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we can sum up the weights of all the books:

- Weight of math and science books: \( 2n \)
- Weight of the French book: \( 4 \)
- Weight of the English book: \( 3 \)
- Weight of the history book: \( 6 \)

The total weight of all the books is:

Since we do not have a specific value for \( n \) (the number of math and science books), we cannot calculate a numerical total weight without that information. However, the expression \( 2n + 13 \) represents the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying.

If we assume \( n = 0 \) (meaning she has no math and science books), the total weight would be:

747,"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching vendors, we first need to calculate the cost of tomatoes from both vendors for one day and then for a week.

1. **Calculate the daily cost with the old vendor:**
   - Cost per tomato from the old vendor = $0.5
   - Number of tomatoes sold per day = 500
   - Daily cost with the old vendor = Cost per tomato × Number of tomatoes
   \[
   \text{Daily cost (old vendor)} = 0.5 \times 500 = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily cost with the new vendor:**
   - Cost per tomato from the new vendor = $0.4
   - Daily cost with the new vendor = Cost per tomato × Number of tomatoes
   \[
   \text{Daily cost (new vendor)} = 0.4 \times 500 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   - Daily savings = Daily cost (old vendor) - Daily cost (new vendor)
   \[
   \text{Daily savings} = 250 - 200 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings = Daily savings × 7
   \[
   \text{Weekly savings} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the vendor saves in a week is:

1. **Determine the number of weeks in two 4-week months:**
   - Two 4-week months equal 8 weeks.

2. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends in 8 weeks:**
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - In 8 weeks:
     - Weekdays: \( 8 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 40 \text{ weekdays} \)
     - Weekends: \( 8 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 16 \text{ weekend days} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays:**
   - Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday.
   - Total chairs rented on weekdays: \( 40 \text{ weekdays} \times 60 \text{ chairs/weekday} = 2400 \text{ chairs} \)

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Lorraine starts with:
     - 30 small stickers
     - 40 large stickers

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - The value of 27 small stickers in terms of large buttons:
     - Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons, 27 small stickers can be traded for:
       - 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons (since 1 small sticker = 1 small button).
       - To convert small buttons to large buttons, we know that 1 large button = 3 small buttons.
       - Therefore, 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Small stickers left: 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers
     - Large stickers: 40
     - Large buttons: 9

3. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - The value of 20 large stickers in terms of large buttons:
     - Since 1 large sticker = 1 large button, 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Small stickers: 3
     - Large stickers left: 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers
     - Large buttons: 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - The value of 20 large stickers in terms of small buttons:
     - Since 1 large button = 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has:
     - Small stickers: 3 + 60 = 63 small stickers

768,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Ezra's Reading**: We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour.
2. **Ahmed's Reading**: According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that same hour. Therefore, if we let the number of books Ahmed read be \( x \), we have:
   \[
   300 = 2x
   \]
   To find \( x \), we can solve for it:
   \[
   x = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   So, Ahmed read 150 books in that hour.

3. **Total Books Read in One Hour**: Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed in that hour:
   \[
   \text{Total books read in one hour} = \text{Books read by Ezra} + \text{Books read by Ahmed} = 300 + 150 = 450
   \]

4. **Ezra's Additional Reading**: Ezra decided to read 150 more books after the initial hour. We need to add this to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total books read by Ezra} = 300 + 150 = 450
   \]

5. **Final Total**: Now, we can find the overall total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:
   \[
   \text{Total books read altogether} = \text{Total books read by Ezra} + \text{Total books read by Ahmed} = 450 + 150 = 600
   \]

Thus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is:

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, her earnings are:
  \[
  5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Since she taught more than 3 classes (4 classes), she also earns an additional $5 for the day:

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B + 3 \) berries. 

The scores for Ava and Emma can be calculated as follows:

1. **Emma's Score**:
   - Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5B \)
   - Points from time: \( 30T \) (where \( T \) is the time left for Emma)

   Therefore, Emma's total score \( S_E \) is:
   \[
   S_E = 10E + 5B + 30T

2. **Ava's Score**:
   - Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
   - Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
   - Points from time: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) (since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower)

   Therefore, Ava's total score \( S_A \) is:

After buying more fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, which gives us another equation:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's simplify the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y

\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can use the second equation:

\[
x + y = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

We can solve Equation 2 for \( x \):

\[
x = 17 - y

Now we can substitute \( x \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5

1. **Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:**
   - One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs.
   - So, the number of smart TVs sold is:
     \[
     \text{Smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:**
   - One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs.
   - So, the number of analog TVs sold is:
     \[
     \text{Analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5

\text{Nighttime temperature} = \text{Daytime temperature} - \text{Temperature drop}
\]
\[
\text{Nighttime temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}

1. **Regular Hours**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
2. **Overtime Hours**: Any hours worked beyond 8 hours are considered overtime. Jamie's overtime pay is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the first 8 hours:

\[
\text{Regular Pay} = \text{Regular Hourly Rate} \times \text{Regular Hours} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 160 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how many hours she worked beyond the regular 8 hours. Jamie worked a total of 11 hours, so the overtime hours are:

\[
\text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours Worked} - \text{Regular Hours} = 11 \, \text{hours} - 8 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, we calculate her overtime pay. The overtime rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate:

\[
\text{Overtime Rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Regular Hourly Rate} = 1.5 \times 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour}
\]

Now we can calculate her pay for the overtime hours:

\[
\text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Rate} \times \text{Overtime Hours} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total pay for the day:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = \text{Regular Pay} + \text{Overtime Pay} = 160 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars}

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Calculating the total number of stuffed animals:

\[
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14
\]

Let \( g \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy. After buying \( g \) stuffed goats, the new total number of stuffed animals will be:

\[
14 + g
\]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
g = 0.3 \times (14 + g)
\]

Now, we can solve this equation for \( g \).

First, distribute the 0.3:

\[
g = 0.3 \times 14 + 0.3g
\]

Calculating \( 0.3 \times 14 \):

\[
0.3 \times 14 = 4.2
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation gives:

\[
g = 4.2 + 0.3g
\]

Next, we can isolate \( g \) by subtracting \( 0.3g \) from both sides:

\[
g - 0.3g = 4.2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0.7g = 4.2
\]

Now, divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for \( g \):

g = \frac{4.2}{0.7} = 6

Thus, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

806,"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed the test and the total number of students who took the test.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Total third graders = 500
   - Passed third graders = 340
   - Pass rate for third graders = 340 / 500 = 0.68 or 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Total fourth graders = 100
   - Passed fourth graders = 40
   - Pass rate for fourth graders = 40 / 100 = 0.40 or 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Total fifth graders = 400
   - The pass rate for fifth graders is twice that of the fourth graders. Since the fourth graders' pass rate is 0.40, the fifth graders' pass rate is:
     - Fifth graders' pass rate = 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 or 80%
   - Therefore, the number of fifth graders who passed = 80% of 400 = 0.80 * 400 = 320.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

- **Total Students:**
  - Third graders: 500
  - Fourth graders: 100
  - Fifth graders: 400
  - Total students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

- **Total Passed:**
  - Passed third graders: 340
  - Passed fourth graders: 40
  - Passed fifth graders: 320
  - Total passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total Passed}}{\text{Total Students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70
\]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.70 \times 100 = 70\%
\]

Thus, the overall pass rate for the school is 70%.

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips:**
   Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips. Therefore, the total number of chips is:
   \[
   2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips/bag} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made:**
   Since it takes 12 glass chips to cover 1 square inch of the mosaic, we can find out how many square inches can be covered with 144 chips:
   \[
   \text{Square inches} = \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}

3. **Calculate the length of the mosaic:**
   The mosaic is 3 inches tall. To find the length, we can use the area of the mosaic (which is the number of square inches) and the height:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Rearranging this gives us:
   \[

Felix charges $0.25 per branch. To find the total number of branches he climbed to earn $105, we can use the following calculation:

Total earnings = Number of branches climbed × Charge per branch

Let \( x \) be the number of branches climbed. We can set up the equation:

\[ 
105 = x \times 0.25 
\]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.25:

\[ 
x = \frac{105}{0.25} 
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[ 
x = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420 
\]

So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

\[ 
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7}

     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the second type: 4 flowers with 6 petals each.

3. **Calculating the number of flowers dropped:**
   Rose drops 1 flower of each type:

1. **Initial number of marshmallows**: 35 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9 S'mores, which means he used 9 marshmallows.
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9 S'mores, which means he used 9 marshmallows as well.
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3 marshmallows.

Now, we can calculate the total number of marshmallows used and lost:

- Total marshmallows used by both John and DeSean: 
  \[
  9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows}
  \]

- Total marshmallows lost (dropped): 
  \[
  3 \text{ marshmallows}
  \]

Next, we find the total marshmallows that have been used or lost:

\[
18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows}
\]

Now, we subtract the total marshmallows used and lost from the initial number of marshmallows:

\[
35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows left}

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the remaining marshmallows can be used to make S'mores. 

Thus, the total number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is:

\[
14 \text{ S'mores}
\]

Since both John and DeSean can share these marshmallows equally, we can divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

1. **Jack's Playtime:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, we can find out how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, Jack uses 12 quarters.

2. **Friend 1's Playtime (significantly worse):**
   - This friend can only play half as long as Jack, which means they can play for:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), the number of 10-minute intervals is:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, Friend 1 uses 24 quarters.

3. **Friend 2's Playtime (also significantly worse):**
   - This friend has the same playtime as Friend 1, so they also play for 10 minutes per quarter.
   - Thus, Friend 2 also uses 24 quarters.

4. **Friend 3's Playtime (significantly better):**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which means they can play for:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), the number of 30-minute intervals is:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( z = f \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
z + f + s + g + o = 10
\]

Now, substituting the relationships into the total:

Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \):

\[
z + z + s + s + o = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2z + 2s + o = 10
\]

Now, since \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( s \) in the equation:

\[
2z + 2(2z) + o = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2z + 4z + o = 10
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
6z + o = 10
\]

Now, substituting \( o = 2s \) into the equation. Since \( s = 2z \), we have:

\[
o = 2(2z) = 4z
\]

Now we can substitute \( o \) back into the equation:

\[
6z + 4z = 10

This simplifies to:

\[
10z = 10

Dividing both sides by 10 gives:

- Fragrance \( f = 1 \) ounce
- Salt \( s = 2 \) ounces
- Sugar \( g = 2 \) ounces

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. Therefore, Julie's score can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10
   \]

3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since we already calculated Julie's score in the first game to be 10 points, we can find Sasha's score in the second game:
   \[
   \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \).
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \).

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341
\]

Now, simplify the left side:

\[
x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341
\]
\[
7x + 12 = 341
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[
7x = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7x = 329
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{329}{7}
\]
\[
x = 47
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( x = 47 \).
- Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \).
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \).

   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times \text{Green eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:

4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Pink eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we can find the total number of eggs by adding all the eggs together:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = \text{Green eggs} + \text{Blue eggs} + \text{Pink eggs} + \text{Yellow eggs}

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight: \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.4 \text{ dollars} \)
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance: \( 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.6 \text{ dollars} \)
   - Total shipping cost: \( 1.4 \text{ dollars} + 1.6 \text{ dollars} = 3.0 \text{ dollars} \)

2. **Calculate the refund from Amazon:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Refund amount: \( 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \)

   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent on videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - For a month (4 weeks), the total time spent on videos = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs**:
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - For a month, the total time spent writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup**:
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.

The base installation includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

Now, let's calculate how many additional items Angela has:

1. **Mirrors**: 
   - Angela has 6 mirrors, but the installation includes 4 mirrors.
   - Additional mirrors = 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors.

2. **Chandeliers**: 
   - Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the installation includes 1 chandelier.
   - Additional chandeliers = 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.

3. **Pictures**: 
   - Angela has 20 pictures, but the installation includes 10 pictures.
   - Additional pictures = 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

Now, we sum the additional items:
- Additional items = 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 additional items.

The cost for the base installation is $129.00. The cost for the additional items is calculated as follows:
- Additional cost = 13 items × $15.00/item = $195.00.

Finally, we add the base installation cost to the additional cost:
- Total cost = Base installation cost + Additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

     \]

3. **Kagiyami's lifting ability**: 
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Since Saskay can lift 12 inches, Kagiyami can lift:

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - The total time taken by the kangaroos is 18 hours, which means the distance they cover can be represented as:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo. The combined speed of 3 kangaroos is \( 3v \).
   - Therefore, the distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18
     \]
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).
   - The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance:**
   - We need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cover the distance \( D \):
     \[
     D = 2v \times t
     \]
   - We already know that \( D = 54v \), so we can set the equations equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2v \times t
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by \( v \) (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):

1. **Understanding Jack's Dishes**: 
   - We know that Jack collected 60 dishes.

2. **Finding Jack's Socks**:
   - According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. 
   - Let \( S_J \) be the number of socks Jack has. 
   - Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, we can write the equation:
     \[
     2S_J = 60
     \]
   - Solving for \( S_J \):
     \[
     S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - So, Jack has 30 socks.

3. **Finding Peter's Socks**:
   - The problem states that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. 
   - Therefore, if Jack has 30 socks, Peter has:
     \[
     S_P = 2 \times S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]
   - So, Peter has 60 socks.

4. **Finding Peter's Dishes**:
   - The problem also states that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. 
   - Let \( D_J \) be the number of dishes Jack has (which we know is 60).
   - Therefore, Peter has:
     \[
     D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times D_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
     \]
   - So, Peter has 30 dishes.

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   - Now we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
     - Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = \( S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90 \)
     - Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = \( D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90 \)
   - Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes together is:
     \[

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( I \) is the interest earned.

The interest \( I \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
I = P \times r \times t

where:
- \( r \) is the interest rate per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:

- \( r = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \) (the interest rate per year),
- \( t = 3 \) (the number of years).

   - Total white shirts = 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars = Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Calculate the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts = 50

2. **Goats sold:**
   - From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
   - From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he sold from Farm X. Therefore, he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year as follows:

\[
\text{Total pairs per year} = \text{Pairs per month} \times \text{Months per year} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pairs}

Next, we know that James spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:

\[
\text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total pairs bought}} = \frac{2640}{24}

Let's denote:
- \( g \) as the number of green baskets,
- \( r \) as the number of red baskets.

We know that:
1. \( g + r = 3 \) (the total number of baskets),
2. The cost of each green basket is $25,
3. The cost of each red basket is $18, but we get a discount of $2 for each red basket.

The effective cost of each red basket after the discount is:
\[
18 - 2 = 16
\]

Now, the total cost \( C \) can be expressed as:
\[
C = 25g + 16r
\]

Since \( g + r = 3 \), we can express \( g \) in terms of \( r \):
\[
g = 3 - r
\]

Substituting \( g \) into the cost equation gives:
\[
C = 25(3 - r) + 16r
\]
\[
C = 75 - 25r + 16r
\]
\[
C = 75 - 9r
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for different values of \( r \) (the number of red baskets):

1. If \( r = 0 \) (0 red baskets, 3 green baskets):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(0) = 75
   \]

2. If \( r = 1 \) (1 red basket, 2 green baskets):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(1) = 66
   \]

3. If \( r = 2 \) (2 red baskets, 1 green basket):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(2) = 57
   \]

4. If \( r = 3 \) (3 red baskets, 0 green baskets):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(3) = 48
   \]

Thus, the total cost varies depending on how many red and green baskets are purchased. The possible total costs are $75, $66, $57, and $48.

Since the problem does not specify how many of each type of basket to buy, we can conclude that the total cost will depend on the combination chosen. However, the minimum total cost occurs when all baskets are red.

1. **Calculate the total baking time**: 
   Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. This is a total of 5 hours (from 1 PM to 2 PM is 1 hour, and so on until 6 PM).

2. **Calculate the total number of loaves baked**: 
   Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours, she will bake:
   \[
   2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of slices**: 
   Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
   \[
   10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the slices**: 
   Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
   \[
   80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount raised by Paige from selling the banana bread slices is:

\[
G = S + 30
\]

The problem also states that if she had 70 gold coins, we can set \( G = 70 \). Now we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[
70 = S + 30
\]

To find the number of silver coins \( S \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
S = 70 - 30
\]
\[
S = 40
\]

Now we know that Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to calculate the number of gold coins using the earlier equation:

\[
G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
\]

Now we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of silver coins and gold coins together:

\[

   \[
   50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos}

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The number of red cars \( R = 12 \).
2. The number of green cars \( G \) is 2 fewer than the number of red cars:
   \[
   G = R - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10.
   \]
3. The number of blue cars \( B \) is 3 times the number of green cars:
   \[
   B = 3G = 3 \times 10 = 30.
   \]
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75:
   \[
   R + G + B + Y = 75.

\[
s = a + 25
\]

It is also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Therefore, we can express the number of books Fawn has as:

\[
f = a + 12
\]

Now, we know that the total number of books they have together is 85. This gives us the equation:

\[
s + a + f = 85
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( s \) and \( f \) into this equation, we get:

\[
(a + 25) + a + (a + 12) = 85
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
3a + 37 = 85

Next, we will isolate \( a \) by subtracting 37 from both sides:

\[
3a = 85 - 37

\[
3a = 48
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{48}{3} = 16

Now that we have the number of books Anne has, we can find the number of books Sofie and Fawn have. 

First, we calculate Sofie's books:

\]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Her present age is 8, so we want to find \( y \) such that:

\[
x + y = 3x
\]

Substituting \( x = 8 \) into the equation gives:

\[
8 + y = 3 \times 8
\]
\[
8 + y = 24

Now, we can solve for \( y \):

\[
y = 24 - 8

882,"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon**: 
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken**: 
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. 
   - Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of strawberries**: 
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. 
   - Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of apples**: 
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. 
   - Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**: 
   - Now we can sum up the costs of all the items:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}

     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating the remaining budget**: 
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}

According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, which means the main part of the final concert lasts \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, there is a 15-minute encore at the end of the concert.

The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

- The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is \( 11v \).
- We know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second.

From this information, we can set up the equation:

According to the problem:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we need to calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns. 

Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so from Joe, she earned:
\[
\text{Earnings from Joe} = 6
\]

Next, we need to determine how much she earned from Kamala and Alba. We don't have the payment amounts for Kamala and Alba, but we can express them in terms of \( x \).

Let's assume Tasha charges \( p \) dollars for each lawn she mows. Then:
- Earnings from Kamala would be \( 3x \cdot p \)
- Earnings from Alba would be \( 5x \cdot p \)

Thus, the total earnings from mowing lawns can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6 + 3xp + 5xp = 6 + 8xp
\]

Now, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\text{Earnings from lemonade} + \text{Total earnings from mowing} = 80
\]
Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Then we have:
\[
L + (6 + 8xp) = 80
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
L + 6 + 8xp = 80
\]
Subtracting 6 from both sides gives:
\[
L + 8xp = 74
\]
Thus, we can express \( L \) as:
\[
L = 74 - 8xp
\]

To find \( L \), we need to know \( xp \). However, we don't have specific values for \( x \) or \( p \). 

Since we are not given any additional information about how much Tasha charges for mowing lawns or how many times she mowed Joe's lawn, we can assume that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a reasonable amount that allows \( L \) to be non-negative.

If we assume \( x = 1 \) (meaning she mowed Joe's lawn once), then:
- Earnings from Joe = $6
- Earnings from Kamala = \( 3 \cdot p \)
- Earnings from Alba = \( 5 \cdot p \)

This gives:
\[
L = 74 - 8(1)p = 74 - 8p
\]

If we assume \( p = 1 \) (for simplicity), then:
\[
L = 74 - 8(1) = 66
\]

This means Tasha made $66 from lemonade sales. 

However, we can also check for other values of \( x \) and \( p \) to see if they yield a different result. But since we are looking for a reasonable solution, we can conclude that:

Tasha made $66 from lemonade sales.

Thus, the final result is \boxed{66}.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. **Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask}
     \]
   - For 20 small masks, the total material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask}
     \]
   - For 8 large masks, the total material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - Now, we add the material needed for both small and large masks:
     \[
     \text{Total material} = \text{Material for small masks} + \text{Material for large masks} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}

Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times. Therefore, the total number of tickets she bought is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total tickets} = \text{Number of movies} \times \text{Number of times seen each movie}
\]
\[
\text{Total tickets} = 9 \times 3 = 27
\]

Next, we know that Deepa spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[
\text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total tickets}}
\]
\[
\text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27}

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps. Since he sleeps for 10 hours, he works:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Walking his dog**: He spends 1 hour each day walking his dog.

Now, we can add up the total time he spends on these activities:
\[
\text{Total time spent} = \text{Sleeping} + \text{Working} + \text{Walking the dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent} = 10 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 19 \text{ hours}

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can find Harold's free time by subtracting the total time spent from 24 hours:
\[
\text{Free time} = 24 \text{ hours} - \text{Total time spent}

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This gives us the equation:

\[
D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
\]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:

\[
52 = 2(A - 4)

1. **Initial Budget**: Colby starts with $150.

2. **Expenses**:
   - **Movies on Fridays/Saturdays**: He saw 5 movies at $10 each.
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Movies on Other Days**: He saw 8 movies at $7 each.
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Popcorn**: He had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each.
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Candy**: He had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each.
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Expenses**:
   Now we sum all his expenses:
   \[
   50 \text{ (movies on Fri/Sat)} + 56 \text{ (movies on other days)} + 16 \text{ (popcorn)} + 8 \text{ (candy)} = 130 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining Budget**:
   We subtract his total expenses from his initial budget:
   \[
   150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of a Movie and Snacks**:
   Since it is a Friday, the cost of a movie ticket is $10. Colby also wants to buy a popcorn for $8 and a box of candy for $2. The total cost for one movie along with popcorn and candy is:
   \[
   10 \text{ (movie)} + 8 \text{ (popcorn)} + 2 \text{ (candy)} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Number of Movies**:
   With $20 left, Colby can afford exactly one movie with popcorn and candy:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ dollars}}{20 \text{ dollars}} = 1 \text{ movie}
   \]

Thus, Colby can see 1 movie on the last day of the month.

1. **Monday**: Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. **Tuesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: She again removed twice as many as Monday, so:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78
   \]
4. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.
5. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we can sum these amounts to find the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  39 + 78 = 117

1. **Distance traveled by the bus**:
   The formula for distance is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   For the bus:
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Time = 5 hours

   So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance traveled by the car**:
   For the car:
   - Speed = 30 miles per hour
   - Time = 8 hours

   So, the distance traveled by the car is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}

3. **Finding the difference in distance**:
   Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles}

1. **Count the existing toys:**
   - Building blocks: 31
   - Stuffed animals: 8
   - Stacking rings: 9

   Now, we add these numbers together:

   \[
   31 + 8 + 9 = 48
   \]

2. **Total toys after adding bouncy balls:**
   Sophie states that after adding the bouncy balls, her total number of toys is 62. We can set up the equation:

   \[
   \text{Total toys} = \text{Existing toys} + \text{Bouncy balls}

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   62 = 48 + \text{Bouncy balls}
   \]

3. **Solve for the number of bouncy balls:**
   To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the number of existing toys from the total:

   \[
   \text{Bouncy balls} = 62 - 48 = 14

931,"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( A \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the second equation into the first and third equations.

Substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
P + 2J = 90
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
P = 90 - 2J \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have two equations for \( P \):
1. \( P = 90 - 2J \)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \)

Setting these two expressions for \( P \) equal to each other:
\[
90 - 2J = 2J + 10
\]
Adding \( 2J \) to both sides gives:
\[
90 = 4J + 10
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
80 = 4J
\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( A \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we can find \( P \):
Using Equation 2:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

1. **Service Charge**: There is a flat fee for visiting the house, which is $40.

2. **Labor Charge**: The labor charge is $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round this up to the nearest whole hour because they charge for any part of an hour. Therefore, 2.25 hours rounds up to 3 hours.

   Labor charge calculation:
   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}

945,"To determine how long it took James to swim across the lake, we can break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance he swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the total distance of the lake, which is 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. The time taken to swim 12 miles is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time for first part} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   After swimming, James rests for half the time it took him to swim the first part.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance after swimming 12 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed. His original speed is 2 miles per hour, so half of that is:
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]
   The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
   \[
   \text{Time for second part} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   The total time taken is the sum of the time for the first part, the resting time, and the time for the second part:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for first part} + \text{Resting time} + \text{Time for second part}

   - Price per copy: $5
   - Commission rate: 10%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the New York Times:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from New York Times} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Price per copy} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}

- Let \( D \) be Deanna's age.
- Let \( M \) be Marcus's age.
- Let \( L \) be Leo's age.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Deanna's age \( D = 26 \).
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can express Marcus's age as:
   \[
   M = D - 5
   \]
   Substituting Deanna's age:
   \[
   M = 26 - 5 = 21
   \]

3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   M = \frac{1}{2} L
   \]
   Substituting Marcus's age:
   \[
   21 = \frac{1}{2} L

   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) back into the total points equation:

\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45

Adding 30 to both sides:

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

Using \( A = B - 20 \):

- Azibo scored \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar scored \( D = 15 \)

To confirm, we check the total:

\[
A = 70
\]
\[
L = 70
\]

Let \( C \) be the number of corn chips that Collins received. According to the problem, Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey. Therefore, we can express Collins' amount as:

\[
C = A + 15
\]

Substituting the value of \( A \):

\[
C = 70 + 15 = 85
\]

Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[
\text{Total} = A + L + C = 70 + 70 + 85

1. **Cost of Supplies**: Jen pays $400 for supplies.

2. **Cost of Travel Tickets**: The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find 50% of the supplies cost, we calculate:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200

963,"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Next, we can substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation. We have:
\[
D = \frac{334 - 2S}{1}
\]

Now, substituting \( S = 4D - 13 \) into \( 2S + D = 334 \):
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides results in:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing both sides by 9 gives:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can verify:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can express the total number of episodes in terms of the minutes per episode:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \times 20

Calculating this gives:

\[
E = \frac{20}{2} = 10

1. **First Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second Segment (North)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we will calculate the net distance traveled south:

  = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

- Distance traveled north = Distance from the second segment
  = 36 miles

Now, we find the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

3. **Sister's Age**: Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we first calculate 25% of Nani's age:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}

1. **Convert the flower bed length to inches**: Since the width of the flowers is given in inches, we should convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the space each plant occupies**: Each flower is 12 inches wide, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant, including the space between them, is:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches}

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine that Bill's dad will see the comet again when he is \( D + 75 \) years old. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's denote Bill's age when he first saw the comet as \( B \).

The problem states that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet, we can express the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time as:

\[
\text{Age of Bill when he saw the comet second time} = 3 \times 30 = 90
\]

Now, we know that Bill's dad will see the comet again when he is \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old. 

The time that passes between the first and second sightings of the comet for Bill is the same as the time that passes for his dad, which is 75 years. Therefore, we can express Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time as:

\[
B + 75 = 90

The remaining flights, which are not to Greece, amount to:

We know that the total age of the children is 20 years, which gives us the equation:

Substituting the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro:

999,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the 2 adults and 4 kids, given that each adult receives a slice that is twice as large as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x
\]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as a kid's slice, so each adult's slice is:

\[
2x
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\[
2 \times 2x = 4x
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total size of the slices for the adults and the kids:

\[
\text{Total size} = \text{Total size for adults} + \text{Total size for kids} = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

Next, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying this expression:

\[
\frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, converting this fraction to a percentage:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

1. **Total time available**: Doctor Jones has 9 hours at the clinic.

2. **Time spent on rounds**: 
   - He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.
   - Total time for rounds = Number of inpatients × Time per inpatient
   \[
   \text{Total time for rounds} = 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time spent on appointments**:
   - He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = Number of appointments × Time per appointment
   \[
   \text{Total time for appointments} = 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}

1. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes
2. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
3. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:

- Time to make the batter: 20 minutes
- Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
- Time to cool the cake: 120 minutes
- Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes

Calculating this step-by-step:

- 20 + 30 = 50 minutes

V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft}

15 \times 60 = 900
\]

So, there are 900 pieces of sweets in total.

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. We need to find out how many packs she gave away. The number of packs she gave away is:

\[
\text{Packs given away} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} = 15 - 2 = 13
\]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in the 13 packs that she gave away. The number of pieces in 13 packs is:

\[
\text{Pieces given away} = \text{Packs given away} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 13 \times 60
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
13 \times 60 = 780
\]

Now, Anne distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[
\text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Pieces given away}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{780}{10}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{780}{10} = 78

1016,"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ P = P_0 (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years,
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.

In this case:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) (the initial price of carrots),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) (the number of years).

Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 (1.05)^3 \]

Next, we calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Finally, we round this to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

Thus, the price of carrots after three years will be:

Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
\]

Now, we know that Olivia has 3 albums that contain only selfies and 2 albums that contain only portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits.

1. **Selfies**: 
   - There are 3 albums of selfies.
   - Each album has 9 pictures.
   - Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) (since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal:

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher is present (which happens with a 50% chance), we need to consider two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension Given**: There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give everyone an extension. If this happens, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension Given**: There is a 60% chance that the teacher will not give an extension. In this case, we need to consider if Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework:
       - **Convincing the Teacher**: There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. If he convinces her, he does not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Not Convincing the Teacher**: There is an 80% chance that he cannot convince her, which means he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

1. **Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present**:
   - Probability of no extension given by the teacher: 60% (0.6)
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% (0.8)
   - Therefore, the probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present is:
     \[
     P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
     \]

2. **Overall probability of having to turn in homework**:
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% (0.5), which means no homework.
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% (0.5), and if she is present, the probability of having to turn in homework is 0.48 (as calculated above).
   - Therefore, the overall probability of having to turn in homework is:

Next, we calculate the total number of seats that are reserved for graduates and faculty:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} = 950 + 300 = 1250

1035,"To determine how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate how many bottles of soda he will place along the 24-foot wide driveway, given that he places a bottle every 3 feet.

1. **Calculate the number of bottles:**
   The number of bottles can be calculated by dividing the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Width of driveway}}{\text{Distance between bottles}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet}} = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the time taken to set off each fountain:**
   Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since he will be placing a bottle at the start and then moving to the next, he will only need to move between the first 7 bottles (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, until the 7th to the 8th).

   Therefore, the number of movements he makes is:
   \[
   \text{Number of movements} = \text{Number of bottles} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   The total time taken to set off all the fountains is the number of movements multiplied by the time taken for each movement:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Number of movements} \times \text{Time per movement} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{35}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans taken**:
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the income lost while in college**:
   Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. Since he was in college for 4 years, the total income he lost is:
   \[
   \text{Income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn back**:
   The total amount Jim needs to earn back is the sum of the loans and the income lost:
   \[
   \text{Total amount to earn back} = \text{Total loans} + \text{Income lost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
   \]

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college**:
   After college, Jim's income triples. Therefore, his new income is:
   \[
   \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the time it takes to earn back the total amount**:
   To find out how long it will take Jim to earn back the total amount of $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total amount to earn back}}{\text{New income}} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4

   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery**: 
   On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
   First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
   \[
   \text{One-fifth of Monday's delivery} = \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Now, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's delivery} = 85 + 17 = 102

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

1. Combine the terms:

   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**: 
   Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Assuming a full day is 8 hours, the hours worked each day is:

- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[

   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000.
2. **Depreciation Rate**: The car loses 21% of its value each year. This means that at the end of each year, the car retains 79% of its value (100% - 21% = 79%).

We can express the value of the car after each year using the formula:

\[
\text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n
\]

In this case, the depreciation rate is 0.21, so the retention rate is 0.79. We need to calculate the value after 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

3. **Calculation**:
   - For \( n = 3 \):
   \[
   \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3

1. **Calculate the area of one tile**: Since each tile is square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one tile} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tiles needed**: The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Since each tile covers 1 SqFt, the number of tiles required is:
   \[

1. **Calculate the increase in cost**: 
   The normal cost is $120. Since the cost is 60% more than normal, we calculate 60% of $120:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72

Greg has:
- 4 twin beds, which means he has 4 sets of twin sheets.
- 1 king size bed, which means he has 1 set of king sheets.

Each week, he washes:
- 4 twin sets of sheets
- 1 king set of sheets

Now, let's calculate the number of loads he needs to do for the twin sheets and the king sheets separately.

1. **Twin Sheets:**
   - He has 4 twin sets of sheets.
   - His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time.
   - Therefore, the number of loads for twin sheets is:
     \[
     \text{Loads for twin sheets} = \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

2. **King Sheets:**
   - He has 1 king set of sheets.
   - His laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time.
   - Therefore, the number of loads for king sheets is:
     \[
     \text{Loads for king sheets} = \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

Now, we can find the total number of loads he does in one week:
\[
\text{Total loads per week} = \text{Loads for twin sheets} + \text{Loads for king sheets} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ loads}

Next, we need to calculate how many weeks are in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of loads he does in a year:
\[

2. **Becky's Slices**: 
   We know from the problem that Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices**: 
   According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, if we let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate, we can write:
   \[
   B = J + 3
   \]
   Since we know Becky ate 10 slices:
   \[
   10 = J + 3
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]
   So, Jake ate 7 slices.

4. **Silvia's Slices**: 
   The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, if \( S \) represents the number of slices Silvia ate, we have:
   \[
   S = 2J
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 7 \):
   \[
   S = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]
   So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

5. **Total Slices Eaten**: 
   Now we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14

The total time for the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + (d + 18) = 98
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[

1. **Cost of the cast**: This is a fixed charge of $200.

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour. Since Hannah's visit lasts for 30 minutes, we need to convert that into hours. 
   - 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   300 \text{ (per hour)} \times 0.5 \text{ (hours)} = 150
   \]

3. **Cost of painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \text{ (per pill)} \times 30 \text{ (pills)} = 120

4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for parking, with a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the total cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \text{ (per hour)} \times 2 \text{ (hours)} = 12

   The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

2. **Calculate the daily banana consumption of the second monkey:**
   The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day.}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:**
   The total number of bananas consumed by the first and second monkeys each day is:
   \[
   10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly consumption of the first and second monkeys:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption for both monkeys is:
   \[
   24 \times 7 = 168 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the third monkey:**
   Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for the week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the third monkey over the week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

6. **Calculate the daily consumption of the third monkey:**
   To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas it consumes in a week by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas.}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

1. **Cost of Roses**:
   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for 15 roses is:
     \[
     15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Payment**:
   - Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
     \[
     5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Change Calculation**:
   - Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to pay for the roses. Therefore, she cannot buy the 15 roses.

Since Jenny cannot complete the purchase, she leaves with the same amount of money she arrived with, which is $25. 

4. **Quarters Calculation**:
   - To find out how many quarters are in $25, we convert dollars to quarters:
     \[
     25 \text{ dollars} \times 4 \text{ quarters/dollar} = 100 \text{ quarters}

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes (arrival) + 20 minutes (stay) = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the first train's stay: 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departure time: 60 minutes (arrival) + 5 minutes (stay) = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes.

Now, we can calculate how long Paul waits for the fourth train:
- Paul arrives at the station at time 0 and waits until the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes.

To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

\[
\text{Total toothpicks saved} = 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:

\[
\text{Toothpicks needed} = 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can calculate the number of weeks required by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[
\text{Weeks needed} = \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}

1. **Distance from home to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Walking speed**: 4 miles per hour.

When James walks to the store, he first walks halfway there. Half of 4 miles is 2 miles. 

3. **Time to walk halfway to the store**: 
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes).

After realizing he forgot something, he walks back home, which is another 2 miles.

4. **Time to walk back home**: 
   - Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes).

Now, he has walked a total of 4 miles (2 miles to the halfway point and 2 miles back home), which took him:

- Time to walk to halfway: 0.5 hours
- Time to walk back home: 0.5 hours

Total time spent walking = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

Since he did not reach the store, we need to calculate how long it would take him to reach the store from home if he continued walking after returning home. 

5. **Time to walk the remaining distance to the store**: 
   - After returning home, he still has 4 miles to walk to the store.
   - Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.

Now, we add the time he spent walking back and the time to reach the store:

Total time = Time to walk halfway + Time to walk back + Time to walk to the store
Total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Thus, the total time it took him to reach the store after realizing he forgot something is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of buying these 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[
\text{Cost of 40 bananas} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars/banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find out how much Jenny spent by buying the bananas in bunches. She bought 10 bunches at a cost of $3.00 per bunch:

   S + H = 100
   \]

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:
   \[
   H = S + 60
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( H \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
2S + 60 = 100

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides:
\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 20
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = S + 60 \):

     7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Therefore, the extra learning time for both days is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since this is for both Saturday and Sunday, he spends:
     \[
     \frac{630 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes} \text{ each day}

     1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 630 \text{ minutes} = 2230 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

6. **Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{2230 \text{ minutes}}{60} \approx 37.1667 \text{ hours}

1093,"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = width × height = 10 feet × 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls (north and south), the total area for these walls is:
     \[
     2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}.
     \]

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = width × height = 5 feet × 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two walls (east and west), the total area for these walls is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**
   - Total area = area of north and south walls + area of east and west walls:
     \[
     160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}.
     \]

4. **Determine how many gallons of paint are needed:**
   - Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - To find the number of gallons needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
     \[
     \text{Gallons needed} = \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}.
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Each gallon costs $12.
   - Total cost = number of gallons × cost per gallon:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars}.

1. **Initial Setup**: Ellen has a case of 12 sodas, out of which 3 are shaken and 9 are unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Action**: Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. After this, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: 3
   - Unshaken: 8 (since she took 1 from the original 9)

3. **Ellen's Brother's Action**: Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. After his actions, the remaining sodas are:
   - Shaken: 2 (3 original - 1 taken by brother)
   - Unshaken: 6 (8 original - 2 taken by brother)

4. **Total Remaining Sodas**: After both Ellen and her brother have taken sodas, there are a total of:
   - 2 shaken sodas
   - 6 unshaken sodas
   - Total remaining sodas = 2 + 6 = 8 sodas

5. **Calculating the Probability**: Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda. The probability \( P \) that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is given by the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of remaining sodas:
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}

- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Now, we sum the male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes = Male guppies + Male goldfishes = 4 + 3 = 7
- Total female fishes = Female guppies + Female goldfishes = 7 + 5 = 12

**Step 2: Calculate the number of fishes after Tate buys more.**

Tate buys:
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppy: 1

1. **Valerie's Earnings**: Valerie earns $5000 per month.

2. **Brother's Earnings**: According to the problem, Valerie earns half of what her brother earns. Therefore, if we let \( B \) represent her brother's earnings, we have:
   \[
   5000 = \frac{1}{2} B
   \]
   To find \( B \), we can multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   B = 5000 \times 2 = 10000
   \]
   So, Valerie's brother earns $10,000 per month.

3. **Combined Earnings of Valerie and Her Brother**: Now, we can calculate their combined earnings:
   \[
   \text{Combined Earnings} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000
   \]

4. **Mother's Earnings**: The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. Therefore, if we let \( M \) represent the mother's earnings, we have:
   \[
   M = 2 \times 15000 = 30000
   \]

5. **Total Amount of Money They All Have Together**: Now we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's earnings, her brother's earnings, and their mother's earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000

\[
\text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2}{v} \text{ hours}
\]

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. To convert this into hours, we have:

\[
40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Setting the two expressions for time on the beach equal gives us:

\[
\frac{2}{v} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

To solve for \( v \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot v \implies 6 = 2v \implies v = 3 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now, Grandma's speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk. She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours}

Now, we convert this time into minutes:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 60 = 10 \text{ minutes}

Finally, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

   - There are 3 trees, and each tree has 7 blue birds.
   - Total from these trees = 3 trees × 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds.

2. **Calculate the number of blue birds in the second set of trees:**

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

1137,"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we can use the concept of mixing temperatures.

Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug of water. We know the following:

1. The temperature of the first mug is 33 degrees.
2. Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.
3. The resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.

The total volume of water in the bottle after pouring is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The formula for the average temperature of the mixture can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Setting the average temperature to be at least 40 degrees, we have:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Now, we can multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
(4 \times 33) + T \geq 200
\]

Calculating \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132

Now substituting this back into the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200

To isolate \( T \), we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 200 - 132

Calculating the right side:

\[
T \geq 68

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make these 18 scoops. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Calculating the number of potatoes needed for 1 less than 3 scoops:

\[
3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
\]

Now, calculating how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops:

\[
6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}

This means that 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we can set up a proportion:

If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then for 1 scoop, we need:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{1 \text{ scoop}}

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(A) = 0.20
   \]

2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
   \[
   P(B) = 3 \times P(A) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets win. Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:
\[
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) = 0.20 \times 0.60
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12

- Let \( C \) be the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let \( J \) be the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let \( R \) be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells: 
   \[
   J = 27
   \]

2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos:
   \[
   J = C + 5
   \]
   Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation gives:
   \[
   27 = C + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey:
   \[
   C = 2R
   \]
   Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation gives:
   \[
   22 = 2R
   \]
   Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{22}{2} = 11

Now we have the number of seashells collected by each person:
- Carlos collected \( C = 22 \) seashells.
- Jim collected \( J = 27 \) seashells.
- Carrey collected \( R = 11 \) seashells.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells collected:
\[
\text{Total} = C + J + R = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60

   - Linus bought 2 devices last Monday at $20 each:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Monday} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He bought 4 devices last Tuesday at $20 each:
     \[

2. **Selling Price of Devices:**
   - Linus sells each device for twice the original price:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price per Device} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}

Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

Now, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:

Next, we know that after both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. We can calculate how much money Rissa has left:

\[
\text{Rissa's remaining amount} = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much money Rissa gave to her little sister. Since she started with $15 and is left with $12, the amount she gave away is:

\[
\text{Amount given by Rissa} = 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave away $3. Now we can find out how much money Ronnie has left after giving away $3:

\[
\text{Ronnie's remaining amount} = 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars}

1. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal: 
   \[
   r = w = p
   \]

2. Half of the mural is yellow paint. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, the amount of yellow paint is:
   \[
   \text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
   \[
   r + w + p + \text{Yellow paint} = 12
   \]

Substituting the known values into the equation, we have:
\[
r + r + r + 6 = 12
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3r + 6 = 12
\]

Next, we can isolate \( r \) by subtracting 6 from both sides:
\[
3r = 12 - 6
\]
\[
3r = 6
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{6}{3} = 2

2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   - Total clouds on Tuesday = 2 * 3 = 6

3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   - Total clouds on Wednesday = 2 * 6 = 12

4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.

To find the number of pods in the special box, we calculate 20% of 100:

\[
20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
\]

Now, we add this to the original 100 pods:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

So, the special size box contains 120 pods.

Next, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run with these 120 pods if each cycle uses 1 pod. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of cycles is equal to the number of pods:

\[
\text{Number of cycles} = 120
\]

Now, we need to determine the cost per cycle. The box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, so the cost per cycle is:

\[
\text{Cost per cycle} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
\]

This means each cycle costs $0.10. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[
\text{Number of cycles for } \$1 = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10

50 - 10 = 40
\]

Now, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

1. **Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Chalk used} = 45\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ inches} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day going forward:**
   The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. We need to calculate 20% of the remaining 2.75 inches:
   \[
   \text{Chalk used per day} = 20\% \text{ of } 2.75 \text{ inches} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk before it becomes less than 2 inches:**
   The teacher can continue using the chalk until it is less than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it takes to go from 2.75 inches to just below 2 inches.

   The amount of chalk he can use before reaching 2 inches is:
   \[
   \text{Chalk to use} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

   Now, we divide the total amount of chalk he can use (0.75 inches) by the amount he uses each day (0.55 inches):
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}
   \]

   Since he can only use chalk for whole days, he can use it for 1 full day before it becomes less than 2 inches.

5. **Final result:**
   After using the chalk for 1 day, he will have:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after 1 day} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 0.55 \text{ inches} = 2.20 \text{ inches}
   \]
   After another day, he will have:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk after 2 days} = 2.20 \text{ inches} - 0.55 \text{ inches} = 1.65 \text{ inches}

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can express these statements mathematically.

### From the first statement:
Colin's age in seven years will be \( C + 7 \). According to the problem, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times this future age:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

### From the second statement:
In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \), and according to the problem, this will be one third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W

### Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \)

### Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
Substituting \( W \) in the second equation gives:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} (5(C + 7))
\]
Simplifying the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]
Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]
Expanding both sides:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( C \):

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. We convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}
   \]
   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs**: We need to find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs at the net rate of \(\frac{1}{5}\) snowballs per minute. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs needed}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

1188,"To find Jim's current age, we first need to determine how old John was when Digimon was released. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it was released 20 years ago. 

If John is currently 28 years old, we can calculate his age at the time of the release:

\[
\text{John's age when Digimon was released} = 28 - 20 = 8
\]

According to the problem, when Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim. Let Jim's age at that time be \( x \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
8 = 2x
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

This means Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. To find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years since the release:

\[
\text{Jim's current age} = 4 + 20 = 24
\]

Thus, Jim is currently 24 years old.

   - At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.

3. **People entering after 10:00**: 
   - After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is:

\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
\]

Now, we need to determine the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. Therefore, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}

     \]
   - He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so 1/4 more is:

1207,"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kg
- Second tuna: 46 kg
- Third tuna: 26 kg

Now, we add these weights together:

Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg
Total weight = 128 kg

Next, we need to determine the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

Total earnings = Total weight × Price per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 kg × $0.50

Calculating this gives:

Total earnings = 64 dollars

Thus, Deandre will earn a total of 64 dollars after selling all the tunas.

Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at a price that is \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. 

To calculate the selling price, we multiply the purchase price by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Purchase Price} \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. First, calculate \( \frac{72}{8} \):
   \[
   \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

2. Now multiply by 11:
   \[
   9 \times 11 = 99
   \]

So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the purchase price from the selling price:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Purchase Price} = 99 - 72
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
99 - 72 = 27

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = (6 \times 6) \times 15 = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans:**
   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{effective}} \) for the jelly beans is:
   \[
   V_{\text{effective}} = V \times \text{packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.8 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the effective volume:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit is:
   \[
   N = \frac{V_{\text{effective}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

4. **Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red, estimated}} \) is:

2. **Second magazine**: This magazine sends 6 issues a year. So:
   \[
   1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues}

3. **Third magazine**: This magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine. Since the 6-issue magazine sends 6 issues, the third magazine sends:
   \[
   4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues}

- Let \( S \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.
- Let \( H \) be the number of paintings Shelley has.
- Let \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley:
   \[
   S = H - 12
   \]

2. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim:
   \[
   H = K + 8
   \]

3. We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings:
   \[
   S = 27
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) into the first equation:
\[
27 = H - 12
\]

To find \( H \), we can add 12 to both sides:
\[
H = 27 + 12 = 39
\]

Now that we have \( H \), we can use the second equation to find \( K \):
\[
39 = K + 8
\]

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:
\[
K = 39 - 8 = 31

Thus, Kim has 31 paintings.

1. **Calculate the price in December after the 80% increase.**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - An 80% increase means we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Now, we add this increase to the original price:

1. **Standard Lessons**: Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
   - Total from standard lessons = Number of lessons × Rate per lesson
   - Total from standard lessons = 4 lessons × $80/lesson = $320

2. **Veteran Lessons**: Charlie gives 2 lessons to a veteran. Since he reduces his rate by 25% for these lessons, we first need to calculate the reduced rate.
   - Reduced rate = Standard rate - (25% of Standard rate)
   - 25% of $80 = 0.25 × $80 = $20
   - Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60

   Now, we calculate the total from the veteran lessons:
   - Total from veteran lessons = Number of lessons × Reduced rate
   - Total from veteran lessons = 2 lessons × $60/lesson = $120

3. **Total Earnings**: Now we add the earnings from both types of lessons.

   - Weekly cost for pasta = $1.00

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese**: Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.
   - Weekly cost for cheddar cheese = $3.00

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese**: Bud spends twice the amount he spends on cheddar cheese for gruyere cheese.
   - Weekly cost for gruyere cheese = 2 × $3.00 = $6.00

4. **Total Weekly Cost**: Now, we can calculate the total cost for making macaroni and cheese each week by adding the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

1249,"To find the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Flashlights**:
   - There are 4 people in the house, and each person has one flashlight.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (people)} = 4 \text{ flashlights}
     \]

2. **Candles**:
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - For each room, there are 2 flashlights. However, we are interested in the candles.
   - Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
     \]
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
     \]
   - Now, we add the small and medium candles together:
     \[
     16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
     \]

3. **Total**:
   - Now we combine the total number of flashlights and candles:
     \[
     4 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 40 \text{ total items}
     \]

Thus, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 40.

1250,"To find out how many chips each person gets, we first need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has. He buys two bags of chips, and each bag contains 55 chips. 

So, we calculate the total number of chips as follows:

Total chips = Number of bags × Chips per bag
Total chips = 2 bags × 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Next, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets. There are five members in his family.

Chips per person = Total chips ÷ Number of family members
Chips per person = 110 chips ÷ 5 members = 22 chips

Thus, each person in Mitchell's family gets 22 chips.

1. **Old Varnish Drying Time:**
   - Drying time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time = 6 paintings × 7 minutes/painting = 42 minutes.

2. **New Varnish Drying Time:**
   - Drying time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes.

1256,"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we first need to break down the total distance he needs to travel and how that distance is divided between hopping on land and swimming in water.

The total distance Phineas needs to cover is 200 yards. Since half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distances as follows:

- Distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each segment:

1. **Time to hop on land:**
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Distance on land = 100 yards
   - Time on land = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Time to swim in water:**
   - Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
   - Distance in water = 100 yards
   - Time in water = \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

According to the problem, we know that:
- The main phone costs \( M = 20 \) dollars.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so we have the equation \( M = 2A \).

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation gives us:
\[
20 = 2A
\]
To find \( A \), we can solve for it:
\[
A = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Now we know that each additional phone costs \( 10 \) dollars. Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are four additional phones.

Now we can calculate the total cost of the phone plan:
- Cost of the main phone: \( 20 \) dollars
- Cost of the four additional phones: \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) dollars

Adding these together gives us the total cost:

1. **Count the blue blocks**: There are 4 blue blocks.
2. **Count the yellow blocks**: The problem states that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ yellow blocks}

1269,"To determine how far Elvis is from his house after his journey, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance he travels west and the distance he travels east.

1. **Distance traveled west**:
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
   - The distance can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - So, the distance traveled west is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Distance traveled east**:
   - After traveling west, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph.
   - The distance traveled east is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Net distance from the house**:
   - After traveling west and then east, we can find the net distance from his house by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
     \[
     \text{Net distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Thus, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house after completing his journey.

1. **Initial Value**: The boat was bought for $9000.

2. **First Year Depreciation**: The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * 9000 = $2700.
   - Value after the first year = Initial value - Depreciation amount = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**: The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year, but this time it is based on the value at the end of the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * 6300 = $1890.
   - Value after the second year = Value after first year - Depreciation amount = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**: The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, again based on the value at the end of the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * 4410 = $882.
   - Value after the third year = Value after second year - Depreciation amount = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

After calculating the depreciation for each year, the final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

1. **Red candies**: We know there are 54 red candies.

2. **Orange candies**: The problem states that there are twice the amount of orange candies as red candies. Therefore, the number of orange candies is:
   \[
   \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times \text{Red candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]

3. **Yellow candies**: The problem states that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. Therefore, the number of yellow candies is:
   \[
   \text{Yellow candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Red candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of candies accounted for so far:
\[
\text{Total candies accounted} = \text{Red candies} + \text{Orange candies} + \text{Yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

Next, we know that the total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of accounted candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
\[
\text{Pink candies} = \text{Total candies} - \text{Total candies accounted} = 232 - 189 = 43

1. **Hotel Cost**:
   - Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost per night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total Hotel Cost} = \text{Number of Nights} \times \text{Cost per Night} = 3 \times 80 = 240
     \]

2. **Bus Cost**:
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - 10% of $80 is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Cost per Bus Trip} = 0.10 \times 80 = 8
     \]
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total bus cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total Bus Cost} = \text{Number of Bus Trips} \times \text{Cost per Bus Trip} = 7 \times 8 = 56

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add the total hotel cost and the total bus cost to find the overall cost of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Hotel Cost} + \text{Total Bus Cost} = 240 + 56 = 296

   - There are 2 adult tickets (for the parents) and 1 child ticket (for the child).
   - The cost of an adult ticket is $12, so for 2 adults:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dollars}

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of the two children: 75 pounds each, so \( 75 \times 2 = 150 \) pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight:

\[
3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
\]

Next, we find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower:

\[
50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds}

Now, we add this amount to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to find the total number of seeds in the large sunflower:

\[
\text{Seeds in large sunflower} = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers:

   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts.
   - The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means:
     - The first T-shirt costs $8.
     - The second T-shirt costs 50% off the original price of $8, which is:

     \]

2. **Calculating the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so we first calculate the discount:
     \[
     0.4 \times 40 = 16

\[
\text{Total allowance} = 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. This means he is buying ice cream for a total of 4 people (Ryan + 3 friends). The cost of each ice cream cone is $1.25, so we calculate the total cost for the ice cream:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} \times 4 \text{ cones} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\text{Number of tickets} = \frac{13 \text{ dollars}}{6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket}} \approx 2
\]

To confirm, we can calculate how much money Ryan would spend if he buys 2 tickets:

\[
\text{Cost for 2 tickets} = 2 \text{ tickets} \times 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since he has exactly $13 left, he can buy 2 tickets. If he tried to buy 3 tickets, the cost would be:

\[
\text{Cost for 3 tickets} = 3 \text{ tickets} \times 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 19.50 \text{ dollars}

Now, we can find the total number of eggs in both baskets by adding the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
Total number of eggs = 10 + 20 = 30 eggs

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30.

1. **Alexandra's amount**: 
   - Alexandra raises $430.

2. **Kim's amount**: 
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. 
   - Therefore, Kim's amount is:
     \[
     430 + 320 = 750
     \]

3. **Sarah's amount**: 
   - Sarah raises $300.

4. **Maryam's amount**: 
   - Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. 
   - Therefore, Maryam's amount is:
     \[
     300 + 400 = 700
     \]

Now we have the amounts raised by each girl:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Next, we will calculate the total amount raised by all the girls:

1310,"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( v_A \) (in miles per minute) and the speed of Vanessa as \( v_V \) (in miles per minute).

According to the problem, we know two key relationships:

1. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa:
   \[
   v_A = 2v_V
   \]

2. Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron:
   \[
   d_V = 2d_A
   \]

From the problem, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Therefore, we can set \( d_V = 4 \) miles. 

Using the second relationship, we can express Aaron's distance:
\[
d_A = \frac{d_V}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. We can find Aaron's speed:
\[
v_A = \frac{d_A}{t_A} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Using the first relationship \( v_A = 2v_V \), we can find Vanessa's speed:
\[
\frac{1}{8} = 2v_V \implies v_V = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles:
\[
t_V = \frac{d_V}{v_V} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}

The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there is 200 feet of dock, we can calculate the total line needed as follows:

\[
\text{Total line needed} = 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line}
\]

Next, we need to consider how much line the caretaker already has. He currently has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount of line he has from the total line needed:

\[
\text{Line needed to buy} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already available} = 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}

1. **Calculate the total cost per reservation:**
   - Meals: 2 meals at $5 each = 2 * 5 = $10
   - Wine: 1 bottle at $5 = $5
   - Total per reservation = $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15

2. **Calculate the total revenue for one night:**
   - Reservations per night = 6
   - Total revenue for one night = 6 reservations * $15 per reservation = 6 * 15 = $90

3. **Calculate the total revenue for one week:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Total revenue for one week = 2 nights * $90 per night = 2 * 90 = $180

1313,"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to determine the total selling price after the vendor applies the profit margin.

1. **Calculate the cost price of one watermelon**:
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. Therefore, the cost price (CP) of one watermelon is:
   \[
   \text{CP per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the selling price with a profit of 25%**:
   The selling price (SP) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit}
   \]
   The profit is 25% of the cost price. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times \text{CP} = 0.25 \times 1.6 = 0.4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we can find the selling price:
   \[
   \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit} = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0 \text{ dollars}

1316,"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the cost of hiring the mechanic.

1. **Cost of the radiator:**
   - The original cost of the radiator is $400.
   - Mark gets it for 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.
   - To find 20% of $400, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80
     \]
   - So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

2. **Cost of hiring the mechanic:**
   - The mechanic charges $50 per hour.
   - The installation takes 3 hours.
   - To find the total cost for the mechanic, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 150
     \]
   - So, the cost for the mechanic is $150.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic:

We know two things from the problem:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:

1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4W = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
C + 2W = 35
\]

Now we have the simplified system:

1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve for \( W \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
W = 15
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( C = 5 \).
