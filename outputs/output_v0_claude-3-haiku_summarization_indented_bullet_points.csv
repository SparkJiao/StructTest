• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, such as ratchet systems, are not well-understood.
	• Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes, leading to complex phase-space structures and changes in transport properties.
• Mateos conjectured a connection between current reversal and bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior, but this was later disputed by Barbi and Salerno.
	• The authors investigate the ensemble dependence of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet system, finding that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.
• The authors find that:
	• Not all bifurcations lead to current reversal.
	• Not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations.
	• Most current reversals are associated with bifurcations.
	• Bifurcations correspond to sudden changes (spikes or jumps) in the current, which may or may not lead to current reversal.
• The authors emphasize the importance of understanding ensemble characteristics, especially near bifurcation points, when studying the transport properties of chaotic systems.
• The authors acknowledge the open questions and the need for further research to understand the reasons for when the proposed heuristic rules are valid or violated.

* The source document discusses the wide range of eccentricities observed in extrasolar planets, and several theories proposed to explain the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets.
    * One such method is planet-planet scattering, where multiple jovian planets interact and leave one in an eccentric orbit.
    * Interactions with stellar companions can also boost a planet's eccentricity.
* The authors aim to combine observational limits on additional planets in known planetary systems with dynamical constraints obtained by n-body simulations.
    * They performed test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems.
* The authors present updated keplerian orbital solutions for four of the six systems and find no evidence for additional objects in any of the six systems.
* The dynamical simulations show that the short-period planets in the hd 3651 and hd 37605 systems sweep clean the region inside about 0.5 au, but leave protected resonances where additional objects can exist.
    * For hd 45350 and hd 80606, the simulations restrict stable orbits to the innermost 0.2 au and 1.5 au, respectively.
* The authors compute companion limits using the high-precision HET data, finding the tightest limits for hd 3651, where they can exclude planets with masses greater than 2 Neptune masses for periods less than 1 year.
    * For hd 45350 and 16 cyg b, the dynamical simulations and detection limit computations complement each other, allowing the exclusion of additional planets with masses between 1 and 4 Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions.
* The authors conclude that there is no evidence for additional planets in the six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems studied, but that there are regions detectable by current surveys where additional objects can exist.

• The LEP experiments at the Z-boson resonance have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z-decay into fermion pairs with high accuracy.
    • The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions have severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Z-pole.
    • The physics of the Z-boson will again play a central role in particle physics if the next generation Z factory comes true with significantly higher Z events than LEP.
    • The International Linear Collider (ILC) with the GigaZ option can realize this Z factory by operating on top of the Z-boson resonance.
• The rare Z-decays, especially the flavor-changing (FC) processes and the decays into light Higgs boson(s), are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics.
    • The FC processes can be greatly enhanced in new physics models, with branching ratios up to 10^-6 for lepton flavor violation and 10^-5 for quark flavor violation.
    • The decays into light Higgs boson(s) can also have rates as large as 10^-4 in new physics models, within the expected sensitivity of the GigaZ.
• This work extends the previous studies of these rare Z-decays to some new models, including the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM).
    • These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the μ-problem and alleviate the little hierarchy problem by having a light CP-odd Higgs boson.
    • The properties of the light Higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before, motivating an update of the previous studies.

* Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale.
    * SUSY predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles, which should be within the TeV range and discoverable at the Tevatron or LHC.
    * The mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology, often related to high-energy physics above the electroweak scale.
    * The no-scale type Kähler potential, where the hidden and observable sectors are separated, is a highly predictive scenario with a few parameters.
* The no-scale scenario is constrained by various experimental bounds:
    * The minimal scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale is severely constrained by the cosmological bound and LEP 2 bounds.
    * The scenario with universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale is less constrained, and the Tevatron Run 2 may be able to explore a significant portion of the parameter space.
    * The scenario with non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale can have different LSP candidates (wino-like, higgsino-like, or sneutrino), with varying degrees of constraints.
* The Higgs mass bound and the B → Xsγ constraint further constrain the no-scale scenarios:
    * The minimal scenario is almost entirely excluded when combining these constraints.
    * The scenario with universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale still allows for a relatively large parameter region, depending on the sign of the Higgsino mass parameter.
    * The non-universal gaugino mass scenario is more sensitive to the Higgs mass bound, especially in the higgsino-like LSP case, where the LSP mass must be above 245 GeV (370 GeV) for positive (negative) Higgsino mass parameter.

* The paper analyzes the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities in the cross-polarized Bell-Szekeres (CPBS) spacetime:
    * The CPBS solution has QR singularities in the incoming regions, unlike the Bell-Szekeres (BS) solution which has a Cauchy horizon (CH) in the interaction region.
    * The stability conjecture by Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) is tested by introducing various test fields in the CPBS background.
    * The test EM field and scalar field analyses show that the QR singularities are unstable and transform into non-scalar curvature singularities (NSC) and scalar curvature singularities (SCS), respectively.
    * The exact back-reaction solutions for the EM-scalar field and null dust cases confirm the predictions of the HK conjecture.

* The paper also presents the following observations:
    * The HK conjecture fails to correctly predict the nature of singularities in the interaction region, which remains QR despite the addition of test fields.
    * The cross-polarization does not alter the singularity structure compared to the BS spacetime.
    * The exact back-reaction solutions show that the CH in the CPBS spacetime is unstable and transforms into a SCS in the presence of test fields or null dust.

* The paper concludes that the HK conjecture is a useful tool to study the stability of horizons and singularities, but its limitations in predicting the exact nature of singularities are also highlighted.

• The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively.
	• Folklore has it that Feynman mentioned this notion in casual conversations (circa 1985), but there did not exist concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates until the mid-1990s.
	• Encoding information in spin may have certain advantages, such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and potentially faster operation.
• In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
	• The ground state of the array has the spin configuration where the two edge dots are the input ports and the middle dot is the output port.
	• When the two inputs are logic 1, the output will be logic 0 due to the anti-ferromagnetic ordering, and when the two inputs are logic 0, the output must be logic 1 to conform to the anti-ferromagnetic ordering.
• The proposed spintronic logic gates have a severe shortcoming that precludes their use in pipelined architectures.
	• The exchange interaction is bidirectional, which cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signal from the input to the output of the logic device, a required attribute of any logic device.
	• Attempts to enforce unidirectionality, such as using the input device or progressively increasing the distance between cells, have limitations and are not elegant solutions.
• In 1996, a more elegant solution was proposed, which involves using a three-phase clock to propagate the input state through a linear array.
	• By lowering two adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time, the input state can be propagated through the array.
	• However, the need for a three-phase clock and the fabrication challenges associated with it make these devices less attractive for practical applications.

• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary
    • The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf
    • The orbital period distribution of CVs shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes
    • Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off
• The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum and ""hide"" the spike in the period distribution

    • They also investigate the effect of tidal deformation of the secondary star on the period minimum
• The authors compare the observed short-period CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions
    • They find that even a maximal efficient CAML mechanism cannot increase the bounce period sufficiently
    • They also find that an implausibly large deformation factor of around 1.18 is needed to obtain a bounce period of 78 minutes
• The authors employ a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to measure the ""goodness"" of fit against the observed sample
    • None of their synthesized model populations fits as well as the distribution which is simply flat in orbital period
    • Only models where brighter systems carry a far greater weight than expected in a simple magnitude-limited sample achieve similar values for the rejection probability

    * The warm molecular hydrogen (H2) emission dominates the mid-infrared emission of the Stephan's Quintet system, with a lower limit luminosity of 9.7 x 10^35 erg/s spread over 90 kpc^2.
    * There is evidence for another shock-excited feature, the ""H2 bridge"" between the main shock and NGC 7319, which is likely a remnant of past tidal interactions.
    * The global L(H2)/L_X ratio in the main shock is 3.3, and 2.5 in the ""bridge"" feature, indicating that the H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures.
    * Comparison of infrared ionic line ratios implies that both silicon and iron are depleted onto dust, suggesting that dust is not destroyed in the shock.
    * Star formation in Stephan's Quintet is dominated by two regions at the ends of the shock ridge, while the regions dominated by warm H2 emission exhibit very low star formation rates.
    * The observational results are consistent with a model of a multiphase post-shock medium produced by a galaxy-wide collision, where the cooling pathway of warm H2 emission is a significant mechanism in shock systems.

• The origin of celestial gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still an unsolved astrophysical phenomenon.
    • GRBs are powerful flashes of gamma-rays lasting from less than one second to tens of seconds, with an isotropic distribution in the sky.
    • The most likely explanations for GRBs are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of a compact binary system, both of which are expected to be associated with the emission of gravitational waves (GWs).
• The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, to study the correlation between GRBs and GW signals.
    • The agreement between the simulated input signals and the values calculated using the model shows that the model is correct.
    • The data are summarized by an observed average squared energy, which is at a certain standard deviation from the expected value in the case of noise alone.
• The Bayesian approach is used to infer the GW amplitude from the observed value of the average squared energy.
    • The probability density function of the GW amplitude is plotted, and the highest beliefs are for very small values, while values above a certain limit are practically ruled out.
    • An upper limit for the GW amplitude is provided, such that there is a given probability for the amplitude to be below it.
• The results are also presented in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound, which are considered the most complete and unbiased way of providing the experimental information.
    • The scaled likelihood function can be interpreted as a ""relative belief updating ratio"" or a ""probability density function shape distortion function"".
    • The sensitivity bound identifies the region where the experimental evidence does not produce any change in the belief, and values much larger than the bound are completely ruled out.

• The paper introduces the concept of ""shower partons"" and their momentum distributions to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
	• The shower partons are determined from the fragmentation functions using the recombination model.
• The shower parton distributions are shown to be useful in problems where the knowledge of the fragmentation functions alone is not sufficient, such as the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet.
	• The basic hadronization process is considered to be recombination, even for fragmentation in vacuum.
• The shower parton distributions obtained are model-dependent, as the recombination process can only be formulated in the framework of a model.
	• The formal description of how the Q^2 dependences of the fragmentation functions can be transferred to the Q^2 dependences of the shower parton distributions is a problem worth dedicated attention.

    • The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism to realize all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space.
    • The introduction of auxiliary fields and the use of the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field.
    • The main result is a set of Wightman two-point functions for the Maxwell and auxiliary fields, which are related to their Minkowskian counterparts through an ""extended Weyl transformation"".
• The authors show that the classical and quantum structures of the free Maxwell field are locally the same in all CFS.
    • This allows them to transport the physical quantities from Minkowski space into the CFS, simplifying the calculations.
    • The authors also consider the particular case of de Sitter space and provide the explicit expressions for the relevant two-point functions.
• The price to pay for maintaining the conformal invariance is the introduction of two auxiliary fields, which means that the Maxwell field does not propagate alone but together with its auxiliary fields.
    • Nonetheless, the authors suggest that using the full set of Wightman functions, including the auxiliary fields, may be useful for propagating the electromagnetic field in other CFS, such as FLRW spaces.

        • The onset of the GeV emission linked to the formation of a black hole.

• The main points with regard to the difference between the Euclidean lattice and the crystal lattice are the convergence of the Laplacian and the local ergodic theorem.

    • The trace of the second fundamental form of such maps vanishes.
    • The section defined by the tension field of a map is called the tension field, and a map is said to be harmonic if its tension field vanishes identically.
• The index of a harmonic map is defined as the dimension of the tangent subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite.
    • A harmonic map is said to be stable if the Morse index (the dimension of the largest subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite) is zero, and otherwise, it is said to be unstable.

• The premise of harmonic maps has acknowledged several important contributions and has been successfully applied in various fields, such as computational fluid dynamics, minimal surface theory, string theory, gravity, and quantum field theory.

* Under these assumptions, the authors suggest that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy at the TeV scale.
    * This scenario may provide a clue to the identity of dark energy and the resolution of the CCP.
* The authors discuss the evolution of dark energy, which is found to vary logarithmically with the temperature of the universe.
    * The logarithmically changing energy density is described by a van der Waals-type equation of state.
* The authors conclude that the CCP may require a new ingredient or a novel formalism in the theory of gravity, and further investigation of the relationship between classical and quantum gravitational fields is necessary.

* The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years.
    * A main focus of interest is the central exclusive production (CEP) process, in which the protons remain intact and the central system is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap.
    * Observation of any particle, such as a standard model Higgs boson, in the central exclusive channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers.
* The proposed forward detectors aim to associate particular protons with the Higgs candidate event by making a measurement of the outgoing proton time-of-flight (TOF) from the interaction vertex to the detectors.
    * The difference in the arrival times of the protons on opposite sides of the central detector, ΔtTOF, allows a vertex measurement to be made under the assumption that the detected pair of protons originate from a single hard interaction.
    * This vertex can then be matched with the vertex of a candidate Higgs event reconstructed using the central detector alone.
* The acceptance of the forward detectors is governed by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam, which determines the smallest measurable energy loss of the outgoing protons, and the aperture of the LHC beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors.
    * The acceptance for a 120 GeV Higgs boson is independent of the distance of approach of the detectors from the beam up to approximately 7 mm in the case where both protons are detected at 420 m.
    * Moving the 420 m detectors inwards to 3 mm and the 220 m detectors to 1.5 mm increases the asymmetric acceptance by up to a factor of three.
* The backgrounds to central exclusive Higgs production can be broken down into three categories: central exclusive di-jet production, double pomeron exchange, and overlap.
    * The most difficult backgrounds to deal with are the central exclusive di-jet backgrounds, which are suppressed at leading order by the C-even selection rule but are still present and form an irreducible continuum background beneath the Higgs mass peak.

* Zero-field Hall effect in chiral d-wave superconductors (SCs) has drawn much attention in literature recently.
    * This effect can arise from the nature of broken time reversal symmetry, the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs, spontaneous surface current, impurity effects, or multi-band SC structure.
* In this work, the authors address the zero-field Hall effect in a chiral d-wave SC originating from the vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition.
    * In two-dimensional (2D) superfluid (SF) or SC films, quantized vortices are realized as topological defects in the condensates, and their dynamics is a key ingredient in understanding 2D phase transition phenomena.
* The authors generalize the AHNS (Ambegaokar, Halperin, Nelson, and Siggia) vortex dynamics in the chiral d-wave SC context.
    * They derive the pair-size-dependent response functions, which play a determining role in the behavior of the Hall conductivity and AC conductivity near the KT transition.
* The authors investigate the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor, treating the bound pair and the free vortex contribution separately.
    * The Hall conductivity shows strong positive peaks and sign changes in the suitable frequency region above the transition temperature, as well as above the KT transition temperature in the temperature domain at fixed frequencies.
* The authors discuss the contribution of free vortex motion and the resulting total conductivity tensor.
    * In the high-temperature phase, the free vortex contribution dominates in the static limit, and the Hall conductivity and dissipation are protected from divergence in the zero-frequency limit but have strong signals when approaching the KT transition temperature from above.

    * This torque has been theoretically predicted but not yet experimentally observed.
* The authors calculate the magnitude of the torque between a birefringent disk and a birefringent plate in vacuum and in liquid ethanol.

    * The torque is found to be within the sensitivity of available instrumentation, provided the surfaces are kept at sub-micron distances.

    • Although a debris disk has lost most of its primordial material, the observed infrared luminosity of circumstellar dust is typically several orders of magnitude larger than estimated for the Kuiper and asteroid belts in our solar system.
    • Only a few edge-on debris disks have been found, including HD32297, which is the focus of this study.
• The study presents high-resolution optical spectra of the Na I D doublet toward HD32297 and nearby stars.
    • Two absorption components are detected toward HD32297, while only one is detected toward its proximate neighbors, indicating that the extra component is likely caused by circumstellar material.
    • Some indication of temporal variability is detected in the circumstellar absorption toward HD32297, but a definitive detection is difficult due to instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong interstellar absorption.
    • The measured circumstellar feature toward HD32297 is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk, about 45 times greater than the column density of the prototypical edge-on debris disk, β Pic.
• The study provides insights into the gas and dust components of the debris disk around HD32297.
    • If the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component around HD32297 are assumed to be similar to β Pic, an upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding HD32297 is estimated to be about 0.3 Earth masses.
    • Future observations are planned to continue monitoring the temporal variability of the circumstellar gas toward HD32297 and to measure the gas disk absorption to independently determine the gas-to-dust ratio.

    * The anomalous dimensions of the operators and the couplings in 3-point correlation functions need to be found.
    * The 3-point function of scalar primary operators has a simple form, and the definition of the couplings requires the operators to diagonalize the anomalous dimension matrix.

    * A more promising approach is to explore the integrability of planar N=4 SYM, but it remains unclear how integrability will enter the computations of the couplings.

* At strong 't Hooft coupling, the AdS/CFT duality can be used to compute the couplings.
    * The duality relates the string partition function, computed with suitable boundary conditions, to the generating functional for correlation functions of the gauge theory.

    * The distribution function is expressed in terms of the matrix elements of the Green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field.
    * The authors present analytical results for short and long wormlike chains, which are in agreement with previous studies.
* The authors find that the distribution function possesses a bimodal shape for intermediate chain lengths, consistent with recent studies on two-dimensional wormlike chains.
    * In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the three-dimensional chain shows only a tiny peak at the onset of bimodality, which disappears for larger chain lengths.

    • Three methods have been proposed to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs:
        • Optical afterglow light curve breaks
        • Optical afterglow polarization
        • Orphan afterglow searches
    • Measurement of the GRB beaming angle using orphan afterglow searches is extremely difficult due to the uncertainty in the trigger time.

• The study examines the difference between type 1 and type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) in terms of angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region.
    • The obscuring dusty medium, commonly referred to as the ""dust torus,"" is optically and geometrically thick and extends from sub-parsec scales outward to several 10s of parsecs.
    • The dust in the torus absorbs the incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the received energy in the infrared.
• The study uses a (nearly) isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies at z~2 to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of the AGN emission in the infrared.
    • The authors apply host-galaxy subtraction for the radio galaxies and use clumpy torus models for interpretation.
    • The results show that the ratio between type 1 and type 2 AGN gradually decreases from 20 to 2 at wavelengths 2 to 8 μm, and the intrinsic ratio between type 1 and type 2 AGN is 1.4 at 15 μm.
• The observed anisotropy is consistent with expectations from clumpy torus models, suggesting that the anisotropy is a measure of the intrinsic anisotropy of luminous type 1 and type 2 AGN at z~2.

• The paper analyzes the effect of local oscillator (LO) intensity fluctuation on the security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems.
	• The traditional security analysis of CVQKD systems does not consider the LO, which can be exploited by Eve to reduce the channel excess noise and intercept partial or full secret keys without being detected.
• The paper proposes an attacking scheme, called the LO intensity attack (LOIA), where Eve can reduce the LO intensity to manipulate the channel parameters and obtain information about the secret keys.
	• The paper analyzes the secret key rates for both reverse and direct reconciliation protocols, showing that the secret key rate can be severely compromised if Bob does not monitor the LO intensity and scale his measurements accordingly.
• The paper demonstrates that Eve can intercept partial or full secret keys by controlling the LO intensity, especially in the case of reverse reconciliation and low channel transmission.
	• The paper discusses the challenges of accurately monitoring the LO intensity fluctuations to confirm the security of practical CVQKD implementations.
• The paper concludes that monitoring the LO intensity and scaling the measurements accordingly is crucial for the security of practical CVQKD systems, especially for reverse reconciliation and long-distance communication.

* The paper is motivated by a result from Berestycki et al. on the Laplacian perturbed by a divergence-free drift in dimensions d.
    * The main result of the paper is that if Ω is a bounded domain with C^1-regular boundary that is simply connected, and the drift field b is of zero divergence, then the principal eigenvalue λ_1 of the fractional Laplacian perturbed by b remains bounded as the fractional exponent α approaches 2, and the infimum is attained.
    * The paper uses the Green function and transition density of the fractional Laplacian, as well as approximation techniques for flows, to define and study the principal eigen-pair for the perturbed operator.
    * The main difficulty stems from the roughness of general elements of the Sobolev space and the non-locality of the fractional Laplacian, which prevent a direct application of the differential calculus used in the case of local operators.
    * The paper also establishes a localization principle for the perturbation problem, showing that the Green's and transition operators do not depend on the values of the drift field outside the domain.
* The paper provides a rigorous proof of the main result by establishing lower and upper bounds for the principal eigenvalue.
    * The proof uses conditioning of truncations of the first integrals by the principal eigenfunction, and characterizes the first integrals as those elements that are constant along the flow of the vector field.
    * The paper also considers the case where the drift field is only defined on the domain, and extends it to the entire space using a mollifier.
    * The attainability of the infimum on the right-hand side of the main result is proved using a compactness argument and the Krein-Rutman theorem.
    * The paper concludes with a discussion of the different behavior of the eigenproblems for different values of the fractional exponent α, and their connection to the escape rate of the corresponding isotropic α-stable Lévy processes.

• The authors' calculations show that the predicted gamma-ray spectra differ substantially between high and low column-density clouds.
    • At low column densities, the thin material limit can be adopted, but above a certain threshold, the emissivity drops rapidly with increasing cloud column-density.
    • The authors' results suggest that the baryonic content of the galaxy's dark halo is not as tightly constrained by the gamma-ray data as previously thought.
• The authors have developed models for the distribution of dark matter clouds and cosmic-ray intensity in the galaxy to calculate the diffuse gamma-ray emission.

* The kinetics of polymer loop formation is important in biology, such as in DNA loop formation, protein folding, and RNA structure formation.
    * DNA loop formation is a basic process that underlies genetic expression, replication, and recombination.
    * The hairpin loop formation is the elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding.
    * The cell interior is an active and non-equilibrium medium, with fluctuating forces that can affect DNA loop formation.
    * Single-molecule experiments have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation, including the effects of mechanical constraints such as tension and torsion.
* The authors perform Brownian dynamics simulations of semiflexible polymers to study the effects of static and fluctuating tension on polymer looping.
    * For static tension, they find that a small tension of 100 fN can dramatically increase the looping time, especially for longer chains.
    * This sensitivity is a consequence of the cooperativity of the chain arising from chain connectivity.
    * For time-dependent tension, they consider dichotomically fluctuating tension and find a resonant minimum in the looping time at an optimal flipping time.
    * The effect of time-dependent tension is also more significant for longer chains.

* The paper introduces a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light.
    * The principle of the method is based on the analysis of the intensity-intensity correlation function and the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
    * The method permits to monitor the relative distance between the sources in the range 10-500 nm, with a precision that is not limited by diffraction, but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.
    * The approach replaces the two-point field-field correlation of the background noise by a measurement at a single point of the intensity noise due to the two fluctuating sources, which might simplify the technique, particularly at visible or near-IR frequencies.
* The paper derives a relationship between the temporal fluctuations of the total power emitted by two incoherent sources and the cross-density of states (CDOS) connecting the source points in an arbitrary environment.
    * The CDOS is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green function, which is at the core of Green's function retrieval techniques based on ambient noise correlations.
    * The paper shows that the power fluctuations encode the interdistance between the sources, and that this information can be accessed from measurements of the directional intensity, and not only from measurements of the total power.

* Topological insulators have been extensively studied due to their robust surface metallic states, which typically arise from strong spin-orbit interactions.
    * However, the search for topological materials has been constrained by the requirement of heavy or rare metal elements.
    * It has been proposed that an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin-orbit interaction, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase, known as a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
* The stability of the TMI phase in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been a challenge due to competing orders, such as charge density waves (CDWs).
    * The mean-field analysis and variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method reveal that the long-range CDW is much more stable than the TMI in the standard honeycomb lattice model.
    * To stabilize the TMI, the authors found that reducing the Fermi velocity at the Dirac cones is crucial.
* The authors propose that twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) can be a promising platform for realizing TMIs.
    * TBLG offers Dirac electrons with tunable Fermi velocities, including the limit of zero Fermi velocity, which is favorable for the stabilization of TMIs.

    * The observations were carried out over a period of about a month in 2007, and the authors obtained a time lag of about 4 days between the changes in the Hβ emission line flux and the changes in the continuum flux at 5100 Å.
    * After correcting for the redshift, the authors found a time lag of 3.2 days in the rest frame of the source, which corresponds to a BLR radius of 0.67 parsec.
    * Using the line dispersion of the Hβ emission line, the authors estimated the mass of the SMBH in H 0507+164 to be 1.8 × 10^6 solar masses.

• The broad emission iron lines are well-known features found in active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, and are supposed to originate close to the black hole by the reflection of the primary radiation on the accretion disc.
    • The spin of the black hole plays an important role in the forming of the line shape, and the most widely used model of the relativistic disc spectral line has been the Laor model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole.
• The study compared the Laor model and the more recent model, which allows the spin parameter to be fitted, and found that the Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.
    • The discrepancies between the two models are more visible for lower values of the spin, and the correct re-binning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution is crucial to obtain statistically the most relevant results.

• The paper discusses axially symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations corresponding to disk-like configurations of matter, which are of great astrophysical interest as models of galaxies or accretion disks.
    • These solutions can be static or stationary, with or without radial pressure.
    • The principal method used to generate these solutions is the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method.
    • One of the main problems with the solutions generated using this method is that the matter content of the disk is usually anisotropic, with the radial pressure being different from the azimuthal pressure.
• In this article, the authors apply the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method to spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates to generate static disks made of a perfect fluid, with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure.
    • The authors also generate disks of perfect fluid surrounded by a halo made of perfect fluid matter.
    • The authors present several models of disks with halos obtained from different known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates.

	• Recent experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have made progress towards this goal, with the creation of systems where two species of atoms condense simultaneously.
• The text introduces the field-theoretical description of binary BECs and discusses the symmetry properties of such systems.
	• In the presence of a coupling drive, one of the U(1) symmetries is explicitly violated, leading to the existence of a nontrivial static configuration: a domain wall.
• The domain wall solution is similar to the kink in the sine-Gordon field theory, but it is not topologically stable and can decay.
	• The domain wall is metastable and can decay through thermal activation or quantum tunneling, depending on the temperature and the strength of the coupling drive.
• The text suggests a possible method for the controlled creation of domain walls in experiments by manipulating the initial state of the two condensates.
	• The domain walls can be bounded by vortex lines, leading to the phenomenon of ""vortex confinement"" similar to quark confinement in quantum chromodynamics.
• The authors conclude that the experimental realization of the domain walls discussed in the paper is within reach, given the current state of the art in BEC experiments.

    * Anomalies occur when a symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantized version.
    * The breakdown of an internal symmetry (gauge symmetry) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory, while the breakdown of an external symmetry can provide physical explanations.
    * Gravitational anomalies can be classified into three types: Einstein anomaly, Lorentz anomaly, and Weyl anomaly.
    * The anomalies have been calculated using various approaches, including perturbation theory, heat kernel method, Fujikawa's path integral approach, and modern mathematical techniques.
* The text presents a method of dispersion relations (DR) as an alternative approach to calculating the gravitational anomalies and Schwinger terms.
    * The DR approach is an independent and complementary view of the anomaly phenomenon compared to the ultraviolet regularization procedures.
    * The DR method and the dimensional regularization procedure are shown to be equivalent, with the formfactors in both approaches being related by suitable substitutions.
    * The origin of the anomaly in the DR approach is the existence of a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of the relevant formfactor, which exhibits a delta-function singularity in the infrared region.
    * The gravitational Schwinger terms are also calculated using the DR approach, and they are shown to be related to the gravitational anomalies.

    * The free energy and entropy per baryon for QGP are found to be larger than those of strange quark matter.

    * The model includes one real scalar field and one complex scalar field, and their dynamical equations were solved for a particular solution that leads to AdS confinement.
    * The model has been further simplified to compare its properties with the actually measured cross sections and branching ratios, by coupling the AdS spectrum to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products.
    * The authors found an apparent interference effect around the Υ(1S) threshold in the invariant-mass distribution of Υ(1S) events, which could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of the Υ(1S) pair and that of the gluon cloud.
* The authors present experimental evidence for the possible existence of a quantum with a mass of about 38 MeV, which they believe to be the scalar boson related to confinement.

* The authors analyze the limitations of the two-gluon exchange model and show that the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially non-perturbative.

    * The paper also introduces two new datasets, Bruce-A and Judd-A, which are more challenging than existing datasets and can be used to benchmark salient object detection models.
* The text analyzes the relationship between explicit saliency judgments and free-viewing fixations, and shows that they agree to a large extent.
    * The paper demonstrates that existing state-of-the-art salient object detection models perform poorly on the new datasets, highlighting the need for more robust and scalable models.
    * The paper suggests that the main reason for the performance drop is the inability of the models to segment the most salient object, rather than accurately segmenting the object region.
* The text discusses the limitations of the proposed baseline model and suggests future research directions, such as incorporating boundary information and exploring the interplay between saliency detection, fixation prediction, and object proposal generation.

* The paper extends the results of Yetter, generalizing classical results of Gerstenhaber and Gerstenhaber and Schack on the infinitesimal deformation theory of associative algebras and poset-indexed diagrams of associative algebras to a deformation theory for arbitrary pasting diagrams of k-linear categories, k-linear functors, and natural transformations.
    * The standard result that obstructions are cocycles was established only for the simplest parts of pasting diagrams, and this paper establishes it for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general.
* The paper makes explicit a point overlooked in the statements and proofs of previous theorems: the cochain maps constructed in those theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions in the pasting diagram.
    * However, the cochain maps are independent of those choices, up to algebraic homotopy, and thus, the isomorphism type of the deformation complex for a pasting diagram is well-defined in either the homotopy category or derived category of cochain complexes over k.
* The paper uses the cochain maps from the previous section to give explicit examples of deformation complexes associated to various shapes commutative pasting diagrams, and shows that the cochain maps induced by two different associations of the 2-dimensional composition are not actually equal, but only chain homotopic.
    * The paper also considers deformations of pasting diagrams in which specified functors or natural transformations are required to be deformed trivially, which could be useful in other settings.

• The aim in physics is to understand the physical picture responsible for a given phenomenon, not just to calculate an observable.
	• Fundamental degrees of freedom can become overcomplicated at the relevant scale, so it is necessary to select the essential degrees of freedom.
	• In the case of crystals, the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, but to understand properties like electrical conductivity and heat capacity, it is more useful to work with ""heavy electrons,"" phonons, and their interactions.
• In QCD, the full non-quenched theory on the lattice can provide the correct nucleon and pion masses in terms of the underlying degrees of freedom, but at the scale of 1 GeV, QCD becomes too complicated.
	• The most important QCD phenomenon at this scale is the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which leads to the appearance of light pseudoscalar mesons and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by the valence quarks.
	• The constituent quarks and the Goldstone bosons are coupled with a strength given by the Goldberger-Treiman relation.
• The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry gives rise to a short-range spin-flavor force between the constituent quarks, which is crucial for understanding the baryon spectrum.
	• This short-range force, combined with a harmonic confining interaction, can explain the ordering of the lowest positive and negative parity states in the baryon spectrum, which cannot be solved with other types of hyperfine interactions.
• The semirelativistic chiral constituent quark model, which includes linear pairwise confining interaction and chiral interactions mediated by pseudoscalar, scalar, and vector meson exchanges, provides a unified description of both non-strange and strange baryon spectra in good agreement with phenomenology.
	• The short-range part of the chiral interaction, which is responsible for the hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy, also induces a strong short-range repulsion in the NN system, which is related to the specific flavor-spin symmetry of the chiral interaction.

* The present invention relates to a Downconverting Digitizer that can sample and downconvert a modulated IF signal to digital in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) baseband components.
    * The Downconverting Digitizer consists of several key elements:
        * A digitally-controlled variable gain amplifier that adjusts the amplitude of the modulated IF input signal
        * A predictive digital filter that generates a prediction of the modulated IF signal
        * An offset nuller element that dynamically removes offsets introduced by the implementation
        * An automatic gain control (AGC) loop that maintains the amplitude of the modulated carrier within the dynamic range of the predictive loop
        * A digital quadrature mixer that downconverts the output of the predictive filter to baseband I and Q components
        * Rate reduction filters that filter and reduce the sampling rate of the I and Q outputs
* The placement of the sampler inside the predictive loop allows the predictive filter to be implemented using digital signal processing techniques, reducing the complexity of the overall converter.
* Operating the predictive encoder in a subharmonic mode allows further reduction in the complexity of the digital logic used in implementing the predicting digital filter.
* Using the digital predictive loop output to control the gain level applied to the input signal allows further increase of the dynamic range of the converter.
* Incorporating a built-in offset nuller dramatically enhances the DC offset performance of the analog-to-digital conversion process.
* The Downconverting Digitizer was implemented in a CMOS integrated circuit and achieved more than 52 dB of dynamic range without the AGC loop, and more than 124 dB with the AGC loop.

* The Social Security Act of 1935 gave workers the right to review their earnings records with the Social Security Administration (SSA).
    * In 1988, SSA introduced the Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) to enable workers to review their earnings records and obtain benefit estimates.
    * Fewer than 2% of workers request these statements each year, so SSA plans to mail them automatically to over 70 million workers by 2000.
    * The goals of the PEBES initiative are to better inform the public, assist workers in planning their financial future, and ensure the accuracy of Social Security earnings records.
    * The projected cost of the PEBES in fiscal year 2000 is $80 million, including $56 million for production and $24 million for personnel.
* The PEBES benefit estimates are based on certain assumptions about future employment and earnings, which may not accurately reflect the circumstances of all workers.
    * For example, the estimates may overstate benefits for federal workers eligible for both Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security benefits.
    * SSA has included descriptions of circumstances that may result in workers receiving different benefits than estimated, but it would be difficult to modify the estimates to reflect these circumstances.
    * Overall public reaction to the PEBES has been favorable, with older individuals reacting more positively than younger individuals.
    * However, the current PEBES statement provides too much information, which may overwhelm the reader, and presents the information in a way that undermines its usefulness.
* Revisions to the PEBES are needed to improve its layout, design, and explanations, and SSA should evaluate alternative formats for communicating the information.
    * SSA should systematically obtain more detailed feedback from front-line workers and conduct formal comprehension tests to identify and address the statement's weaknesses.

• SSA administers two disability programs: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
    • Both programs use the same definition of disability for initial entitlement
    • DI is an insurance program that requires a specified number of work credits, while SSI is a means-tested program that does not require a work history
    • Concurrent beneficiaries receive benefits from both programs
• Concurrent beneficiaries have the following characteristics:
    • Comprise about 14% of SSA's disability population
    • Are more likely to have mental impairments and be female
    • Have an average age of 45
    • About 11% work, with a median earned income of $250 per month
• SSA faces challenges in administering the DI and SSI programs for concurrent beneficiaries:
    • Lack of integrated guidance and procedures for handling work activity information
    • Difficulty in timely adjusting DI benefits when concurrent beneficiaries work
    • Lack of public information materials that clearly explain the complex interaction of the two programs
• SSA has taken steps to address these challenges, such as:
    • Testing an ""employment support representative"" position to handle work-related issues for all beneficiaries
    • Developing a new computer system to collect information about the monthly earnings of all DI beneficiaries who are working
• Recommendations for SSA:

* NFIP offers two types of flood insurance premiums: subsidized and full risk.
    * Subsidized premium rates, which represent about 40 to 45 percent of the cost of covering the full risk of flood damage, apply to about 22 percent of all NFIP policies.

    * The official U.S. poverty rate was 14.5% in 2013, a statistically significant drop from 15.0% in 2012.
    * The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) provides a more comprehensive view of poverty, including the effects of government programs and necessary expenses.
    * The SPM paints a different picture of poverty, with higher rates among the elderly and lower rates among children compared to the official measure.
        * The SPM poverty rate for the elderly is 14.6%, compared to 9.5% under the official measure.
        * The SPM poverty rate for children is 16.4%, compared to 20.3% under the official measure.
        * The SPM captures the effects of in-kind benefits and necessary expenses, such as child care and medical costs, which significantly impact poverty rates.
        * The SPM's expanded definition of economic units also contributes to differences in poverty rates compared to the official measure.

    * The U.S. farm policy is subject to intense scrutiny for compliance with current WTO rules and its potential to affect future multilateral negotiations.
    * The U.S. is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA).
* The U.S. farm programs are also subject to the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), which evaluates the market distortion of a program or policy in terms of its measurable market effects on international trade and/or market price.
    * The WTO's dispute settlement process can lead to the elimination, alteration, or amendment of U.S. farm programs that are found to be in violation of WTO rules.
    * The U.S. has never exceeded its AMS limit, with the closest approach being in 2000 when the U.S. notified a total AMS of $16.8 billion.
* The U.S. has notified various domestic policies to the WTO, including green box policies ($127.5 billion), blue box policies ($0), de minimis exclusions ($5.3 billion), and amber box policies ($6.9 billion).

    • Whether the current formula for allocating funds to institutions is optimal.
    • The potential role of the campus-based aid programs in a redesigned federal aid system.

    * The systems were authorized either by law or executive order, with most states passing a law to create the alert system.
* Administration of the alert systems is a cooperative effort among state and local law enforcement agencies:
    * Six states have a lead state agency responsible for activating alerts, while five states have localized models where the local law enforcement agency activates the alerts.
* States have defined their target population for the alert systems differently, with some including age as a factor and others focusing on cognitive, physical, or developmental disabilities:
    * Verification of a cognitive impairment or other disability is often included as part of the state's criteria for activating an alert.
* States provided varying levels of detail about training for law enforcement agencies and the public on the use of the alert system:
    * Eight of the 11 states reported that training was provided to state and/or local enforcement agencies, and four of these also provided training or educational materials to the public and other stakeholders.
* The process for activating an alert varies across states, but generally begins with the local law enforcement agency taking a missing persons report:
    * States have defined common criteria for activating an alert, such as the person's status being unknown and their disappearance posing a credible threat to their health or safety.
* Most states have mechanisms in place for coordinating alerts with other states to recover individuals who were believed to have crossed state lines during their disappearance:
    * Several states indicated there was no additional cost to implement the alert system or that implementation costs were absorbed by the existing budget for the AMBER alert program or another program.
* Ten out of 11 states reported having used the alert system, with the number of alerts activated ranging from 1 to 82:
    * Most states were able to provide information about the outcomes of recovery efforts, with the majority reporting that individuals were found recovered, though almost every state reported at least one individual who was found deceased.

    • Gross job loss is a normal part of a functioning market economy and is caused by changes in tastes, technology, and comparative advantage, but is often offset by gross job gains.
• Factors such as trade, trade deficits, offshore outsourcing, and economic restructuring cause gross job loss but do not typically cause net job loss.
    • The exception is economic downturns, which are the only factor that causes both gross and net job loss.
• Public policies can be justified to protect workers against the risks posed by gross job loss, such as through unemployment insurance, but should be balanced with maintaining market dynamism.

    * Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients.
    * Associations with disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
* Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients with EAC or ESCC.
* In a multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved DFS compared to patients with the wild-type genotype.
* Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had a significantly reduced survival compared to patients with the wild-type genotype.
* The study suggests that inter-individual differences in germline DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.

* The surge in research has also revealed various impacts of invasive species, including predation, competition, and disease transmission.
    * Invasive species can also affect nutrient cycles, fire cycles, and other ecosystem-level processes.
    * Molecular genetic techniques have uncovered cases of hybridization and introgression between native and introduced species, as well as the use of environmental DNA to detect invaders.
    * The research has also revealed instances of ""invasional meltdown,"" where introduced species facilitate each other's establishment and impact on native species, and ""lag effects,"" where the full impact of an invader is delayed.
* Despite the growing body of research, a small group of critics has challenged the field of invasion biology and the efforts to manage invasive species.

    * The study had a relatively small sample size and lacked pharmacokinetic analysis to detect differences in active metabolite concentrations.
    * Limitations of the study include the use of LTA, which is subject to operator variability, and the fact that on-treatment platelet aggregation may not directly reflect P2Y12 receptor inhibition by active clopidogrel metabolites.
    * The study suggests that PON1 Q192R polymorphisms may not be predictive of clopidogrel response when measured by LTA and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay in patients with coronary artery disease.

    * The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in β-cell function over the course of follow-up.
    * β-cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
* Participants receiving rosiglitazone versus placebo had a significant increase in IGI/IR during the study and a significant decrease in PI/C.
    * In contrast, there were no significant changes in IGI/IR or PI/C in participants receiving ramipril versus placebo.
    * The impact of rosiglitazone on IGI/IR and PI/C was similar within subgroups of isolated IGT and combined IFG and IGT, although effects were more modest in those with isolated IFG.
* Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI after adjustment for age and HOMA-IR, and significantly reduced PI concentrations over time after adjustment for age and C-peptide concentration.
    * In contrast, ramipril did not significantly affect adjusted IGI or PI concentrations.
* The demonstration that an agent that reduces diabetes incidence also improves β-cell function invites the hypothesis that measures of change in β-cell function in response to therapy are indexes of that therapy's ability to reduce the incidence of diabetes.
    * The modest attenuation of rosiglitazone's effect after accounting for the change in β-cell function suggests that some but not all of the effect of rosiglitazone on diabetes prevention/delay is mediated through its effects on β-cell function.

        • The study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey, and a total of 200 healthy volunteers from the Bagh-e-Malek area participated.
        • Microscopy and RDT tests did not detect any positive cases, but nested-PCR analysis identified 3 (1.5%) asymptomatic P. vivax infections.
        • All infected subjects were treated after diagnosis by standard anti-malarial drugs, and reevaluated after treatment by means of molecular method.
• In the elimination phase of malaria control, monitoring all cases, particularly hidden parasites, is of major importance.
    • Microscopy and RDT are currently used for active case surveillance in malaria endemic areas of Iran, but these methods may not be able to detect asymptomatic and mixed infections.
    • Molecular methods, such as nested-PCR, have been recognized as valuable and robust approaches for detecting sub-clinical parasitemia, asymptomatic carriers, and confirming Plasmodium species in low-transmission areas.

* The study aimed to evaluate the use of serum antibody responses to a panel of prostate tissue- and prostate cancer-associated antigens as a diagnostic tool to evaluate immune responses elicited following immune-active therapies.
    * The study found that antigen-specific IgG responses could be detected, likely elicited as a result of therapy, and the patterns of response differed with respect to the individual therapy.
* The study used machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) to identify groups of IgG responses that are associated with clinical response, using data obtained at three months.
    * The study identified a subset of biomarkers that were associated with PSA decline, and further modeling could support the translation of this research into a clinical application for determining whether an individual patient has responded to a particular vaccine therapy.
* The study suggests that with data from larger populations of subjects, models could be developed to assist in the detection of potentially therapeutic immune responses resulting from immune-based therapies.
    * The study found that immune-active therapies, including androgen deprivation, elicit IgG responses to individual prostate-associated antigens, and the recognition of different antigens suggests different mechanisms of antigen spread or recognition of other tissue-derived antigens.
* The use of ML-BBN modeling appears to provide a promising method for identifying biomarkers in complex data sets that can then be selected for further analysis.

• Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and aspirin therapy is a recommended prevention measure.
    • However, many studies have failed to ascertain whether individuals were recommended to take aspirin by their physician or were taking it on their own.
    • This study aimed to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention in a nationally representative sample.
• The study found that:
    • Less than a third of the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin.
    • Less than half of the primary-prevention patients who had a high coronary heart disease (CHD) risk level received a recommendation to take aspirin.
    • Demographic and access-to-care variables, such as education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care, were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention.
• The results suggest a disconnect between risk for future CVD and aspirin recommendations, and access to care may play a role in recommendations and use of aspirin for CVD prevention.
    • Improved clinical decision support tools and interventions to reinforce the use of appropriate risk calculation are necessary to ensure that patients receive appropriate preventive care.

• The control of appetite is complex and involves inputs from physiological and environmental sources.
    • Early theoretical approaches focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids/proteins, and adipose tissue.
    • More recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, including hormones like leptin, ghrelin, and GLP-1.
    • Interest in this type of formulation strengthened during the rise of molecular biology as an explanatory approach.
• An alternative view stems from the study of energy balance, the interrelationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI).
    • Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of total daily EE and could provide a tonic signal of energy demand that drives daily EI.
    • Exercise can have different effects on appetite, including a tonic stimulation of appetite and a counteractive meal-related episodic inhibition.
• Detailed analysis has demonstrated that fat-free mass (FFM), but not fat mass or BMI, is strongly correlated with meal size and daily EI.
    • RMR, which is positively associated with FFM, is also a predictor of fasting hunger levels and influences the profile of hunger across the day.
    • The strong implication is that RMR, as a measure of EE, reflects a physiological demand for energy that acts as a driver of food intake.
• A proposed formulation suggests that the drive to eat arises from FFM and RMR, under tonic inhibition from leptin, and is periodically interrupted by episodic satiety signals.
    • This formulation can incorporate an extended role for leptin and is consistent with a widening ergostatic function of additional adipokinetic hormones.
    • The recognition that FFM and FM have different functional properties in relation to appetite is a strong reason to use body composition, rather than just body weight or BMI, in research and management of obesity.

    * A bioinformatic approach was used to identify potential antisense transcripts and design SARNAs targeting the promoter regions of KLF4 and c-MYC.
* The KLF4-PR1 and MYC-PR2 SARNAs were found to consistently upregulate the expression of their target genes at both the mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
    * The upregulation of KLF4 and c-MYC by the SARNAs was confirmed to be due to transcriptional activation, without inducing an interferon response.
* Microarray analysis revealed that the gene expression profiles induced by SARNA-mediated upregulation of KLF4 and c-MYC were largely concordant with those observed upon overexpression of the exogenous genes using lentiviral vectors.
    * The differences in gene expression profiles between SARNA and lentiviral approaches were attributed to the cellular changes in response to oligonucleotide transfection versus viral transduction, rather than off-target effects.
* The SARNA-mediated upregulation of KLF4 was able to activate the expression of other key pluripotency factors, including OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, in the MSCs.

* The healthcare industry faces challenges in improving access, cost, and quality of care, and research institutions are experiencing significant stress from more competition for less funding.
    * Successful innovation in healthcare requires navigating a long and challenging journey between an unmet need or discovery generated from basic research to a viable commercial product or service.
    * The ""valley of death"" that exists between academic research and commercialization of a new product is often cited as a key obstacle for health innovations.
    * Many academic investigators and research teams are not prepared or motivated to think beyond their work in the lab to anticipate or address commercial issues.
    * Universities and academic medical centers need to do more in preparing and supporting investigators interested in translating research into practice.
* Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPs) are an emerging option for academic investigators to strike a balance by cost-effectively advancing a project into commercialization while simultaneously building the skills of team members.
    * HCPs differ from the I-Corps program in addressing the unique challenges facing healthcare innovations, such as buying dynamics, reimbursement complexity, regulatory pathway, culture, and funding requirements.
    * Key distinguishing features of HCPs include team composition, executive faculty, content, style, and ecosystem leverage.
    * HCPs offer institutions and funders an additional option to improve the efficiency with which healthcare projects they support reach practice and improve people's health.

* The tape is not positioned caudally but lies as a band behind the urethra, suggesting its passive (non-obstructive) role in achieving continence.
* The in-out trajectory showed higher variability, underscoring the need for strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique.
