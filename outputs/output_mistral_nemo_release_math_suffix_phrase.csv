1,"To solve this problem, we start by determining the amount of white fiber needed for the robe. Since it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and we know that 2 bolts of blue fiber are required, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber}$
White fiber = $\frac{1}{2} \times 2$
White fiber = 1 bolt

Now, to find the total bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required to make the robe is $\boxed{3}$.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
2,"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. If the repairs increased the value by 150%, we add 150% of the original value to the original value itself.

150% of $80,000 is calculated as:
(150/100) * $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

Now, add this to the original value to find the new value:
$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the purchase price plus the repair costs:
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repair costs) = $130,000

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:

1. First, we find out how many meters he runs in one sprint. Since he runs 60 meters each sprint, we have:
\[ \text{Meters per sprint} = 60 \, \text{meters} \]

2. Next, we calculate the total meters he runs in one session of 3 sprints. Since he runs 3 sprints in a session, we multiply the meters per sprint by the number of sprints:
\[ \text{Meters per session} = 60 \, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3 \, \text{sprints} = 180 \, \text{meters} \]

3. Finally, to find out the total meters he runs in a week, we multiply the meters per session by the number of sessions he has per week. Since he runs 3 times a week, we have:
\[ \text{Total meters per week} = 180 \, \text{meters/session} \times 3 \, \text{sessions/week} = 540 \, \text{meters} \]

4,"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups

Since Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for the day is:

3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups

Now, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount needed for the day to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal:

60 cups (total needed) - 40 cups (morning and afternoon) = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

1. Carla starts downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
2. She downloads 40% of the file before the interruption. To find out how much that is, we calculate 40% of 200 GB:
   \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \)
3. This means she has 60% of the file left to download, which is:
   \( 0.60 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \)
4. The interruption takes 20 minutes, during which she downloads no data.
5. After the interruption, she has to restart the download from the beginning, so she will download the full 200 GB again.
6. The total time taken to download the file is the time taken to download the first 80 GB plus the 20-minute interruption plus the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB.

First, let's find out how long it takes to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:
   \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, add the 20-minute interruption:

28,"Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we can subtract the distance to his second stop from the total distance of the trip and then add the distance from his first stop to the end of the trip.

Total distance of the trip = 60 miles
Distance to the second stop = 15 miles

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = Total distance - Distance to the second stop

2. The two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots.
3. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much.

First, let's find out the cost of the second pair of heels. Since it costs twice as much as the first pair, it would be:
2 * $33 = $66

Now, let's find out the total cost of the two pairs of heels together:
$33 (first pair) + $66 (second pair) = $99

We know that the boots cost $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of heels. So, the cost of the boots would be:
$99 (total cost of heels) + $5 = $104

   Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties he bought:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. To find the cost of each red tie, we first calculate the additional cost (50% of the cost of a blue tie):
   Additional cost per red tie = 50% of Cost per blue tie
   Additional cost per red tie = 0.5 * $40
   Additional cost per red tie = $20

   Now, we add this additional cost to the cost of a blue tie to get the cost of a red tie:
   Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + Additional cost per red tie
   Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
   Cost per red tie = $60

4. Finally, to find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
   Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total spent on red ties = $600

5. To find the total amount spent on ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties to the amount spent on red ties:

2. **Cost of Jeweler**: She also paid $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Total Cost Before Insurance**: To find the total cost before insurance, we add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler together.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost Before Insurance} = \text{Cost of Material} + \text{Cost of Jeweler} = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300

62,"Marcy's pension is calculated based on the number of years she works for the company. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the full pension value per year for each additional year she works. Since she works for 30 years, she gets 5% of the full pension for the last 10 years of her service.

First, let's calculate the value of the pension for the last 10 years of her service:
5% of $50,000/year = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500/year

Now, let's calculate the total pension she would have received if she worked for 40 years:
$50,000/year * 40 years = $2,000,000

Since she only worked for 30 years, we need to subtract the value of the pension for the last 10 years from the total pension:
$2,000,000 - ($2,500/year * 10 years) = $2,000,000 - $25,000 = $1,975,000

Finally, we divide this amount by the number of years she worked to find her annual pension:

\[ \text{Total for first half} = 6 \times 140 = 840 \]

For the second half of the year, she was charged 10% less than the initial amount. So, the reduced monthly charge is:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly charge} = 140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]

The total amount for the second half of the year is:
\[ \text{Total for second half} = 6 \times 126 = 756 \]

Now, to find the total amount paid for the entire year, we add the totals for both halves:
\[ \text{Total for the year} = \text{Total for first half} + \text{Total for second half} \]
\[ \text{Total for the year} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

2. Lee used to be able to run the hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee's time is 38 seconds, Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
3. Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much faster he can run now, we calculate 10% of his original time: 10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.
4. Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles 4 seconds faster than his original time. So, his new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

97,"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the volume of the tomatoes is halved when they are cooked into sauce. This means that the volume of the sauce is twice the volume of the tomatoes used.

Given that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, we can find the volume of the tomatoes used by dividing the volume of the sauce by 2:

\[ \text{Volume of tomatoes} = \frac{\text{Volume of sauce}}{2} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{2} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. Since Freda used 16 ounces of tomatoes, we can find the number of tomatoes used by dividing the volume of tomatoes by the volume per can:

\[ \text{Number of tomatoes} = \frac{\text{Volume of tomatoes}}{\text{Volume per can}} = \frac{16 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 1 \text{ can} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ \text{Total number of tomatoes} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Tomatoes per can} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used $\boxed{3}$ tomatoes.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

Since these 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, they must have been part of the original 25 cars that were left after the 5 cars took the exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that could have driven through minus the 20 that drove through in the last 15 minutes.

The volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. However, since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

For one box:
- Length (L) = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width (W) = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height (H) = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The volume (V) of one box is:
V = L * W * H
V = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
V = 24 cubic inches

Now, to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

From the first statement, we can write the equation:
B + 6B = 1800

   Lylah's salary = $30,769.23 (approximately)

3. **Adrien's salary four years later**: Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, we calculate the increase and add it to his initial salary:

   Increase = $40,000 * 0.40
   Increase = $16,000
   Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's initial salary + Increase
   Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + $16,000
   Adrien's salary four years later = $56,000

4. **Lylah's salary four years later**: Since Lylah's salary also increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we assume the same percentage increase for Lylah's salary:
   Lylah's salary four years later = Lylah's initial salary + (Lylah's initial salary * 40%)
   Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.40)

2. For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less each day than Monday. So, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each of those days.
3. For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each of those days.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 hours each day, so 6 + 6 = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 7 hours each day, so 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 hours

Adding all these up, we get the total hours she slept:

8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 28 (Thursday to Sunday) = 48 hours

So, the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week is 48 hours.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet to match the units of speed given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance = 3 miles
- Conversion to feet = $3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}$

For Tim:
- Distance = 2 miles
- Conversion to feet = $2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}$

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their homes.

For Steve:
- Time = Distance / Speed = $15840 \text{ feet} / 440 \text{ feet/minute} = 36 \text{ minutes}$

For Tim:
- Time = Distance / Speed = $10560 \text{ feet} / 264 \text{ feet/minute} = 40 \text{ minutes}$

Comparing the times, we see that Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes, while Tim takes 40 minutes. Therefore, Tim is the loser and has to wait for Steve to finish.

The time Tim has to wait is the difference between his time and Steve's time:
- Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = $40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}$

So, Tim will be waiting for 4 minutes at his house before Steve finishes the race.

155,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of all the baked goods in inches and then convert that to feet.

1. Calculate the total length of the rolls:
   - Each roll is 4 inches long, and there are 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

2. Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long, and there are 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

3. Calculate the total length of the baguettes:
   - Each baguette is two feet long, and there are 60 baguettes.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is 24 inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

4. Add the total lengths of all the baked goods to get the total length in inches:
   - Total length in inches = 1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

5. Convert the total length from inches to feet:
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

162,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the compounded growth of the price over 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

1. **Calculate the number of price increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we divide the total number of months by the interval between price increases:
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/price increase}} = 18 \text{ price increases}
   \]

2. **Calculate the growth factor**: Each price increase is by 20%, which can be expressed as a growth factor of 1.20 (or 120% of the original price). Since there are 18 price increases, the total growth factor is:
   \[
   \text{Total growth factor} = 1.20^{18}
   \]

3. **Calculate the final price**: The final price is the original price multiplied by the total growth factor:
   \[
   \text{Final price} = 20 \times 1.20^{18}

   J = M + 2

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age. Two years ago, Jean would have been J - 2 years old, and Mark would have been M - 2 years old. So we can write:
   M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5

3. We are given that Jean is currently 30 years old, so J = 30. We can substitute this value into the equations to find Mark's age.

From the first equation:

   M - 2 = (1/2)(J - 2) + 5
   28 - 2 = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5
   26 = 14 + 5
   26 = 19

This is still incorrect because we are not accounting for the fact that two years ago, Jean was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. So the correct interpretation of the second equation should be:
   M - 2 = (1/2)(28) + 5
   28 - 2 = 14 + 5

This is still incorrect because we are not accounting for the fact that two years ago, Jean was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. So the correct interpretation of the second equation should be:

For the well-rounded team, each member runs their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by this team is:
\[ 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by this team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the well-rounded team from the total time of the less well-rounded team:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

184,"To solve this, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then find the difference between them, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (4 or 6):**
   There are 2 favorable outcomes (4 and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   P(>3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
   P(>3) = 2/6
   P(>3) = 1/3

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The probability of rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6) on the first roll is 3/6 or 1/2. Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.
   P(Even-Even) = P(Even on first roll) * P(Even on second roll)
   P(Even-Even) = (1/2) * (1/2)
   P(Even-Even) = 1/4

3. **Difference in probabilities and expressing it as a percentage:**
   Difference = P(>3) - P(Even-Even)
   Difference = (1/3) - (1/4)
   To find the common denominator, we can use 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4).
   Difference = (4/12) - (3/12)
   Difference = 1/12

   To express this as a percentage:

1. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages with an equal number of rats in each cage. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as $r$.

2. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is $3r \times 6$.

3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is $10 \times 5$.

4. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

5. The total number of straw pieces distributed among all the small rodents is 160.

Now, let's set up the equation based on the information given:

\[3r \times 6 + 10 \times 5 + 20 = 160\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[18r + 50 + 20 = 160\]

\[18r + 70 = 160\]

Subtracting 70 from both sides:

\[18r = 90\]

187,"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we'll use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case:
P = $100 (the initial amount Mandy owes)
r = 2% per month = 0.02 (as a decimal)
n = 1 (since interest is compounded monthly)
t = 3 months

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

A = 100(1 + 0.02/1)^(1*3)
A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3
A = 100(1.02)^3
A = 100 * 1.061208

   \]

2. **Food Cost**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the food cost is:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, so she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, so she collected 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she has collected over the three months:

Initial cards: 20
First month: 60
Second month: 40
Third month: 200

Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

199,"Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
500 sentences * $0.05/sentence = $25

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so the rate per sentence is:
2 * $0.05/sentence = $0.10/sentence

For 500 sentences, Mark earns from Publisher B:
500 sentences * $0.10/sentence = $50

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
$25 (from Publisher A) + $50 (from Publisher B) = $75

Therefore, Mark makes $75 in a week.

201,"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

Annual Salary = Weekly Salary × Number of Weeks
Annual Salary = $2000 × 52
Annual Salary = $104,000

Next, we calculate the 5% raise on his annual salary:

Raise = Annual Salary × Raise Percentage
Raise = $104,000 × 0.05
Raise = $5,200

Now, we add the raise to his annual salary to find his new annual salary:

New Annual Salary = Annual Salary + Raise
New Annual Salary = $104,000 + $5,200
New Annual Salary = $109,200

Finally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his new annual salary to find the total amount of money he made that year:

1. First, we find out the total production of grapes per acre. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, we can calculate this as:
   Total production per acre = 5 tons/acre

2. Next, we need to find out the total production of grapes for the entire 10-acre farm. We can do this by multiplying the production per acre by the total number of acres:
   Total production for the farm = Total production per acre * Total acres
   Total production for the farm = 5 tons/acre * 10 acres
   Total production for the farm = 50 tons

3. Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, to find out the total number of barrels produced from the farm's grape production, we multiply the total production of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:
   Total barrels of wine = Total production for the farm * Barrels per ton

Weight of a candied apple = Weight of a chocolate bar / 2
Weight of a candied apple = 40g / 2
Weight of a candied apple = 20g

Now that we know the weight of each candied apple, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples in Joe's bag:

Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples * Weight of each candied apple
Total weight of candied apples = 80 * 20g
Total weight of candied apples = 1600g

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars in Joe's bag:

Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars * Weight of each chocolate bar
Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 * 40g
Total weight of chocolate bars = 1000g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

Total weight of Joe's bag of candy = Total weight of chocolate bars + Total weight of candied apples

3. The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost for the cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

4. Now, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups. So, the cost per cup is $16800 / 240 = $70.

214,"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( x \) gallons. Therefore, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons at that time.

Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( x + 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( 2x + 16 \) gallons.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 16 = 4(x + 16) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:

   \[
   \text{Additional amount} = 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200

   Adrian's age = 3 * 21
   Adrian's age = 63 years

3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. So, Zack's current age is:
   Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
   Zack's age = 2 * 21
   Zack's age = 42 years

4. To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to calculate their ages in three years:

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the following equation:

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

38 = 4F

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for F:

F = 38 / 4
F = 9.5

However, since we cannot have half a fish, we must have made a mistake in our interpretation. The difference in the number of snails is not twice the number of fish in both aquariums, but twice the number of fish in one aquarium. So the correct equation should be:

|4 - 32| = 2 * F

Now, solve for F:

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each of them.

**Sue's total calories:**
- Monday: 20 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 4000 calories

2. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are an equal number of boys and girls in the school:
   Total boys = Total girls = Total students / 2 = 60 students / 2 = 30 boys and 30 girls

3. The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
   Boys in first class = Total students in first class - Girls in first class

From point 2, we can express the number of wolves Rick killed today as 3 times the number of cougars he killed today. Let's call the number of cougars he killed today ""C"". So, the number of wolves he killed today is 3C.

From point 3, we know that the number of cougars he killed today is 3 fewer than the 15 cougars he killed last night. So, C = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now we can find out how many wolves he killed today: 3C = 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals killed last night to the animals killed today:

Wolves last night: 10

1. **Solo Song**: The solo song has 54 lines. Since all of these are Sean's lines, he has to memorize 54 lines for the song.

2. **First Scene**: The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. So, the total number of lines in the first scene is 54 * 2 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's. Therefore, Sean has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines for the first scene.

3. **Second Scene**: The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. So, the total number of lines in the second scene is 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. Therefore, Sean has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Song: 54 lines

1. **Calculating the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we divide the total desired cooling by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
   Number of ice cubes = Total cooling / Cooling per ice cube
   Number of ice cubes = 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube
   Number of ice cubes = 5

2. **Calculating the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since she uses 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:
   Weakening by ice cubes = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
   Weakening by ice cubes = 5 * 12 milliliters
   Weakening by ice cubes = 60 milliliters

3. **Calculating the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Since the problem doesn't specify a weakening factor for the cream, we'll assume it's the same as the ice cubes for simplicity (12 milliliters per milliliter of added liquid):
   Weakening by cream = Amount of cream * Weakening per milliliter of added liquid
   Weakening by cream = 15 milliliters * 12 milliliters per milliliter
   Weakening by cream = 180 milliliters

4. **Calculating the total weakening effect:**
   To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream:

338,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as $x$. Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, it will have $x - 10$ students.

The total number of students in the class is 200, and this total is the sum of the students in all three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[2x + (x - 10) = 200\]

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms:

\[3x - 10 = 200\]

Adding 10 to both sides to isolate the term with $x$:

\[3x = 210\]

Dividing both sides by 3 to solve for $x$:

\[x = 70\]

Since $x$ represents the number of students in each of the two equal groups, and the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of these groups, the number of students in the smallest group is:

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Etching Cost:**
   - The etching adds an additional 20% to the cost of each frame.
   - The additional cost per frame is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - So, the total etching cost is 44 * $4 = $176.

- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is borrowed for, in years.

Given:
- \( P = $3,650 \),
- \( r = 10\% = 0.10 \) (as a decimal),
- \( t = 5 \) months, which is \( \frac{5}{12} \) years.

First, we calculate the total interest:

Daily energy consumption = Power rating of AC * Hours used per day
                         = 900 watts * 8 hours
                         = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Now, let's find out how much energy he will save by reducing the usage by 5 hours a day:

Energy saved per day = Power rating of AC * Hours reduced per day
                     = 900 watts * 5 hours
                     = 4500 watt-hours (Wh)

Next, we'll calculate the total energy saved over 30 days:

Total energy saved = Energy saved per day * Number of days
                   = 4500 Wh * 30 days
                   = 135000 Wh

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts (W), we need to convert the total energy saved from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh) to get the final result:

Total energy saved in kWh = Total energy saved in Wh / 1000
                          = 135000 Wh / 1000

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we know that each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Next, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost will be:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00 for meat

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost will be:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00 for cheese

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese together to find the total amount Tyson will spend:

3. He took another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, let's find out how many steps Elliott had taken before his jog:

Steps taken before jog = Steps to/from school + Steps with friend
= 5,000 + 1,000
= 6,000 steps

Now, let's calculate the total steps Elliott had taken after his jog:

Total steps after jog = Steps before jog + Steps during jog

We know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. So, the total steps he had taken after his jog is:

Total steps after jog = 10,000 - 2,000
= 8,000 steps

Now we can find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog:

Steps during jog = Total steps after jog - Steps before jog

431,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy and then subtract the amount of money she already has.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = Cost of skipping rope + Cost of board game + Cost of playground ball
Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2
Total cost = $19

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = Money saved + Money given by mother
Total money Dora has = $2 + $16
Total money Dora has = $18

Now, we find out how much more money Dora needs by subtracting the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18
Money needed = $1

Therefore, Dora needs an additional $\boxed{1}$ dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

433,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find out how many gallons of gas are in one container. Since 15 gallons are equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

2. Next, we need to convert gallons to pints because the question asks for the answer in pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, we multiply the gallons in one container by 8 to get the pints:
\[ 3 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 24 \text{ pints} \]

3. Finally, Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. So, we divide the pints in one container by 4 to find out how many pints Josey needs:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pints}}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needs $\boxed{6}$ pints of gasoline.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5, which is:

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

440,"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is $3 \times 3 = 9$ feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ \text{Width} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \]

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, the temperature increase over 3 hours is:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

Hay eaten = Distance × Hay per mile
Hay eaten = 16 miles × 0.5 bails/mile
Hay eaten = 8 bails

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so for 8 bails:

Total cost of hay = Number of bails × Cost per bail
Total cost of hay = 8 bails × $3/bail
Total cost of hay = $24

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:

Total money = Number of bills × Value per bill
Total money = 6 bills × $5/bill
Total money = $30

Finally, to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the total money he has:

For one raised bed:

\[ V = 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \]

First, let's convert the height of the cheerleaders from inches to feet, since the final result should be in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- 64 inches is equal to \( \frac{64}{12} \) feet.
- 60 inches is equal to \( \frac{60}{12} \) feet.

Now, let's calculate the height of the pyramid:

1. The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall, so their combined height is \( 4 \times \frac{64}{12} \) feet.
2. The second layer has 3 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall, so their combined height is \( 3 \times \frac{64}{12} \) feet.
3. The third layer has 2 cheerleaders, each 64"" tall, so their combined height is \( 2 \times \frac{64}{12} \) feet.
4. The top layer has 1 cheerleader, who is 60"" tall, so her height is \( \frac{60}{12} \) feet.

Adding these together, the total height of the pyramid is:

1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:
   H + L = 120,000

2. The house costs three times as much as the lot:
   H = 3L

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for L:

   3L + L = 120,000
   4L = 120,000
   L = 120,000 / 4
   L = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:

8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $4/bag = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags at the craft fair. She sold each bag for $8, and since she had 8 packs of 5 bags, the total number of bags is:

8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags

So, the total revenue from selling the bags is:

40 bags * $8/bag = $320

Ada's weekly consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days
Ada's weekly consumption = 84 kilowatts per week

Now, let's calculate her weekly bill before adding the new device:

Ada's weekly bill = Ada's weekly consumption * cost per kilowatt per hour
Ada's weekly bill = 84 kilowatts per week * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour
Ada's weekly bill = $126.00 per week

Next, we'll calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device:

   Chairs (Ophelia) = 20 + 2
   Chairs (Ophelia) = 22

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3:
   Chairs (Jenna) = 3 * Chairs (Ophelia)
   Chairs (Jenna) = 3 * 22
   Chairs (Jenna) = 66

3. Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas she has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs she has:
   Sofas (Jenna) = Chairs (Jenna) - 2
   Sofas (Jenna) = 66 - 2
   Sofas (Jenna) = 64

4. Now, to find the total number of sofas and chairs they have, we add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

546,"To solve this problem, let's break down Elise's writing process into steps:

1. **First Full Alphabet**: Elise writes the entire alphabet once. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, this step accounts for $26$ letters.

2. **Second Full Alphabet**: Elise writes the entire alphabet again. This adds another $26$ letters to her total.

3. **Half of the Alphabet**: Elise then writes half of the alphabet. Half of 26 is $13$, so this step adds $13$ letters to her total.

4. **Rewriting Everything**: Finally, Elise rewrites everything she has written so far. This means she writes the entire alphabet twice and half of it once again. This step adds $26 + 26 + 13 = 65$ letters to her total.

To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add up all the letters from each step:

- From the first full alphabet: $26$ letters
- From the second full alphabet: $26$ letters
- From half of the alphabet: $13$ letters
- From rewriting everything: $65$ letters

Adding these together, we get $26 + 26 + 13 + 65 = 130$ letters.

1. Diane starts with a number, which we'll call N. The starting value is 20, so N = 20.

2. She adds half of this number to the starting value:
   Half of N is N/2, so half of 20 is 20/2 = 10.
   Adding this to the starting value gives us 20 + 10 = 30.

3. She then divides this sum by 5:
   30 divided by 5 is 30/5 = 6.

4. Next, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12:

580,"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, which is 18 degrees more than the set temperature.

The percentage error can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to calculate the temperature that would be 4% hotter than 520 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set the oven to as \( T \). We can set up the equation as follows:

Pete buys 2 boxes, so the total cost for the 2 boxes will be:

2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes will contain:

Total pumps = Number of washings / Pumps per washing
Total pumps = 120 / 2
Total pumps = 60 pumps

Now, we know the cost of the jumbo bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump in cents, we convert the dollars to cents (since there are 100 cents in a dollar) and then divide by the total number of pumps:

Cost per pump in cents = (Cost in dollars * 100 cents/dollar) / Total pumps
Cost per pump in cents = (24 * 100) / 60
Cost per pump in cents = 2400 / 60
Cost per pump in cents = 40 cents

608,"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount:

Cost of shirt = $25
Cost of shorts = $35
Total cost before discount = $25 + $35 = $60

Now, let's apply the 30% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 30% of $60 = 0.30 * $60 = $18

Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to get the total cost after discount:

Total cost after discount = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the total cost. Now, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase:

Money Joe has = $50
Total cost after discount = $42

Money left after purchase = Money Joe has - Total cost after discount
Money left after purchase = $50 - $42 = $8

1. **Initial Funding**: John starts with $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Duration**: His research takes 10 times longer than initially planned, so it lasts for 50 months (5 months * 10).

3. **Increased Funding**: Every month after the first 5 months, the funding increases by 50%. This means that for each of the remaining 45 months, the funding is 1.5 times the initial monthly funding.

First, let's calculate the total funding for the first 5 months:
Initial funding for 5 months = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the increased funding for the remaining 45 months. Since the initial monthly funding is $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month, the increased funding per month is:
Increased funding per month = $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000

639,"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which in this case is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length \( L = 6 \) feet
- Width \( W = 4 \) feet
- Depth \( D = 3 \) feet

The volume of the hole is:
\[ V = L \times W \times D = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that Bob can shovel 1 cubic foot of earth in 3 seconds. To find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we divide the total volume by the rate at which he can shovel:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{72 \text{ cubic feet}}{1 \text{ cubic foot/3 seconds}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \times 3 \text{ seconds} \]

Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. He has 24 feet of soil to dig through. So, the time (T_soil) it takes to dig through the soil is:
T_soil = Distance / Speed
T_soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour

First, let's find out how many deviled egg halves Lori will need for her 16 guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we multiply the number of guests by the number of halves per guest:

Number of halves needed = Number of guests × Halves per guest
Number of halves needed = 16 guests × 3 halves/guest
Number of halves needed = 48 halves

Now, we know that Lori needs 48 deviled egg halves in total. Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find out how many whole eggs Lori will need by dividing the total number of halves by 2:

Number of eggs needed = Total halves needed ÷ Halves per egg
Number of eggs needed = 48 halves ÷ 2 halves/egg
Number of eggs needed = 24 eggs

Finally, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

669,"To calculate the total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first find out how much of each ingredient is needed for one muffin and then multiply by the number of muffins.

For flour:
- 1 muffin requires 5 tablespoons of flour.
- For 16 muffins, the total amount of flour needed is \(5 \text{ tbsp/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 80 \text{ tbsp}\).

For sugar:
- 1 muffin requires 3 tablespoons of sugar.
- For 16 muffins, the total amount of sugar needed is \(3 \text{ tbsp/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 48 \text{ tbsp}\).

For salt:
- 1 muffin requires 0.25 tablespoons of salt.
- For 16 muffins, the total amount of salt needed is \(0.25 \text{ tbsp/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 4 \text{ tbsp}\).

Now, we add up all the dry ingredients to find the total amount needed:
- Total dry ingredients = Flour + Sugar + Salt
- Total dry ingredients = \(80 \text{ tbsp} + 48 \text{ tbsp} + 4 \text{ tbsp} = 132 \text{ tbsp}\).

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. Together, Gissela, Gordy, and Gary can haul 11,600 pounds of gravel.

To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity when all three trucks are together:

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)

705,"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the relationship between the cat's speed and the turtle's speed. Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, we can express the turtle's speed as a fraction of the cat's speed. Let's denote the turtle's speed as $T$ feet/second. Then, we have:

\[T = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{cat's speed}\]

Given that the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the turtle's speed:

\[T = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \text{ feet/second}\]

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time:

\[\text{Distance} = T \times \text{time}\]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time, we get:

\[\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}\]

Now, let's apply the deal. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for the first 2 scoops, she only pays for 1 (since the second one is free). This leaves her with 3 scoops to pay for (since she has 4 scoops in total).

The cost for the 3 scoops she has to pay for is 3 scoops * $1.50 per scoop = $4.50.

Erin has $6.00, so after buying the 3 scoops, she has $6.00 - $4.50 = $1.50 left.

1. Let the number of cases needed for the second house be \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the first house needs half the amount of the second house, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.
4. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we can write the equation: \( \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \).
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: \( \frac{3}{2}x = 250 \).
6. To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \): \( x = 250 \times \frac{2}{3} \).
7. Calculating the right side, we get: \( x = 166.67 \) (approximately).

However, since we can't have a fraction of a case of shingles, we need to adjust our approach. Let's assume that the number of cases for the second house is a whole number, say \( y \). Then the first house would need \( \frac{1}{2}y \) cases, and the third house would need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}y = y \) cases. The total would be \( \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{5}{2}y = 250 \). Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = 100 \).

So, the third house will need \( 100 \) cases of shingles.

Ahmed's books = Ezra's books / 2
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know Ezra wants to read 150 more books after the initial 300, so we add those to his total:

Ezra's additional books = 150
Ezra's total books = Ezra's initial books + Ezra's additional books
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

Regular daily earnings = Hourly rate * Hours worked
= $20/hour * 8 hours

- There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students.
- So, the total number of students in the school is $40 \times 25 = 1000$ students.
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is $1000 \times 1 = 1000$ trees.

Now that we know the students raised a total of $125,000, we can find out how much each student raised by dividing this amount by the number of students:

Amount raised per student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised per student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised per student = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.

820,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which means she walked for 8 / 2 = 4 hours from Holloway Shores to Hollock Valley Shores.

Now, let's calculate the total time she walked in hours and then convert it to minutes:

Total time in hours = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
Total time in hours = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time in hours = 12 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total time in minutes = Total time in hours * 60
Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time in minutes = 720 minutes

1. Weight-based charge:
The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, the weight-based charge is:
4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

2. Distance-based charge:
The distribution center is 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, the distance-based charge is:
20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

3. Total shipping cost:
Now, we add the weight-based charge and the distance-based charge to get the total shipping cost:
$1.40 (weight-based) + $1.60 (distance-based) = $3.00

4. Amazon's refund:
Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which was $32. So, the refund amount is:
75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

5. Net loss:

1. Time spent recording TikTok videos:
   - She records 18 videos per week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, the time spent on videos per week is 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.

2. Time spent writing songs:
   - She spends 2 hours per week writing songs.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time spent on songs per week is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

3. Time spent doing makeup:
   - She does her makeup for 15 minutes six days a week.
   - So, the time spent on makeup per week is 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons
Number of floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Finally, to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

First, let's calculate the total cost without the discount for 3 baskets of each color:

- For green food: 3 baskets * $25/basket = $75
- For red food: 3 baskets * $18/basket = $54

Now, let's apply the discount for the red food baskets:

- Discount for red food: 3 baskets * $2/discount = $6

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost of the red food baskets and add it to the total cost of the green food baskets to get the final total:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed for all students:
   Total glue sticks needed = Number of students × Glue sticks per student
   = 27 students × 2 glue sticks
   = 54 glue sticks

2. Determine how many packs of glue sticks are needed to meet this requirement:
   Since each pack contains 8 glue sticks, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:
   Packs needed = Total glue sticks needed ÷ Glue sticks per pack
   = 54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks per pack
   = 6.75 packs

3. Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number:

4. To find out how many extra glue sticks he will have, we calculate the remainder:
   Extra glue sticks = (Total glue sticks needed ÷ Glue sticks per pack) - Packs needed

880,"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah's friend wants to buy it for. Since the rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, the total cost is:

Total cost = Length of rope × Cost per meter
Total cost = 20 meters × $2/meter
Total cost = $40

Next, we need to determine Sarah's profit from selling the rope. Since she bought the rope for $1.5 per meter, her profit per meter is:

Profit per meter = Selling price per meter - Buying price per meter
Profit per meter = $2/meter - $1.5/meter
Profit per meter = $0.5/meter

Now, let's calculate her total profit from selling the 20-meter rope:

Total profit = Profit per meter × Length of rope
Total profit = $0.5/meter × 20 meters
Total profit = $10

Finally, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, so for a 20-meter rope, the cost would be:

Cost of new rope = Length of new rope × Cost per meter of new rope
Cost of new rope = 20 meters × $1.5/meter
Cost of new rope = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from her total profit to find out how much money she has left over:

Money left over = Total profit - Cost of new rope
Money left over = $10 - $30
Money left over = -$20

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money left over, this means that Sarah does not have enough profit to buy the new rope. She would need to spend an additional $20 to purchase the new rope.

1. Bacon: 5 packs at $10 in total, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.
2. Chicken: 6 packets, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs 2 * $2 = $4. The total cost for chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.
3. Strawberries: 3 packs at $4 each, so the total cost for strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.
4. Apples: 7 packs, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost for apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart:

Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14
Total cost = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

First, let's find the total revenue:
- Each student sold 10 lollipops.
- There are 30 students.
- Each lollipop is sold for $0.8.

Total revenue = Number of students × Number of lollipops sold per student × Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student × $0.8/lollipop
Total revenue = 30 × 10 × 0.8

3. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Since there are 9 cups in each row, and she wants equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, she will have 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we can't have half a cup of tea, we need to adjust our calculation. Lana can't have half cups of tea, so she must be dividing the cups into whole numbers. This means that the number of cups in each row must be a multiple of 4 (since 4.5 is not a whole number and we can't have half cups of tea).

Let's find the nearest multiple of 4 that is less than 9, which is 8. So, each row must have 8 cups. This means Lana has 3 rows of 8 cups each, totaling 3 * 8 = 24 cups.

Now, we know Lana has 27 cups in total and she has used 24 cups for chamomile and mint tea. This leaves her with 27 - 24 = 3 cups for cinnamon tea, which matches the given information that she brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea (since 3 cups are used in each row for cinnamon tea, and there are 3 rows).

942,"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

1. **Visit Fee**: This is a flat rate of $40 for visiting the house to make a repair.

2. **Labor Cost**: The labor cost is $35 per hour, and since the job took 2.25 hours, we calculate the labor cost as follows:
   Labor Cost = Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
   Labor Cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours
   Labor Cost = $79.375

   Since labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we round up to the nearest whole hour. Therefore, the labor cost is $80 (rounded up from 2.25 hours).

3. **Parts Cost**: The parts used for the job cost $60.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total charge:

Total Charge = Visit Fee + Labor Cost + Parts Cost
Total Charge = $40 + $80 + $60
Total Charge = $180

Therefore, Patty charged a total of ###180 for the job.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}

\[10 \times 15 = \$150\]

Next, we calculate the discount he gets on the CDs. The CDs are 40% off, so the discount amount is:
\[150 \times 0.40 = \$60\]

Now, let's find out how much James pays for the CDs after the discount:
\[150 - 60 = \$90\]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these CDs is:
\[5 \times 40 = \$200\]

However, since he only paid $90 for the CDs, he cannot make a profit by selling them for $40 each. In fact, he would be selling them at a loss. The loss he incurs from selling 5 CDs is:
\[200 - 90 = \$110\]

Therefore, James is out $110 from selling the 5 CDs.

Total commission from NYT = 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the commission from the sales of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15.
Commission per copy = 8/100 * $15 = $1.20

Since he sells 10 copies, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
Total commission from WSJ = 10 * $1.20 = $12.00

Finally, to find the total commission Cayley earns, we add the commissions from both newspapers:

1. Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours or 480 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

2. On the day in question, she started sleepwalking at 2:15 a.m. and stopped at 2:38 a.m. The duration of her sleepwalking is 23 minutes (from 2:15 to 2:38).

3. She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, which means she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she was awake for an additional 5 minutes before her usual wake-up time.

Now, let's calculate the total time she spent on her bed:

- Total usual sleep time: 480 minutes
- Time spent sleepwalking: -23 minutes (since this time is not spent sleeping on her bed)
- Time awake earlier than usual: -5 minutes

Total sleep on bed = Total usual sleep time - Time spent sleepwalking - Time awake earlier than usual

= 1000 * (4/5)
= 800 beds

Next, we need to calculate the total number of beds occupied by new patients after 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks is:

New patients in 2 weeks = Patients per day * Number of days

Since the number of people can't be a fraction, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down because you can't have a fraction of a person at a concert.

Now, subtract this number from Courtney's reported number:

We also know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:

S + (S + 5) + (4A - 13) = 339

Combining like terms, we get:

Now, we need to express A in terms of S using the second piece of information:

S = 4A - 13

Substitute S in the first equation:

Dictionary: $18
Dinosaur book: $13
Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more he needs to save, we subtract his savings from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Savings
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, if we let the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday be x, then on Saturday, he sold x - 4 boxes of apple pie.
3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day:

- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, which is 10 * $6 = $60.
- On Saturday, he sold x - 4 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, which is (x - 4) * $15.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, which is 15 * $6 = $90.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, which is 15 * $15 = $225.

Now, let's add up the earnings for both days:

Total earnings = (Saturday gingerbread + Saturday apple pie) + (Sunday gingerbread + Sunday apple pie)
Total earnings = ($60 + (x - 4) * $15) + ($90 + $225)

Since we know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, we can find the value of x:

x - 4 = 15
x = 15 + 4
x = 19

Now we can calculate the total earnings:

Total earnings = ($60 + (19 - 4) * $15) + ($90 + $225)
Total earnings = ($60 + 15 * $15) + ($90 + $225)

Now, we subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - Cheaper amount
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

2. **Calculate the total number of flowers needed** to fill the flower bed. We know that each flower grows 12 inches wide and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. So, the space needed for each plant including the gap is 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches. To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space needed for each plant: 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she will need 45 plants in total.

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since the Comet appears every 75 years, we can calculate the time difference between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing it for the first time.

Bill's dad saw the Comet at 30 years old, and Bill saw it for the second time when he was three times that age (3 * 30 = 90 years old). The difference in age between when Bill saw the Comet for the second time and when his dad saw it is 90 - 30 = 60 years.

Since the Comet appears every 75 years, and it took 60 years for Bill to see it for the second time after his dad saw it, we can calculate the age at which Bill saw it for the first time by subtracting 60 years from the 75-year orbit period:

First, let's find the average age of the group using the total age and the number of children:
Average age = $\frac{A + B + H + W}{4}$

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can write:

Now, let's substitute the known values of $A$ and $B$ into the equation for the total age:
$3 + 4 + H + W = 20$

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to calculate the fraction of the total watermelon that the adults receive and then convert that fraction to a percentage. Since each adult gets $2$ slices, the total slices for the adults is $2 \times 2 = 4$ slices.

\[10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, let's convert the minutes spent on rounds and appointments into hours, since the total time at the clinic is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[180 \text{ minutes} = \frac{180}{60} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}\]
\[300 \text{ minutes} = \frac{300}{60} \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}\]

Adding the time spent on rounds and appointments gives us the total time Doctor Jones will spend on these activities:
\[3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Subtracting the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time gives us the time left for updating records:
\[9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}\]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the studio rental:
Weekly studio rental cost = $25 per session * 3 sessions per week = $75 per week

Next, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the students:
Weekly student earnings = $1.50 per student per session * 10 students * 3 sessions per week = $45 per week

Now, let's add these two weekly earnings to find the total weekly earnings:
Total weekly earnings = Weekly studio rental cost + Weekly student earnings
Total weekly earnings = $75 + $45 = $120 per week

Finally, to find the monthly earnings, we multiply the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
Monthly earnings = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks per month
Monthly earnings = $120 * 4 = $480

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * Total population
Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50
Number of female porcupines = 30

Now, let's calculate how many babies are born each month. Each of the 30 female porcupines gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the monthly increase in population is:

Monthly increase = Number of female porcupines * Babies per female
Monthly increase = 30 * 4
Monthly increase = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total increase in population over a year is:

Annual increase = Monthly increase * Months per year
Annual increase = 120 * 12
Annual increase = 1440

Finally, to find the total population after a year, we add the annual increase to the original population:

Total population after a year = Original population + Annual increase

Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons because the cost is given in gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48052 gallons. So, the volume in gallons is:

Volume in gallons = Volume in cubic feet × Conversion factor
Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 7.48052 gallons/cubic foot
Volume in gallons ≈ 10472.728 gallons

Now, we need to calculate how many gallons of water are needed to fill the pool. The pool company's formula is to multiply the volume by 5.9:

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

**Total pumped on the first day:**
Wanda + Ms. B = 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for the remaining $2000 at a rate of 10% per month. To do this, we multiply the remaining amount by the monthly interest rate:

Monthly payment = Remaining amount * Monthly interest rate
Monthly payment = $2000 * 10%
Monthly payment = $2000 * 0.10
Monthly payment = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

1029,"Let's calculate this step by step:

1. **Red Balloons**: Sally started with 25 red balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of them to burst.
   - 40% of 25 is (40/100) * 25 = 10 balloons.
   - So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

2. **Yellow Balloons**: Sally accidentally released half of the 12 yellow balloons.
   - Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6 balloons.
   - So, she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

3. **Blue Balloons**: Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her clutch.
   - 75% of 8 is (75/100) * 8 = 6 balloons.
   - So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

4. **Total Balloons**: Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:
   - Red balloons: 15
   - Yellow balloons: 6
   - Blue balloons: 6
   - Total = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons

1030,"To calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the scenarios where he won't have to turn it in and subtract that from 100%.

1. The probability that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework is 50% or 0.5.
2. The probability that the normal teacher will come in and give everyone an extension is 40% or 0.4.
3. The probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension is 20% or 0.2.

First, we calculate the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher or an extension for the whole class:

P(No homework due to substitute or class extension) = P(Substitute) + P(Class extension)
= 0.5 + 0.4
= 0.9

However, these two events are not mutually exclusive, meaning they can both happen at the same time (a substitute teacher could also give an extension). Since we've already added them together, we don't need to adjust for this overlap.

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework due to a personal extension, assuming the normal teacher is present and no class extension is given:

P(No homework due to personal extension) = P(No substitute) * P(No class extension) * P(Personal extension)
= (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.4) * 0.2
= 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2
= 0.06

Now, we add the probabilities of not having to turn in homework due to a substitute teacher or class extension and due to a personal extension:

P(No homework at all) = P(No homework due to substitute or class extension) + P(No homework due to personal extension)
= 0.9 + 0.06
= 0.96

Finally, we subtract this from 1 to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

P(Marcus has to turn in homework) = 1 - P(No homework at all)
= 1 - 0.96
= 0.04

3. Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.

First, we find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:
Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, we multiply the number of large beans by 2:
75 large beans * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean, we divide the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. So, the daily consumption per cat is:
60 grams/meal * 2 meals/day = 120 grams/day

Since she has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all cats is:
120 grams/day/cat * 3 cats = 360 grams/day

Number of big coupons = 2 * Number of small coupons
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700
Number of big coupons = 1400

Next, we calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so we multiply the number of small coupons by the cost per small coupon:

Total cost for small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost per small coupon
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents
Total cost for small coupons = 3500 cents

Similarly, we calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon:

Total cost for big coupons = Number of big coupons * Cost per big coupon
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents

2. **Truck's collection**: The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour. In a 6-hour day, the truck will collect:
   3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

3. **Total collected**: To find out how many bales are left in the field, we need to subtract the total collected by the truck from the total made by the farmer:
   30 bales (farmer's production) - 18 bales (truck's collection) = 12 bales

1088,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Regular School Hours:**
   - John has 6 periods a day, each 40 minutes long.
   - So, in one day, he spends 6 * 40 = 240 minutes in class.
   - Since he goes to school for 5 days a week, his regular school hours are 240 * 5 = 1200 minutes per week.

2. **Extra Classes:**
   - John has 2 extra classes each day, which are also 40 minutes long.
   - So, for the extra classes, he spends 2 * 40 = 80 minutes per day.
   - Over 5 days, this amounts to 80 * 5 = 400 minutes per week.

3. **Extra Learning Time on Weekends:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Since we don't know his total weekly minutes yet, let's call it 'W'.
   - So, for each day, he spends W/16 minutes.
   - Over 2 days, this amounts to 2 * (W/16) = W/8 minutes.

4. **Total Weekly Learning Time:**
   - To find the total, we add his regular school hours, extra classes, and weekend learning time.
   - Total = Regular School Hours + Extra Classes + Weekend Learning Time
   - Total = 1200 + 400 + (W/8)

5. **Finding 'W':**
   - We know that 'W' is the total weekly minutes, which includes all the above components.
   - So, W = 1200 + 400 + (W/8)
   - Solving for W, we get W = 1600 + (W/8)
   - Multiplying both sides by 8 to get rid of the fraction, we get 8W = 12800 + W
   - Subtracting W from both sides, we get 7W = 12800
   - Dividing both sides by 7, we get W = 1828.57 minutes (approximately)

6. **Converting to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.
   - Total hours per week = 1828.57 / 60 ≈ 30.476 hours

**Result:** John spends approximately 30.48 hours a week learning.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. First, we determine the height from which the ball is dropped. Since Nathan drops the ball from the third floor, and each floor is 24 feet high, the initial height (H1) is:
   H1 = 3 floors * 24 feet/floor = 72 feet

2. On the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce (H2) is:
   H2 = H1 * (2/3) = 72 feet * (2/3) = 48 feet

3. On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce (H3) is:

1092,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so half of the meat was left.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they took a quarter of the original amount of meat.
3. After the velociraptors, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is also a quarter of the original amount of meat.

Since the velociraptors and the Allosaurus each ate a quarter of the original amount of meat, together they ate half of the original amount (because 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2). This means that the T-Rex must have eaten the other half of the original amount.

If the remaining 270 kilograms is a quarter of the original amount, then the original amount was 4 times that, which is 270 kg * 4 = 1080 kg.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet each, so their combined area is:
2 walls * (10 feet * 8 feet) = 160 square feet

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet each, so their combined area is:
2 walls * (5 feet * 8 feet) = 80 square feet

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls to get the total area to be painted:
Total area = Area of north and south walls + Area of east and west walls
Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet
Total area = 240 square feet

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint Tony will need. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
Gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon
Gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon
Gallons needed = 12 gallons

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon:
Total cost = Gallons needed * Cost per gallon

4. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken.
5. Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda.

Now, we need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Now that we know the light blinks 51 times per minute, we can calculate how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate:

Time = Total number of blinks / Rate
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies

- 5 female goldfishes

After the purchase, Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies
- 1 female guppy
- 2 male goldfishes
- 3 female goldfishes

Let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes after the purchase:

Total male fishes = Initial male guppies + Additional male guppies + Initial male goldfishes + Additional male goldfishes
Total male fishes = 4 + 2 + 3 + 2
Total male fishes = 11

Total female fishes = Initial female guppies + Additional female guppies + Initial female goldfishes + Additional female goldfishes
Total female fishes = 7 + 1 + 5 + 3
Total female fishes = 16

Now, we find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes:

Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

   Distance = Speed × Time
   Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round-trip distance**: Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to calculate the round-trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by 2.

The first two workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so together they produce:
2 workers * 6 toys/hour/worker = 12 toys/hour

The next two workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so together they produce:
2 workers * 4 toys/hour/worker = 8 toys/hour

Combining the production of the first four workers, we get:
12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they are 20 toys short. This means the total production of all five workers is:
400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys

Now, let's find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. We subtract the total production of the first four workers from the total production of all five workers:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

Elijah's first dog = 1/4 * Kory's dog's weight
Elijah's first dog = 1/4 * 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog = 15 pounds

Next, we calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog:
Elijah's second dog = 1/2 * Kory's dog's weight
Elijah's second dog = 1/2 * 60 pounds
Elijah's second dog = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together to find the total weight:

3. Luis then gave the remaining stickers to Kris. So, Kris received a quarter of Seth's original stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers in total.
5. Since Kris had a quarter of Seth's original stickers, we can find the total number of stickers Seth had by multiplying the number of stickers Kris had by 4 (because a quarter is 1/4, and we want to find the whole).

30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag. To do this, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A + A = 2A.
2. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden's eggs are S + 12.
3. Together, Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs, so S + (S + 12) = 30.

From point 3, we can solve for S:
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 30 - 12
2S = 18
S = 9

Now we know Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted:
9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Arnold painted. We know that Arnold and Madeline together painted 2A eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

Next, we'll determine how many 4-foot logs he can make from the useable length:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{\text{Useable length}}{\text{Log length}} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, let's find out how many planks he can get from each log:

\[ \text{Planks per log} = \frac{\text{Log length}}{\text{Plank length}} = \frac{4 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plank}} = 4 \text{ planks} \]

First, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can calculate the time for 1 mile as follows:

Time for 1 mile on the beach = Total beach time / Distance on the beach

   Adam can buy rocks for $5 each, so with $100, he can buy:
   \[
   \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of his inventory:**
   Adam sells 60% of his 20 rocks, which is:
   \[
   0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]
   Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:
   \[
   12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the rocks:**
   Adam spent $100 to buy the rocks.

4. **Calculate the loss:**
   To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost:

4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree as \(F_{10}\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(F_{10} - 200\) fruits.
5. During the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, so it produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so we can write the following equation:

3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 2 * 4 = 8 goals in the second half.
4. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores 8 * (1/4) = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:

- Team A's total goals = First half goals + Second half goals
  = 4 + 2
  = 6 goals

- Team B's total goals = First half goals + Second half goals
  = 2 + 8
  = 10 goals

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

Total goals = Team A's total goals + Team B's total goals
= 6 + 10
= 16 goals

1176,"Let's calculate this step by step:

1. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. On Monday, he uses 45% of it. To find out how much chalk he used, we calculate 45% of 5 inches:
   \( 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \) inches
3. So, he has used 2.25 inches of chalk, leaving him with:
   \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches of chalk.
4. The teacher decides to use only 20% of the chalk each day from now on. To find out how much chalk he uses each day, we calculate 20% of the remaining chalk:
   \( 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \) inches per day.
5. To find out how many days he can use the chalk before it's smaller than 2 inches, we divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage:
   \( 2.75 \div 0.55 \approx 4.96 \) days.
6. Since the teacher cannot use a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round down to the nearest whole day to ensure he doesn't go below the 2-inch limit. So, he can use the chalk for 4 full days.

Result: The teacher can use the chalk for 4 more days before he has to recycle it.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

- One-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 girls / 3 = 4 girls on varsity.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 boys / 4 = 3 boys on varsity.

Now, let's find out how many students are on varsity in total:

- Total students on varsity = 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is:

- Total students = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students.

To find out how many students are not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

- Students not on varsity = Total students - Students on varsity
- Students not on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17 students not on varsity.

From the first statement, we have:
W = 5 * (C + 7)  [1]

From the second statement, we have:
C + 25 = 1/3 * W  [2]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express W from equation [1] in terms of C:
W = 5C + 35  [3]

Now, we substitute equation [3] into equation [2]:
C + 25 = 1/3 * (5C + 35)

To solve for C, we multiply every term by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Now, we subtract 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:
C = 20

Total books = Total amount / Cost per 100 books
Total books = $27000 / $500
Total books = 54 sets of 100 books
Total books = 5400 books

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends:
Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
\[6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ cheese pizza slices}\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends:
Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
\[6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices}\]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are needed to provide 36 slices. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices needed by the number of slices per cheese pizza:
\[36 \text{ cheese pizza slices} \div 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}\]

Similarly, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are needed to provide 24 slices. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza:
\[24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices} \div 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas}\]

Finally, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas needed to find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy:

1. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. This means he builds 1 snowball every 3 minutes (since 60 minutes / 20 snowballs = 3 minutes per snowball).

2. Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that every hour (which is 4 times 15 minutes), 8 snowballs melt (since 2 snowballs * 4 = 8 snowballs).

3. To find out how many snowballs Jay effectively gains in an hour, we subtract the number of melted snowballs from the number of built snowballs: 20 snowballs built - 8 snowballs melted = 12 snowballs gained per hour.

4. Jay wants to have 60 snowballs. To find out how many hours it will take, we divide the total desired number of snowballs by the number of snowballs gained per hour: 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours.

2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. After using these, they had 12 - 28 = -16 bandages, which is not possible since they can't have a negative number of bandages.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with a side of 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the jar is) is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
   \]
   So, the volume of the jar is:
   \[
   V_{\text{jar}} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}

2. **Calculate the volume of a single jelly bean:**
   The volume of a single jelly bean is given as 0.15 cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar with 80% efficiency:**
   To find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar, we divide the volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean and then multiply by the efficiency factor:
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{V_{\text{jar}}}{V_{\text{jelly bean}}} \times \text{efficiency} = \frac{540}{0.15} \times 0.8 = 2800 \times 0.8 = 2240

5. **Calculate how far off his guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900. So, the difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = |\text{Estimated red jelly beans} - \text{True red jelly beans}| = |672 - 900| = 228

3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, she used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes for the pies.

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes eaten by Madeline, the grapes used by her brother, and the grapes used by their mother:

\[6 \text{ (Madeline's grapes)} + 30 \text{ (brother's grapes)} + 48 \text{ (mother's grapes)} = 84 \text{ grapes}\]

1. There are 82 teachers in total at Rydell Elementary School.
2. On the given day, 13 teachers were sick, so they were not at school.
3. To cover for the sick teachers, 9 substitute teachers were called in.

To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers:

Teachers at school = Total teachers - Sick teachers + Substitute teachers

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Next, we need to convert the custodian's work hours into minutes to compare it with the cleaning time. An 8-hour day is:

8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning by dividing the total cleaning time by the total work time and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

2. The total number of ice cubes is 116:
   S + B = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

Add 4 to both sides:

   6S = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

1269,"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the distance Elvis travels west and the distance he travels east.

1. **Distance traveled west:**
   Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. The distance he covers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Distance west} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   After turning around, Elvis drives east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph. Using the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance east} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance from his house:**
   Since Elvis travels 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, the total distance he is from his house after the eastward journey is the sum of these two distances:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance west} + \text{Distance east} = 90 \, \text{miles} + 144 \, \text{miles} = 234 \, \text{miles}

1270,"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to apply the depreciation percentage to the value of the boat at the end of each year.

1. After the first year, the boat depreciates by 30% of its original value:
   Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700
   Value of the boat after the first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

2. In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% of its value at the end of the first year:
   Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890
   Value of the boat after the second year = Value after the first year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

3. In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of its value at the end of the second year:
   Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882

1. Quarters: Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total value of quarters is:
   32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $8.00

2. Dimes: Each dime is worth $0.10. So, the total value of dimes is:
   95 dimes * $0.10/dime = $9.50

3. Nickels: Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, the total value of nickels is:
   120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00

4. Pennies: Each penny is worth $0.01. So, the total value of pennies is:
   750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

1315,"Let's calculate this step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes in an hour by the time each person takes to peel an orange.

   - Ana's rate: \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges/hour} \)
   - Jane's rate: \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges/hour} \)

2. Now, we can find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour by subtracting Jane's rate from Ana's rate.

   - Difference: \( 20 \text{ oranges/hour} - 15 \text{ oranges/hour} = 5 \text{ oranges/hour} \)

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

1316,"First, let's calculate the discount Mark gets on the new radiator. The radiator costs $400, and he gets an 80% discount on it.

Discount = 80% of $400
          = 0.80 * $400
          = $320

So, the discounted price of the radiator is:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
                 = $400 - $320
                 = $80

Next, let's calculate the cost of hiring a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours.

Labor cost = Hourly rate * Hours worked
           = $50 * 3
           = $150

Finally, let's add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost to find out the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Discounted price + Labor cost
           = $80 + $150
           = $230

1317,"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. We're given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   C + K = 20

2. The total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write:
   2C + 4K = 70

Now, let's solve this system of equations. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   C + 2K = 35

Now we have a simpler system:
   C + K = 20
   C + 2K = 35

Subtract the first equation from the second:
   (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20
   C + 2K - C - K = 15
   K = 15

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can find the number of chickens by substituting K back into the first equation:
   C + 15 = 20
   C = 20 - 15
   C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person
