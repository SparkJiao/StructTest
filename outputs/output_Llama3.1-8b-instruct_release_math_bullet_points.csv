Carla can download 2 GB/minute. To find out how long it takes to download the file, we need to divide the total size of the file by her download speed.

## 
**Step 2** Calculate the time to download the file normally
Time to download the file normally = Total size of the file / Download speed
Time to download the file normally = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time to download the file normally = 100 minutes

## 
**Step 3** Calculate the time to download 40% of the file
40% of the file is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 40% of the file = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time to download 40% of the file = 40 minutes

## 
**Step 4** Calculate the remaining time to download the file after the restart
Time to download the file normally = 100 minutes
Time to download 40% of the file = 40 minutes
Remaining time to download the file = Time to download the file normally - Time to download 40% of the file
Remaining time to download the file = 100 minutes - 40 minutes
Remaining time to download the file = 60 minutes

## 
**Step 5** Add the time taken for the restart
Time taken for the restart = 20 minutes
Total time to download the file = Remaining time to download the file + Time taken for the restart
Total time to download the file = 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time to download the file = 80 minutes

60% of the file is 0.6 * 200 GB = 120 GB
Time to download the remaining 60% of the file = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time to download the remaining 60% of the file = 60 minutes

## 
**Step 7** Add the time to download the remaining 60% of the file to the total time
Total time to download the file = Total time to download the file + Time to download the remaining 60% of the file
Total time to download the file = 80 minutes + 60 minutes

8,"**Step 1** Calculate the distance John drove on his way to the unknown location.
John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

## 

**Step 2** Calculate the time John spent driving on his way back home.
John tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. This means he has 4 - 2 = 2 hours left to drive.
However, he spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, and then drives the remaining time at 80 mph. We need to calculate the remaining time after the half-hour drive.
Remaining time = 2 hours - 0.5 hours
Remaining time = 1.5 hours

## 

**Step 3** Calculate the distance John drove in the first half-hour at 30 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

## 

**Step 4** Calculate the distance John drove at 80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance = 120 miles

## 

**Step 5** Calculate the total distance John drove on his way back home.
Total distance = Distance driven at 30 mph + Distance driven at 80 mph
Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles
Total distance = 135 miles

## 

**Step 6** Calculate the total distance John drove from home to the unknown location and back home.
Total distance = Distance driven to the unknown location + Distance driven back home
Total distance = 180 miles + 135 miles
Total distance = 315 miles

To find Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

### 2
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. We will use this rate to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours.

### 3
To find her earnings for the first 40 hours, we multiply her regular hourly rate by the number of hours she worked in the first 40 hours.

### 4
Earnings for the first 40 hours = Regular hourly rate * Number of hours in the first 40 hours
Earnings for the first 40 hours = $10 * 40
Earnings for the first 40 hours = $400

### 5
Eliza also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. We will use this rate to calculate her earnings for the overtime hours.

### 6
To find her earnings for the overtime hours, we multiply her overtime hourly rate by the number of overtime hours.

### 7
Number of overtime hours = Total hours worked - Number of hours in the first 40 hours
Number of overtime hours = 45 - 40
Number of overtime hours = 5

### 8
Overtime hourly rate = Regular hourly rate * Overtime pay multiplier
Overtime hourly rate = $10 * 1.2
Overtime hourly rate = $12

The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

### Step 2. Calculate the number of downloads in the second month
The number of downloads in the second month is three times as many as the downloads in the first month.
So, downloads in the second month = 3 * downloads in the first month
downloads in the second month = 3 * 60
downloads in the second month = 180

### Step 3. Calculate the number of downloads in the third month
The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% from the downloads in the second month.
So, downloads in the third month = downloads in the second month - (30% of downloads in the second month)
downloads in the third month = 180 - (0.3 * 180)
downloads in the third month = 180 - 54
downloads in the third month = 126

### Step 4. Calculate the total number of downloads over the three months
The total number of downloads is the sum of downloads in the first month, second month, and third month.
So, total downloads = downloads in the first month + downloads in the second month + downloads in the third month
total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126
total downloads = 366

To find the total cost of the pastries, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

### 2
First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Toula bought 3 dozen donuts, and each dozen costs $68. So, the total cost of the donuts is:

3 * $68 = $204

### 3
Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes, and each dozen costs $80. So, the total cost of the mini cupcakes is:

2 * $80 = $160

### 4
Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes. Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, and each dozen costs $55. So, the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is:

6 * $55 = $330

### 5
Now that we have the cost of each type of pastry, we can add them together to find the total cost.

### 6
Adding the cost of the donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes, we get:

$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

### 7
Therefore, the total cost of the pastries is $694.

### 8
We can also verify our answer by adding the cost of each dozen of pastries and then multiplying by the number of dozens.

### 9
The total cost of the pastries can also be calculated as:

(3 * $68) + (2 * $80) + (6 * $55) = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. He will sell each lemon for $1.5 and it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

Each year the tree will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. So, the total income from selling lemons each year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

### 2
The total cost for each year is the cost of watering and feeding the tree, which is $3.

### 3
To find out when Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the profit each year. The profit is the total income minus the total cost.

### 4
In the first year, the profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

### 5
In the second year, the profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

### 6
In the third year, the profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

### 7
We can see that the profit is $7.5 each year, which is greater than 0. This means that Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree in the first year.

### 8
However, we need to consider the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90. Since the profit in the first year is $7.5, it will take 13 years for the total profit to be greater than or equal to the initial cost.

### 9
In the 13th year, the total profit is $7.5 * 13 = $97.5, which is greater than the initial cost of $90.

### 10
Therefore, it will take Carlos 13 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.

Melanie had some vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house and the red house. Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners she started with ""x"".

**Step 2** Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house.
Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

**Step 3** Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.
The number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3.

**Step 4** Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house.
Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

**Step 5** Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house.
The number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house is 2x/3 - 2.

**Step 6** Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house.
Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

**Step 7** Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.
The number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house is 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1.

**Step 8** Set up an equation to solve for x.
We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation x/3 - 1 = 5.

**Step 9** Solve for x.
To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by adding 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6. Then, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get x = 18.

To determine which purchase plan will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both options.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%.

### 2
First, let's calculate the potential increase in value for the jewelry.

The initial value of the jewelry is $5,000. 
A 2.5% increase in value means the jewelry will be worth $5,000 + ($5,000 x 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

### 3
Next, let's calculate the potential increase in value for the electronic gadgets.

The initial value of the electronic gadgets is $8,000. 
A 1.2% increase in value means the electronic gadgets will be worth $8,000 + ($8,000 x 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

### 4
Now, let's compare the potential increase in value for both options.

The jewelry is expected to be worth $5,125, and the electronic gadgets are expected to be worth $8,096.

### 5
To determine which option will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the difference between the potential increase in value and the initial purchase price.

For the jewelry, the potential profit is $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

For the electronic gadgets, the potential profit is $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

### 6
Comparing the potential profits, we can see that the jewelry option has a higher potential profit of $125.

### 7
However, we need to consider the initial purchase price of each option.

The jewelry costs $5,000, and the electronic gadgets cost $8,000.

### 8
To determine which option will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit as a percentage of the initial purchase price.

For the jewelry, the profit is $125, which is 2.5% of the initial purchase price.

For the electronic gadgets, the profit is $96, which is 1.2% of the initial purchase price.

### 9
Comparing the profit as a percentage of the initial purchase price, we can see that the jewelry option has a higher profit percentage of 2.5%.

### 10
Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

We have two trains traveling in the same direction for the first part of their journey. Since they are traveling westward, we can consider this as a straight line.

They both travel for 80 miles in the first part of their journey. This means that each train covers a distance of 80 miles.


### 2
Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can consider the second part of their journey as another straight line. They travel northward, covering 150 miles.


### 3
To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered in the first and second parts of their journey.


### 4
The distance covered by each train in the first part of their journey is 80 miles.


### 5
The distance covered by each train in the second part of their journey is 150 miles.


### 6
To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the distances covered in the first and second parts of their journey.


### 7
Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles


### 8
Since both trains cover the same distance, the distance covered by each train is the same.


### 9
Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

17,"**Step 1** Calculate the total hours Jill works as a teacher per year
Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher and works for 50 weeks a year. To find the total hours she works as a teacher per year, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works.

Total hours as a teacher = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the total hours Jill works as a coach per year
Jill works 15 hours a week as a coach and works for 50 weeks a year. To find the total hours she works as a coach per year, we multiply the hours she works per week by the number of weeks she works.

Total hours as a coach = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher
Jill gets paid $20 per hour as a teacher. To find her annual salary as a teacher, we multiply her hourly wage by the total hours she works as a teacher per year.

Annual salary as a teacher = $20/hour * 1750 hours/year = $35,000/year

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculate Jill's annual salary as a coach
Jill gets paid $30 per hour as a coach. To find her annual salary as a coach, we multiply her hourly wage by the total hours she works as a coach per year.

Annual salary as a coach = $30/hour * 750 hours/year = $22,500/year

------------------------

**Step 5** Calculate Jill's total annual salary
To find Jill's total annual salary, we add her annual salary as a teacher and her annual salary as a coach.

Total annual salary = Annual salary as a teacher + Annual salary as a coach
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

------------------------

**Step 6** Since we are asked to find the total annual salary, we don't need to do any further calculations.

The final answer is:

There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 4 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

There are 28 days in 4 weeks.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of omelets Claire makes in 4 weeks
Claire makes 1 omelet per day, so she makes 28 omelets in 4 weeks.

Claire makes 28 omelets in 4 weeks.

**Step 3** Calculate the number of eggs in 28 omelets
Each omelet requires 3 eggs, so 28 omelets require 28 * 3 = 84 eggs.

There are 84 eggs in 28 omelets.

**Step 4** Calculate the number of dozens of eggs
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens.

We will divide 84 by 12.

**Step 5** Perform the division
84 / 12 = 7.

There are 7 dozens of eggs.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints12MathFormat'}

20,"**Step 1** Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.
The orange drink is two-thirds water, so we multiply 10 liters by 2/3 to get the amount of water in the orange drink.

The amount of water in the orange drink is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters.

**Step 2** Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.
The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so we multiply 15 liters by 3/5 to get the amount of water in the pineapple drink.

The amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters.

**Step 3** Calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink.
We add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to get the total amount of water.

The total amount of water is 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters.

**Step 4** Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink after spilling 1 liter.
We subtract 1 liter from the original amount of orange drink, which is 10 liters.

The amount of orange drink left is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

**Step 5** Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink.
We multiply the remaining amount of orange drink by 2/3 to get the amount of water in the remaining orange drink.

The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters.

**Step 6** Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink.
We add the amount of water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to get the total amount of water.

The total amount of water is 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

**Step 7** Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink.
We already know that the total amount of water is 15 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink is 15 liters.

To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we first need to determine how many cartons she will buy in 60 days.

She eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

### 2
Since each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream, we need to divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton to find out how many cartons she will buy.

Number of cartons = Total servings / Servings per carton
= 60 / 15
= 4

### 3
Now that we know Cynthia will buy 4 cartons of ice cream, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton.

Cost per carton = $4.00
Number of cartons = 4

### 4
Total cost = Cost per carton * Number of cartons
= $4.00 * 4
= $16.00

### 5
However, we need to consider that Cynthia will buy 4 cartons, but she will eat 60 servings, which is more than 4 cartons. This means she will have to buy an additional carton to cover the remaining servings.

### 6
To find out how many servings are left after buying 4 cartons, we subtract the total servings in 4 cartons from the total number of servings.

Servings in 4 cartons = 4 * 15
= 60
Servings left = Total servings - Servings in 4 cartons
= 60 - 60
= 0

### 7
However, since we know that she will eat 60 servings, and 4 cartons will only cover 60 servings, we can conclude that she will indeed need to buy 5 cartons to cover all 60 servings.

### 8
Now that we know Cynthia will buy 5 cartons of ice cream, we can recalculate the total cost by multiplying the new number of cartons by the cost per carton.

Cost per carton = $4.00
Number of cartons = 5

### 9
Total cost = Cost per carton * Number of cartons
= $4.00 * 5

Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

### Step 2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop
Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop.

### Step 3. Determine the distance traveled after the first stop but before the second stop
Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we need to find out how much distance is left after the first stop. The total distance is 60 miles, and he traveled 20 miles before the first stop. So, the distance left after the first stop is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

### Step 4. Determine the distance traveled before the second stop
Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we need to subtract 15 miles from the remaining distance after the first stop. So, the distance traveled before the second stop is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

### Step 5. Determine the distance traveled between the first and second stops
The distance traveled between the first and second stops is the distance traveled before the second stop, which is 25 miles.

John bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 x $20 = $160.

##


**Step 3** Calculate the amount of money John had left after buying the video games
John had $195 initially and spent $160 on video games, so he had $195 - $160 = $35 left.

##


**Step 4** Calculate the amount of money John had left after buying the video games and having $5 left
John had $35 left after buying the video games and he had $5 left, so the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $35 + $5 = $40.

##


**Step 5** Calculate the number of Lego sets John sold
John made $40 from selling the Lego sets, and each set was sold for $15, so the number of Lego sets he sold is $40 / $15 = 2.67.

Let's verify the result by calculating the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets and the amount of money he spent on video games. If the result is correct, then John should have $5 left after buying the video games. The total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets is 10 x $15 = $150. The amount of money he spent on video games is 8 x $20 = $160. The amount of money John had left after buying the video games is $150 - $160 = -$10.

Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw it 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

### 2. Calculate the distance from the dragon that Polly can safely stand
The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To safely stand outside of the reach of the flames, Polly needs to be at least 1001 feet away from the dragon.

### 3. Determine the maximum distance Polly can stand and still hit the dragon
Since Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone, she can stand at a distance of 1200 feet from the dragon and still hit it.

### 4. Calculate the distance outside of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand
To find the distance outside of the dragon's flames, subtract the distance of the dragon's flames from the maximum distance Polly can stand. distance_outside_flames = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

### 5. Verify the result
Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

### 6. Consider the initial condition
The initial condition states that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. This is not relevant to the calculation, but it's good to note that the gemstone increases her throwing distance.

### 7. Consider the dragon's flames
The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, which is the critical factor in determining the safe distance for Polly to stand.

### 8. Consider Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone
Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone is 1200 feet, which is the maximum distance she can stand and still hit the dragon.

### 9. Consider the distance outside of the dragon's flames
The distance outside of the dragon's flames is 200 feet, which is the result of subtracting the dragon's flames distance from Polly's maximum throwing distance.

### 10. Finalize the result
The final result is the distance outside of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

42,"**Step 1** Calculate the total number of pie pieces initially available
There were 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie.

Total pieces = 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

There were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening.

## 

**Step 2** Determine the number of pieces taken by the guests
To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially available.

Pieces taken = Total pieces - Remaining pieces
= 40 pieces - 14 pieces
= 26 pieces

## 

**Step 3** Verify the calculation
We have calculated that 26 pieces were taken by the guests. This is a reasonable number, considering that there were 5 pies with 8 pieces each, and only 14 pieces were left over.

## 

**Step 4** Consider alternative scenarios
We have assumed that all 5 pies were cut into 8 pieces and that no pieces were left uneaten. However, it's possible that some pieces were left uneaten or that some pies were not cut into 8 pieces. Our calculation assumes that all pieces were taken and eaten.

## 

**Step 5** Consider the implications of the calculation
If 26 pieces were taken by the guests, it means that each guest took an average of 2.6 pieces (26 pieces / number of guests). However, we don't know the exact number of guests, so we can't calculate the average number of pieces per guest.

## 

**Step 6** Consider the context of the problem
The problem states that Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. This suggests that the event was a relatively small gathering, and it's likely that the number of guests was not extremely large.

## 

**Step 7** Consider the possibility of fractional pieces
We have assumed that all pieces were whole, but it's possible that some pieces were cut into fractional pieces. However, this would not affect our calculation, as we are only concerned with the number of whole pieces taken by the guests.

43,"### 1. Calculate the total calories in the 300g bag of chips
The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. To find the total calories in the bag, we multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving.

Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

### 2. Determine the remaining daily calorie target
You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily calorie target is 2000. To find the remaining calories you can consume, we subtract the calories already consumed from the daily target.

Remaining daily calorie target = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

### 3. Calculate the grams of chips you can eat
Since the bag has 1250 calories in total, and you can only consume 200 calories, we need to find the fraction of the bag that represents 200 calories. We then multiply this fraction by the total weight of the bag (300g) to find the grams you can eat.

Fraction of the bag = 200 calories / 1250 calories = 0.16

Grams you can eat = 0.16 * 300g = 48g

### 4. Round the result to a reasonable number of decimal places
Since we're dealing with grams, we can round the result to 2 decimal places.

Grams you can eat ≈ 48.00g

### 5. Final result
The final result is the grams you can eat, rounded to 2 decimal places.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article.

### 2
First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday.
She wrote 5 articles on Monday.

### 3
Next, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.
She wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, which means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) articles on Tuesday.
To calculate 2/5 * 5, we multiply 2 by 5 and then divide by 5.
2 * 5 = 10
10 / 5 = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday.
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.

### 5
Now that we have the number of articles Meredith wrote each day, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days.
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

### 6
Since it takes an average of 4 hours to write one article, let's calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days.
Total hours = Total articles * Time per article
Total hours = 26 * 4
Total hours = 104

### 7
However, we need to consider that Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, which means she wrote 2 extra articles on Tuesday.
So, the total number of articles she wrote is 26 - 2 = 24.

### 8
Now, let's recalculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days.
Total hours = Total articles * Time per article
Total hours = 24 * 4
Total hours = 96

### 9
However, we need to consider that Meredith wrote 2 extra articles on Tuesday, but she also wrote 2 extra articles on Wednesday, which means she wrote 2 extra articles in total.
So, the total number of articles she wrote is 24 - 2 = 22.

### 10
Now, let's recalculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days.

To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot.

### 2
We multiply the length of the wire in feet by the number of inches in 1 foot to get the total length in inches. 
Total length in inches = 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

### 3
Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained. 
Number of pieces = Total length in inches / Length of each piece
= 48 inches / 6 inches

### 4
Perform the division to find the number of pieces. 
Number of pieces = 8

### 5
Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we round down to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the division results in a whole number.

### 6
Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

### 7
However, we need to consider if there is any remainder after cutting the wire into 8 pieces of 6 inches each. 
Length of 8 pieces = 8 * 6 inches = 48 inches

### 8
Since the total length of the wire is 48 inches, and we used 48 inches to cut 8 pieces of 6 inches each, there is no remainder.

### 9
This means that Tracy used the entire wire to cut 8 pieces of 6 inches each.

### 10
Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

#### 1. Determine the number of eggs produced per day
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

#### 2. Calculate the number of eggs sold per day
Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per day.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

#### 3. Calculate the daily revenue from egg sales
Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen. Multiply the number of dozens sold per day by the price per dozen to find the daily revenue.
21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

#### 4. Determine the number of days in a week
There are 7 days in a week.

#### 5. Calculate the weekly revenue from egg sales
Multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week to find the weekly revenue.
$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

To solve this problem, we need to first find the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

### 2
Since we don't know the exact distance, we can assume that the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours (3 hours = 1 hour + 2 hours).

### 3
We can use the formula: distance = speed * time to find the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

### 4
Given that Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, we can plug in the values to get: distance = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

### 5
Now that we know the distance, we can use the same formula to find the time taken to travel back at a rate of 6 mph.

### 6
We can plug in the values to get: time = distance / speed = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

### 7
However, we need to consider that Tom is traveling back, so the time taken will be the same as the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM.

### 8
Therefore, the time taken to get back is 5 hours.

### 9
But we need to consider that the question asks for the time taken to get back, not the total time taken for the round trip.

### 2
To find out how much weight is left to remove, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight to be removed: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

### 3
Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to reach a total weight of 7.5 pounds.

There are 3 types of oranges in the basket: 
- 1 bad orange
- 20% unripe oranges
- 2 sour oranges

The rest of the oranges are good.

### 2
First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe.

To find 20% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.2.

25 * 0.2 = 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

### 3
Now, let's find out how many oranges are bad and sour. We know that there is 1 bad orange and 2 sour oranges.

So, the total number of bad and sour oranges is 1 + 2 = 3.

### 4
Now, let's find out how many oranges are good. We know that there are 25 oranges in total, 5 unripe oranges, 3 bad and sour oranges.

So, the number of good oranges is 25 - (5 + 3).

### 5
Now, let's calculate the number of good oranges.

25 - (5 + 3) = 25 - 8 = 17

So, there are 17 good oranges.

### 6
Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17.

### 7
We can also represent this as a formula:

Total oranges = Good oranges + Unripe oranges + Bad oranges + Sour oranges

25 = Good oranges + 5 + 3 + 2

25 = Good oranges + 10

Good oranges = 25 - 10

Good oranges = 15

However, this is incorrect as we have already calculated the number of good oranges to be 17.

### 8
Let's verify our answer by checking if the total number of oranges is indeed 25.

Total oranges = Good oranges + Unripe oranges + Bad oranges + Sour oranges

25 = 17 + 5 + 1 + 2

25 = 25

#### 1. Determine the total capacity of Sophia's gas tank
The owner's manual for Sophia's car states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

#### 2. Determine the amount of gas used to fill the tank
Sophia needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank up again.

#### 3. Determine the amount of gas left in the tank after filling
Since the tank holds 12 gallons and 4 gallons were added, there are 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left in the tank.

#### 4. Determine the amount of gas used per mile
Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she used 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. To find the amount of gas used per mile, we divide the amount of gas used by the distance traveled: 4 gallons / 100 miles = 0.04 gallons per mile.

#### 5. Determine the total amount of gas in the tank
The total amount of gas in the tank is the sum of the gas left in the tank and the gas used to fill it up: 8 gallons + 4 gallons = 12 gallons.

#### 6. Calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas
To find the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we multiply the total amount of gas in the tank by the amount of gas used per mile: 12 gallons * 100 miles / 4 gallons = 300 miles.

#### 7. Verify the calculation
We can verify the calculation by checking if the amount of gas used to fill the tank is equal to the amount of gas used per mile multiplied by the distance traveled: 4 gallons = 0.04 gallons/mile * 100 miles. This is true, so our calculation is correct.

#### 8. Consider the remaining gas in the tank
Since Sophia has already used 4 gallons of gas, we need to subtract this from the total amount of gas in the tank to find the remaining gas: 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons. However, this remaining gas is already accounted for in the calculation.

#### 9. Consider the tank's capacity
The tank's capacity is 12 gallons, and we have already used 4 gallons. However, this is not relevant to the calculation, as we are interested in the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

#### 10. Final calculation
The final calculation is 12 gallons * 100 miles / 4 gallons = 300 miles.

Each school has sent two teams: a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.

#### 3. Calculate the number of players in each team
Each team has 5 players.

#### 4. Calculate the total number of players sent by each school
Since each school has two teams, the total number of players sent by each school is 2 * 5 = 10 players.

#### 5. Calculate the total number of coaches sent by each school
Each school has sent a coach for each team, so the total number of coaches sent by each school is 2 coaches.

#### 6. Calculate the total number of people sent by each school
The total number of people sent by each school is the sum of the total number of players and the total number of coaches, which is 10 + 2 = 12 people.

#### 7. Calculate the total number of people sent by all schools
Since there are four schools, the total number of people sent by all schools is 4 * 12 = 48 people.

### 2
First, let's calculate how many packages of 3 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers. We can do this by dividing 18 by 3.

18 / 3 = 6

### 3
Since Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers, we can multiply the number of packages by the cost per package to find the total cost.

6 * $2.50 = $15

### 4
Next, let's calculate how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers. We can do this by dividing 18 by 2.

18 / 2 = 9

### 5
Since Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers, we can multiply the number of packages by the cost per package to find the total cost.

9 * $1 = $9

### 6
Now that we have the total cost for both options, we can compare them to find out which one is cheaper.

### 7
Since $9 is less than $15, buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is the better option.

To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her initial salary after five years of service.

### 2
The company pays each employee $600 in a month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Sylvie's initial annual salary is $600 * 12 = $7200.

### 3
Sylvie's salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. 

### 4
To calculate the increase in salary, we need to find 10% of $7200. This is calculated as $7200 * 0.10 = $720.

### 5
After the first year, Sylvie's salary will be $7200 + $720 = $7920.

### 6
In the second year, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of $7920, which is $792 * 0.10 = $792. Her new salary will be $7920 + $792 = $8712.

### 7
In the third year, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of $8712, which is $871.2 * 0.10 = $87.12. Her new salary will be $8712 + $87.12 = $8799.12.

### 8
In the fourth year, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of $8799.12, which is $879.91 * 0.10 = $87.99. Her new salary will be $8799.12 + $87.99 = $8887.11.

### 9
In the fifth year, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of $8887.11, which is $888.71 * 0.10 = $88.87. Her new salary will be $8887.11 + $88.87 = $8975.98.

### 10
Since Sylvie has already completed five years of service, her salary will not increase for the next three years. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service will be $8975.98.

Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so if we let Gerald's time be x, then Lee's time is x - 2.

**Step 2** Calculate Gerald's original time
Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can set up the equation x - 2 = 38 to find Gerald's original time.

**Step 3** Solve for Gerald's original time
Solving the equation x - 2 = 38, we get x = 40.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

There are 60 dogs, so the number of cats is 60 * 2 = 120.

### 

### Step 2. Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats
To find the combined number of dogs and cats, we add the number of dogs to the number of cats.

The number of dogs is 60, and the number of cats is 120, so the combined number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

### 

### Step 3. Find the number of rabbits
The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. We can calculate the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

The combined number of dogs and cats is 180, so the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

### 

### Step 4. Calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood
To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

The number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 120, and the number of rabbits is 168, so the total number of pets is 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes she used to make 32 ounces of sauce.

### 2
Since each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce, each 16 ounce can will result in 8 ounces of sauce.

### 3
To find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the total amount of sauce (32 ounces) by the amount of sauce each can produces (8 ounces).

1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

### 4
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We already know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The city is 42 miles across, and we need to divide it by the 3-mile sections that the fog bank covers every 10 minutes.

### 2
We can calculate the number of 3-mile sections by dividing the total distance of the city (42 miles) by the distance covered by the fog bank in each section (3 miles).

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since the fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 14 sections.

We can calculate this by dividing the total number of sections (14) by the number of sections covered in 10 minutes (1 section).

14 sections / 1 section per 10 minutes = 14 intervals

### 4
Since each interval is 10 minutes, we can multiply the number of intervals (14) by the time taken for each interval (10 minutes) to find the total time taken for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

14 intervals * 10 minutes per interval = 140 minutes

However, we need to consider that the first 13 sections will be covered in 13 intervals of 10 minutes each, and the 14th section will be covered in the same 10-minute interval as the 13th section.

So, the total time taken for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 13 intervals * 10 minutes per interval + 10 minutes for the 14th section.

13 intervals * 10 minutes per interval = 130 minutes
130 minutes + 10 minutes = 140 minutes

However, we need to consider that the first 13 sections will be covered in 13 intervals of 10 minutes each, and the 14th section will be covered in the same 10-minute interval as the 13th section.

So, the total time taken for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 13 intervals * 10 minutes per interval + 10 minutes for the 14th section.

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we can multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3 to find out how many cookies Cody eats.

### 4
So, if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats 5 x 3 = 15 cookies.

To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas without the rewards.

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons of gas. 

The total cost of the gas without the rewards is: 
10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00


### 2
The app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon. To find out the total cashback rewards, we need to multiply the cashback amount per gallon by the number of gallons purchased.

The total cashback rewards are: 
$.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00


### 3
Now, we need to subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas to find out the final cost of the gas after the rewards.

The final cost of the gas after the rewards is: 
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00


### 4
To confirm our answer, we can also calculate the final cost of the gas after the rewards by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased and then subtracting the total cashback rewards.

The final cost of the gas after the rewards is: 
(10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon) - (10 gallons * $.20 per gallon) = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00


### 5
We can also simplify the calculation by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased and then subtracting the total cashback rewards.

The final cost of the gas after the rewards is: 
$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons - $.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00


### 6
We can also simplify the calculation by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased and then subtracting the total cashback rewards.

The final cost of the gas after the rewards is: 
$3.00 * 10 - $.20 * 10 = $30 - $2 = $28


### 7
We can also simplify the calculation by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased and then subtracting the total cashback rewards.

The final cost of the gas after the rewards is: 
$30 - $2 = $28


### 8
We can also simplify the calculation by multiplying the cost per gallon by the number of gallons purchased and then subtracting the total cashback rewards.

The final cost of the gas after the rewards is:

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

### 2
Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is the product of these two numbers.

### 3
We multiply 2 (width) and 24 (length) to get the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate: 2 * 24 = 48

### 4
Marcell's roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is the product of these two numbers.

### 5
We multiply 3 (width) and 14 (length) to get the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate: 3 * 14 = 42

### 6
Now that we know the total number of roll-ups each of them ate, we can find the total number of roll-ups they ate together by adding these two numbers.

### 7
We add 48 (Beatrice's roll-ups) and 42 (Marcell's roll-ups) to get the total number of roll-ups they ate together: 48 + 42 = 90

### 8
To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups they ate together by 2 (since there are two people).

### 9
We divide 90 (total roll-ups) by 2 to get the average number of roll-ups they ate: 90 / 2 = 45

### 10
Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45.

### 4. Calculate the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband gave her the new spoons.
The total number of spoons Julia had after her husband gave her the new spoons is x + 5.

### 5. Calculate the total number of spoons Julia had after using some to sample her stew.
The total number of spoons Julia had after using some to sample her stew is (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

### 6. Identify the total number of spoons Julia had when she set the table.
Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table.

### 7. Set up an equation to solve for the initial number of spoons Julia had.
Since the total number of spoons Julia had when she set the table is 12, we can set up the equation x + 2 = 12.

### 8. Solve for the initial number of spoons Julia had.
To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 10.

### 9. Determine the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.
Since x represents the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

### 10. Verify the solution.
We can verify the solution by checking if the total number of spoons Julia had when she set the table is indeed 12. If we add the 5 spoons her husband gave her, the 3 spoons she used to sample her stew, and the 10 spoons in the package she bought, we get 10 + 5 - 3 = 12, which is correct.

### 4
### 
Now, we can calculate the total time spent by doctors. Total time = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.

### 5
### 
The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital. So, the total cost to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

### 6
### 
Next, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients. We know that the hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.

### 7
### 
Since each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, the total amount charged to each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.

### 8
### 
Now, we can calculate the total amount charged to all patients. Total amount charged = 500 patients * $80/patient = $40,000.

### 9
### 
Finally, we can calculate the hospital's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total amount charged. Profit = Total amount charged - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

### 10
### 
Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday.

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

### 2
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. 
So, we multiply the miles he walked on Monday by 6 to find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday.

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles

### 3
We know that Walt's total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. 
We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday.

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.
We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

### 2. We can express the total number of bees in terms of B.

Since there are 700 bees in total, we can write the equation: W + B + Q = 700.
Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation, we get: 2B + B + Q = 700.
Combining like terms, we get: 3B + Q = 700.

### 3. We can express Q in terms of B.

From the equation B = 2Q, we can express Q as: Q = B/2.

### 4. Substitute Q = B/2 into the equation 3B + Q = 700.

We get: 3B + B/2 = 700.
To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2, resulting in: 6B + B = 1400.
Combining like terms, we get: 7B = 1400.

### 5. Solve for B.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get: B = 200.

### 6. Find the number of worker bees W.

Since W = 2B, we can substitute B = 200 into the equation, resulting in: W = 2(200).
W = 400.

### 7. We have found the number of worker bees.

The number of worker bees is 400.

### 8. We can verify our answer by checking if the total number of bees is indeed 700.

W + B + Q = 400 + 200 + 100 = 700.

### 2
Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, we need to find out how many hours he would work in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

### 3
We can calculate the total hours worked in a week by multiplying the hours worked per day by the number of days in a week.

- Light bulbs cost 3 dollars.
- Cups cost 3 dollars.
- Roach traps cost 4 dollars.
- Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

### 3
Since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of non-food items including tax.

- Total cost of non-food items including tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

### 5
Next, let's calculate the cost of food items.

- Milk costs 2 dollars.
- Eggs cost 3 dollars.
- Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

### 6
Now, let's calculate the total cost of all items by adding the cost of food items and non-food items including tax.

In the next 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
We need to find the number of bees that left before but hadn't returned yet.

### 5
Now, we need to find the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours.
We know that 15 bees hadn't returned yet, so they will return to the hive.

152,"### 1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys
Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies inside. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack.

Each pack has 6 cookies
Carl buys 10 packs
Total cookies = 6 * 10 = 60 cookies

##


### 2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies
Each cookie costs $0.10. To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie.

Cost per cookie = $0.10
Total cookies = 60
Total cost = 0.10 * 60 = $6

### 3. Calculate the change Carl receives
Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid.

Amount Carl paid = $10
Total cost = $6
Change = 10 - 6 = $4

Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as x.

### 2
Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull stole the pack.


### 3
The seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.


### 4
After the seagull ate, there were x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 french fries left.


### 5
Three pigeons bullied the seagull away and each pigeon ate 3 fries, so the total number of fries eaten by pigeons is 3 * 3 = 9.


### 6
After the pigeons ate, there were (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30 french fries left.


### 7
A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).


### 8
The number of fries left after the raccoon stole is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30) = (1/3) * (x - 30).


### 9
Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind, so we can set up the equation (1/3) * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.


### 10
Now we can solve for x: (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6 => x - 30 = 18 => x = 48.

156,"**Step 1** Calculate the monthly banana requirement for all the apes.
The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month. So, the total monthly requirement is 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

 

**Step 2** Calculate the total banana requirement for 2 months.
Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the monthly requirement by 2. So, the total requirement is 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

 

**Step 3** Consider the fact that the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months.
Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we don't need to add any extra bananas for the first month. The order will cover the bananas needed for the second month as well.

 

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order.
Based on the previous steps, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

 

**Step 5** Verify the calculation.
We have calculated the total monthly requirement and multiplied it by 2 to get the total requirement for 2 months. This is a straightforward calculation and doesn't require any further verification.

 

**Step 6** Consider any additional factors that might affect the calculation.
There are no additional factors that might affect the calculation. The zookeeper's order will cover the bananas needed for the apes for 2 months.

 

**Step 7** Review the calculation to ensure accuracy.
We have reviewed the calculation and verified that it is accurate.

An action figure costs $5.

**Step 2** Calculate the cost of the doll
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

**Step 3** Calculate the cost of one red car
One red car costs $4.

**Step 4** Calculate the cost of 5 red cars
The cost of 5 red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

**Step 5** Calculate the cost of 3 action figures
The cost of 3 action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

**Step 6** Calculate the total cost of all toys

To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories.

She has a budget of €1500 and the total cost of the accessories will be the sum of the individual costs.

### 2
The cost of the computer machine is €1090, which includes a screen, keyboard, and mouse.

### 3
The cost of the scanner is €157.

### 4
The cost of the CD burner is €74.

### 5
The cost of the printer is €102.

### 6
To find the total cost, we need to add the individual costs together: €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102.

### 7
Performing the addition: €1090 + €157 = €1247, then €1247 + €74 = €1321, and finally €1321 + €102 = €1423.

### 8
The total cost of the computer accessories is €1423.

To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we first need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so we multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan.

### 2
We calculate the total number of eggs needed by multiplying 15 (number of flans) by 3 (number of eggs per flan).

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

### 3
Since Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get at least 45 eggs.

### 4
To do this, we divide the total number of eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits (9).

### 5
We perform the division: 45 ÷ 9 = 5

### 6
This means Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to get at least 45 eggs.

### 7
Since she needs 45 eggs and gets 9 eggs each time, babysitting 5 times will give her exactly 45 eggs.

### 8
Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

### 9
This is the minimum number of times she needs to babysit to get the required number of eggs.

* Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
* Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
* Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.

### 2
Since Sally Four is 8 years old, we can find Granny Red's age by multiplying Sally Four's age by 2.

* Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age = 2 * 8 = 16 years

### 2
To calculate 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, we need to find 50% of the minimum payment and add it to the minimum payment.

### 3
For the student loans, 50% of $300 is $150. Adding this to the minimum payment of $300 gives us a total of $450 per month.

### 4
For the credit card, 50% of $200 is $100. Adding this to the minimum payment of $200 gives us a total of $300 per month.

### 5
For the mortgage, 50% of $500 is $250. Adding this to the minimum payment of $500 gives us a total of $750 per month.

### 6
Now, we need to calculate the total amount Jessica pays per month by adding the increased payments for each debt.

### 7
The total amount Jessica pays per month is $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500 per month.

It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time it takes to peel one potato by 60.

The time it takes to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes. Multiply this by 60 to get the total time spent peeling the potatoes.

### 2. Convert the time to seconds for easier calculation
Since it's easier to work with seconds, we'll convert 1.5 minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes is equal to 1.5 x 60 = 90 seconds.

### 3. Calculate the total time spent peeling the potatoes in seconds
Multiply the time it takes to peel one potato (90 seconds) by the total number of potatoes (60) to get the total time spent peeling the potatoes.

90 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

### 4. Calculate the total time spent cutting the potatoes
It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut up a potato. Multiply this by the total number of potatoes (60) to get the total time spent cutting the potatoes.

5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

### 5. Add the total time spent peeling and cutting the potatoes
Add the total time spent peeling the potatoes (5400 seconds) to the total time spent cutting the potatoes (300 seconds) to get the total time spent prepping the potatoes.

5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds

### 6. Convert the total time from seconds to minutes
Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the total time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60.

5700 seconds / 60 = 95 minutes

### 7. Round the total time to the nearest minute
Since we're dealing with a large number of potatoes, it's reasonable to round the total time to the nearest minute.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade.

### 2
The cost of making one gallon of lemonade includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2.

### 3
So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.

### 4
They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is 20 glasses * $0.50 = $10.

### 5
The profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit from selling one gallon of lemonade is $10 - $5 = $5.

### 6
Since they made $25 in profit, we need to find out how many gallons of lemonade they made to get this profit.

### 7
To find out how many gallons of lemonade they made, we divide the total profit by the profit from selling one gallon of lemonade. So, the number of gallons made is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

### 8
Now that we know they made 5 gallons of lemonade, we can find out the total cost of lemons by multiplying the cost of lemons per gallon by the number of gallons made.

### 9
The total cost of lemons is $3 (cost of lemons per gallon) * 5 gallons = $15.

We are given that Bo has 40 crabs.

We will start by calculating the number of crabs Monic has, since we know she has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.

#### 

### 2
To find the number of crabs Monic has, we subtract 4 from the number of crabs Bo has.

Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

#### 

### 3
Now that we know Monic has 36 crabs, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has, since we know she has 10 more crabs than Monic.

Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

#### 

### 4
Now that we know the number of crabs each person has, we can calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.

Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46

#### 

### 5
Now we can add the numbers together to find the total number of crabs.

Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

#### 

### 6
We can also calculate the total number of crabs by adding the differences between the number of crabs each person has.

Total crabs = (Bo's crabs - 4) + (Bo's crabs - 4 + 10)
Total crabs = (40 - 4) + (40 - 4 + 10)
Total crabs = 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

#### 

### 7
We can also calculate the total number of crabs by adding the number of crabs Bo has, and then adding the differences between the number of crabs Monic and Rani have.

Total crabs = Bo's crabs + (Monic's crabs - Bo's crabs) + (Rani's crabs - Monic's crabs)
Total crabs = 40 + (36 - 40) + (46 - 36)
Total crabs = 40 - 4 + 10

The problem states that there are two candidates running for class representative, and the winner got 3/4 of the votes. We need to find the number of votes the loser got.

### Step 2. Identify the total number of votes
The total number of students who voted in the class is given as 80.

### Step 3. Calculate the number of votes the winner got
Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying the total number of votes by 3/4.

### Step 4. Perform the calculation
Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80 = 60

### Step 5. Calculate the number of votes the loser got
Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60 votes, we can calculate the number of votes the loser got by subtracting the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

### Step 6. Perform the calculation
Number of votes the loser got = 80 - 60 = 20

### Step 7. Verify the result
We can verify the result by checking if the number of votes the winner got and the number of votes the loser got add up to the total number of votes.

### Step 8. Verify the calculation
60 (votes the winner got) + 20 (votes the loser got) = 80 (total number of votes)

To solve this problem, we need to first identify the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and there were 200 pink calla lilies.

### 2
Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation: 5x = 200.

### 3
To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 5x = 200. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5.

### 4
Dividing both sides of the equation 5x = 200 by 5 gives us x = 40. This means that Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

### 5
We are also told that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Since she ordered 40 white carnations, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying 40 by 4.

### 6
Multiplying 40 by 4 gives us 160. This means that Sandra ordered 160 red roses.

### 7
Since Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

### 8
However, we need to consider if there are any missing red roses. The problem statement does not specify the number of missing red roses, so we will assume that Fred needs to deliver the total number of red roses ordered.

### 9
Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

We are given that Jean is two years older than Mark, and two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. We also know that Jan is 30 years old.

We need to find Jean's current age.


**Step 2** Finding Mark's age two years ago

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. We need to find out how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die (4, 5, and 6). The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

### 

### Step 2. Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6). The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 or 1/2. Since the die is rolled twice, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

### 

### Step 3. Calculate the difference in probability
To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

### 

### Step 4. Convert the difference in probability to a percentage
To convert the difference in probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

### 

### Step 5. Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3
Since the difference in probability is 25%, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The trader buys bags of wheat from a farmer at $20 per bag, transports them at $2 per bag, and sells them at $30 per bag with a total profit of $400. We need to find out how many bags the trader sold.

### Step 1. Calculate the profit per bag
The profit per bag can be calculated by subtracting the cost of buying and transporting the bag from the selling price. 

The cost of buying and transporting one bag is $20 (buying) + $2 (transporting) = $22.
The profit per bag is $30 (selling) - $22 (cost) = $8.

### Step 2. Calculate the total number of bags sold
To find the total number of bags sold, we need to divide the total profit by the profit per bag.

Total profit = $400
Profit per bag = $8

### Step 3. Divide the total profit by the profit per bag
Total number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Total number of bags sold = $400 / $8

Since Violetta needs one crayon per color, she needs 5 crayons. The total cost of the crayons will be the number of crayons multiplied by the cost of one crayon.

### 5. Calculate the total cost of the crayons
5 * 2 = 10 dollars

### 6. Determine the change Violetta will get
To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

### 7. Calculate the change Violetta will get
20 - 10 = 10 dollars

### 8. Consider the possibility of Violetta buying more than one crayon per color
If Violetta needs more than one crayon per color, she will need to buy more than 5 crayons. However, this will not change the fact that she has $20 and each crayon costs $2.

### 9. Consider the possibility of Violetta buying less than one crayon per color
If Violetta needs less than one crayon per color, she will need to buy fewer than 5 crayons. However, this will not change the fact that she has $20 and each crayon costs $2.

### 10. Determine the final result
The final result is that Violetta will get $10 as change.

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total amount of carrots to be distributed is:

2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

There are 200 pounds of carrots in total, and 80 pounds will be distributed to the restaurants. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to subtract the amount distributed from the total amount.

### 2
Now, let's calculate the amount of carrots that will not be used.

Total amount of carrots = 200 pounds
Amount distributed = 80 pounds

Unused carrots = Total amount of carrots - Amount distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

### 3
So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

### 4
This makes sense, because if each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots distributed will be 80 pounds. This leaves 120 pounds of carrots unused.

### 5
We can also verify this by dividing the total amount of carrots by the amount each restaurant receives.

Total amount of carrots = 200 pounds
Amount each restaurant receives = 2 pounds

Number of restaurants = 200 pounds / 2 pounds/restaurant
= 100 restaurants

However, we know that there are only 40 restaurants. This means that the calculation in step 5 is incorrect, and we should stick with the original calculation in step 1.

### 6
Another way to think about this problem is to consider the ratio of the total amount of carrots to the amount each restaurant receives.

Total amount of carrots = 200 pounds
Amount each restaurant receives = 2 pounds

The ratio is 200:2 or 100:1. This means that for every 1 pound of carrots that a restaurant receives, 100 pounds of carrots are left unused.

### 7
However, this ratio is not relevant to the problem, because we are trying to find the amount of carrots that will not be used, not the ratio of used to unused carrots.

### 8
We can also consider the fact that the problem states that each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. This means that the amount of carrots distributed will be a multiple of 2.

### 9
However, the total amount of carrots is 200 pounds, which is not a multiple of 2. This means that the amount of carrots distributed will be less than the total amount of carrots.

### 10
Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is the difference between the total amount of carrots and the amount distributed.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

### 2
After a month, she collected three times that number. 
So, she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards in the first month.

### 3
In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. 
So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month.

### 4
In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. 
The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100.
So, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards in the third month.

### 5
Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine collected in the three months.
She collected 60 cards in the first month, 40 cards in the second month, and 200 cards in the third month.
So, the total number of cards collected in the three months is 60 + 40 + 200 = 300.

### 6
Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
So, the total number of cards she has now is 20 (initial cards) + 300 (cards collected in the three months) = 320.

### 7
Therefore, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards now.

### 8
To find the final answer, we just need to add the initial cards and the cards collected in the three months.

### 9
We have already calculated the total number of cards collected in the three months, which is 300.
Now, we just need to add the initial cards to get the final answer.

The final answer is the sum of the initial cards and the cards collected in the three months.

To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day.

Each morning, Baldur gets 5 pails of water.
Each afternoon, Baldur gets 6 pails of water.

### 2
We need to add the number of pails he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total number of pails.

Total pails = pails in the morning + pails in the afternoon
Total pails = 5 + 6
Total pails = 11

### 3
Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we need to multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters in each pail to find the total number of liters.

Total liters = total pails * liters in each pail
Total liters = 11 * 5
Total liters = 55

### 4
Now we have the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day.

### 5
We can verify our calculation by breaking it down further.

Morning liters = pails in the morning * liters in each pail
Morning liters = 5 * 5
Morning liters = 25

Afternoon liters = pails in the afternoon * liters in each pail
Afternoon liters = 6 * 5
Afternoon liters = 30

Total liters = morning liters + afternoon liters
Total liters = 25 + 30
Total liters = 55

### 6
Our calculation is correct.

### 7
We can also use a formula to calculate the total number of liters.

Total liters = (pails in the morning + pails in the afternoon) * liters in each pail
Total liters = (5 + 6) * 5
Total liters = 11 * 5
Total liters = 55

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

### 2
We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

### 3
We are also given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This can be expressed as:

W = R + 2

### 4
Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for R.

### 5
Substituting W = R + 2 into the first equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

### 6
Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

### 7
Combining like terms, we get:

8R + 10 = 42

### 8
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

212,"**Step 1** Calculate the perimeter of the park
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width). In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles.

The perimeter of the park is 2 * (6 + 1.5) = 2 * 7.5 = 15 miles.

## 

**Step 2** Calculate the time spent walking
To calculate the time spent walking, we need to divide the distance walked (perimeter of the park) by the speed at which Gary walks. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour.

Time spent walking = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

## 

**Step 3** Verify the result
We have calculated the time spent walking by dividing the perimeter of the park by Gary's walking speed. This is a reasonable approach, as the perimeter represents the total distance walked and the speed represents the rate at which Gary walks.

The result is 5 hours, which is a reasonable value given the distance and speed.

## 

**Step 4** Consider alternative approaches
There are alternative approaches to solving this problem, such as calculating the time spent walking along each side of the park and then adding these times together. However, this approach is more complicated and may lead to errors.

Our approach of calculating the perimeter and dividing by the speed is simpler and more accurate.

## 

**Step 5** Consider the context of the problem
The problem states that Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which implies that he walks along the perimeter of the park. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the perimeter as the distance walked.

Our result of 5 hours is consistent with this context.

## 

**Step 6** Consider the units of measurement
The problem states that the park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles, which implies that the units of measurement are miles. Therefore, our result of 5 hours is consistent with the units of measurement.

## 

**Step 7** Consider the reasonableness of the result
The result of 5 hours is reasonable given the distance and speed. It is a plausible value for the time spent walking around the park.

## 

**Step 8** Consider the accuracy of the result
Our result is accurate to the nearest hour, which is sufficient for this problem.

## 

**Step 9** Consider the implications of the result
The result implies that Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. This is a significant amount of time, and it may be worth considering the implications of this for Gary's daily routine.

## 

**Step 10** Finalize the result
Based on our calculations and considerations, we conclude that Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and lost 16 gallons, so it now has 2x - 16 gallons.

The small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 16 gallons, so it now has x - 16 gallons.

------------------------

**Step 3** We are given that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

This can be expressed as an equation: 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16).

------------------------

**Step 4** Now, let's solve the equation 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16).

First, distribute the 4 on the right-hand side: 2x - 16 = 4x - 64.

Next, add 16 to both sides: 2x = 4x - 48.

Then, subtract 4x from both sides: -2x = -48.

Finally, divide both sides by -2: x = 24.

------------------------

**Step 5** Since x represents the initial amount of water in the small pool, we need to find the current amount of water in the small pool.

We know that the small pool initially had x = 24 gallons and lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. This includes the cost of the shoes and the belt.

She needs to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00.

### 2
The total amount she needs to earn is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

Total amount = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total amount = $320.00 + $32.00
Total amount = $352.00

### 3
Now that we know the total amount she needs to earn, we can calculate the number of hours she needs to work to earn this amount.

Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour.

### 4
To find the number of hours she needs to work, we can divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage.

Number of hours = Total amount / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours = 44

### 5
Since we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we can round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, in this case, the result is a whole number.

### 6
Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

### 7
We can verify our result by multiplying the number of hours by the hourly wage to ensure we get the total amount she needs to earn.

Total amount = Number of hours * Hourly wage
Total amount = 44 * $8.00
Total amount = $352.00

### 8
This confirms that our result is correct.

### 9
We can also check if the cost of the shoes and the belt is included in the total amount.

Cost of shoes + Cost of belt = $320.00 + $32.00
Cost of shoes + Cost of belt = $352.00

### 10

216,"### 1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back
Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 
The additional amount she needs to pay is 10% of $2000, which is 0.1 x $2000 = $200.
So, the total amount she needs to pay back is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

##


### 2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months
Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. 
The total amount she will pay in 12 months is $165 x 12 = $1980.

##


### 3. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months
The remaining balance is the total amount she needs to pay back minus the total amount she will pay in 12 months.
So, the remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

##


### 4. Check if Janeth will have any remaining balance after 12 months
Since Janeth will pay $1980 in 12 months, which is less than the total amount she needs to pay back ($2200), she will still have a remaining balance after 12 months.

##


### 5. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months
The remaining balance is the difference between the total amount she needs to pay back and the total amount she will pay in 12 months.
So, the remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

##


### 6. Consider the remaining balance as the final result
Since Janeth will still have a remaining balance after 12 months, the final result is the remaining balance.

To find out how many liters of water are in the tank now, we need to follow the steps below.

First, let's calculate how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters of water.


### 2

We know that the initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. Celine used 90 liters of water, so we subtract 90 from 120 to find out how much water is left.

120 - 90 = 30 liters


### 3

Now, let's calculate how much rainwater Celine collected. We are told that the rainwater collected is twice as much as what was left in the tank.

So, the amount of rainwater collected is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.


### 4

Now, let's add the remaining water in the tank to the collected rainwater to find out the total amount of water in the tank now.

To find the total number of flowers Andy planted, we need to calculate the number of petunias first.

The number of petunias is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. Since Andy planted 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

### 2
We subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to find the number of petunias.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

### 3
Now that we know the number of petunias, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

### 4
To add the number of geraniums and petunias, we simply add the two numbers together.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50

### 5
Now we perform the addition to find the total number of flowers.

### 6
90 + 50 = 140

### 7
Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy planted is 140.

### 8
We can also verify our answer by using a simple equation.

Let's say the number of petunias is x. Then, the number of geraniums is x + 40.

### 9
The total number of flowers is the sum of the number of geraniums and petunias, which is (x + 40) + x.

### 10
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 40.

### 11
Since we know that the total number of flowers is 140, we can set up the equation 2x + 40 = 140.

### 12
Solving for x, we get x = 50, which is the number of petunias.

### 13
Now that we know the number of petunias, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

### 14
Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50

### 15
Now we perform the addition to find the total number of flowers.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

### 2
First, let's calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months. 
30% of 120 watermelons is 0.3 x 120 = 36 watermelons.

### 3
So, Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home, leaving 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons on the farm.

### 4
After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is (3/4) x 84 = 63 watermelons.

### 5
So, Ashlyn harvested 63 watermelons, leaving 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons on the farm.

### 6
Now, let's calculate the total number of watermelons that were harvested. 
36 watermelons were taken home after two months, and 63 watermelons were harvested after two weeks. 
So, the total number of watermelons harvested is 36 + 63 = 99 watermelons.

### 7
Since the farm initially had 120 watermelons, and 99 watermelons were harvested, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 120 - 99 = 21 watermelons.

### 8
However, we already calculated in step 5 that there were 21 watermelons left on the farm after two weeks. 
This means that the 21 watermelons left on the farm are the ones that were not ready to be harvested.

### 9
Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.

### 10
We can conclude that the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is indeed 21.

To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of slices required for 20 friends, with each friend getting 4 slices.

### 2
The total number of slices required can be calculated by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend will get.

### 3
So, the total number of slices required is 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

### 4
Since pizzas are sold in 8-slice portions, we need to find out how many 8-slice portions are required to meet the total number of slices needed.

### 5
To do this, we divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza, which is 8.

### 6
So, the number of pizzas required is 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

### 7
However, since we can't order a fraction of a pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary.

### 8
In this case, we don't need to round up because 10 pizzas will provide exactly 80 slices, which meets the requirement.

### 9
Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

### 10
This will provide enough slices for everyone to enjoy.

30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who went out through exit A, we need to calculate 30% of 1000.

The number of students who went out through exit A is 0.3 x 1000 = 300.

### 

### Step 2. Calculate the number of remaining students after exit A
After 300 students went out through exit A, the number of remaining students is 1000 - 300 = 700.

### 

### Step 3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B
3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who went out through exit B, we need to calculate 3/5 of 700.

The number of students who went out through exit B is (3/5) x 700 = 420.

### 

### Step 4. Calculate the number of remaining students after exit B
After 420 students went out through exit B, the number of remaining students is 700 - 420 = 280.

### 

### Step 5. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C
The rest of the students went out through exit C. Since there are 280 students remaining, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up an equation to find out how many candies Robert has.

### 2
Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R. We can write the equation as:

2R = 54

### 3
To find out the value of R, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.

R = 54 / 2

### 4
Now, we can calculate the value of R.

R = 27

### 5
Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to the number of candies Robert has.

James has R + 6 candies.

### 6
Now, we can calculate the number of candies James has.

James has 27 + 6 candies.

### 7
Now, we can calculate the number of candies James has.

James has 33 candies.

### 8
To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

### 9
Now, we can calculate the difference.

Difference = 54 - 33

### 10
Now, we can calculate the difference.

To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total number of girls in the school. We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls.

### 2
Since there are 3 classes in total, and each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

### 3
We also know that the school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

### 4
However, we already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

### 5
Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, and the total number of girls in the first two classes is 27, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3.

### 6
We know that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. This means that the total number of boys in the school is also 30.

### 7
Since the third class has 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class can be found by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in the class. So, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. We know that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

### 2
To calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times, we multiply 30 by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%).

30 * 0.3 = 9

### 3
Now, we subtract the result from step 2 from Mitchel's 30 times to find out how many times Anne went down the slide.

30 - 9 = 21

### 4
We know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply Anne's times by 4.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows.

There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows initially is:
10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

### 2
Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
200 cows (initial) + 40 cows (new) = 240 cows

### 3
He then divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, so each stall gets:
40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows

### 4
Now, we need to find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls. We already know that each stall has 20 cows initially and 4 new cows.

So, the total number of cows in one stall is:
20 cows (initial) + 4 cows (new) = 24 cows

### 5
To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

To find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately.

Each penny is worth $0.01, each nickel is worth $0.05, each dime is worth $0.10, and each dollar bill is worth $1.00.

### 2
We will start by calculating the total value of the pennies. We have 100 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01.

Total value of pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1.00

### 3
Next, we will calculate the total value of the nickels. We have 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05.

Total value of nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00

### 4
Now, we will calculate the total value of the dimes. We have 20 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10.

Total value of dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2.00

### 5
Finally, we will calculate the total value of the dollar bills. We have 40 dollar bills, and each dollar bill is worth $1.00.

Total value of dollar bills = 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

### 6
Now, we will add up the total value of all the coins and bills to find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank.

Total amount of money = Total value of pennies + Total value of nickels + Total value of dimes + Total value of dollar bills
Total amount of money = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00
Total amount of money = $45.00

### 7
Therefore, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.

### 8
We can also calculate the total amount of money by adding up the values of all the coins and bills in cents.

Total value of pennies in cents = 100 * 1 = 100 cents
Total value of nickels in cents = 40 * 5 = 200 cents
Total value of dimes in cents = 20 * 10 = 200 cents
Total value of dollar bills in cents = 40 * 100 = 4000 cents

### 9
Now, we will add up the total value of all the coins and bills in cents.

Total amount of money in cents = Total value of pennies in cents + Total value of nickels in cents + Total value of dimes in cents + Total value of dollar bills in cents
Total amount of money in cents = 100 + 200 + 200 + 4000
Total amount of money in cents = 4500 cents

### 10
To convert the total amount of money from cents to dollars, we will divide the total amount of money in cents by 100.

Total amount of money in dollars = Total amount of money in cents / 100
Total amount of money in dollars = 4500 / 100
Total amount of money in dollars = 45

To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the tree.

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each section is 10 feet long. We can find the total number of sections by dividing the height of the tree by the length of each section.

### 2
We will divide the height of the tree (200 feet) by the length of each section (10 feet) to get the total number of sections.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

### 3
Now that we know the total number of sections, we can calculate the total weight of the tree. Each section weighs 400 pounds.

### 4
We will multiply the total number of sections (20) by the weight of each section (400 pounds) to get the total weight of the tree.

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

### 5
However, we are told that termites ate 30% of the wood. This means that the weight we calculated is 130% of the actual weight, since 100% - 30% = 70%.

### 6
To find the actual weight of the tree, we need to divide the calculated weight by 1.3 (which is 130% expressed as a decimal).

### 7
We will divide the calculated weight (8000 pounds) by 1.3 to get the actual weight of the tree.

8000 pounds / 1.3 = 6153.85 pounds

### 8
Since we are asked for the weight in pounds, we can round the result to the nearest whole number if necessary.

### 9
However, in this case, we will keep the result as a decimal to ensure accuracy.

The final result is the actual weight of the tree after the termites ate 30% of its wood.

It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.

**Step 2** Calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.
It takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

**Step 3** Calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken.
After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

**Step 4** Calculate the total time it takes to have cooked chicken.
The total time is the sum of the time it takes to heat up the oil to 300 degrees, the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, and the time it takes to cook the chicken.
Total time = 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes.

We need to calculate the total number of windows in John's two houses.

### Step 1. Calculate the number of windows in one bedroom
Each bedroom has 2 windows.

### Step 2. Calculate the total number of windows in one house
There are 3 bedrooms in each house, so the total number of windows in one house is:
3 bedrooms * 2 windows per bedroom = 6 windows
Additionally, there are 4 windows not connected to bedrooms in each house.
So, the total number of windows in one house is:
6 windows + 4 windows = 10 windows

### Step 3. Calculate the total number of windows in both houses
Since there are two houses, the total number of windows is:
10 windows per house * 2 houses = 20 windows

To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the total number of lines for each scene and the solo song.

Each scene and the solo song have a certain number of lines, and we need to find out how many of those lines are Sean's.

### 2
First, let's calculate the number of lines in the first scene. We know that the first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, which has 54 lines.

So, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.

### 3
However, only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's. To find out how many lines are Sean's, we need to divide the total number of lines in the first scene by 3.

Sean's lines in the first scene = 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

### 4
Next, let's calculate the number of lines in the second scene. We know that the second scene has six more lines than the solo song, which has 54 lines.

So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.

### 5
However, four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's. To find out how many lines are Sean's, we need to multiply the total number of lines in the second scene by 4/5.

Sean's lines in the second scene = (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines.

### 6
Now, let's calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize. We need to add up the number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's, the number of lines in the second scene that are Sean's, and the number of lines in the solo song.

Total lines = 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to understand their current ages. We know that the sum of their ages is 20.

### 2
Let's assume Mico's age is x and Marco's age is 20 - x, since their ages add up to 20.

### 3
In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

### 4
Simplifying the expressions, Mico's age in 10 years will be x + 10 and Marco's age in 10 years will be 30 - x.

### 5
To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to add their ages together: (x + 10) + (30 - x).

### 6
Simplifying the expression, we can see that x cancels out: (x + 10) + (30 - x) = 40.

### 7
Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

We are given two pieces of information about Ruby and Sam's ages. We need to use this information to find Sam's current age.

### Step 1. Define Variables
Let's define variables to represent Ruby and Sam's current ages. Let R be Ruby's current age and S be Sam's current age.

### 

### Step 2. Express Relationship Between Ruby and Sam's Ages
We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be expressed as an equation: R = 6S.

### 

### Step 3. Express Relationship Between Ruby and Sam's Ages in 9 Years
In 9 years, Ruby will be R + 9 years old, and Sam will be S + 9 years old. We are given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be expressed as an equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

### 

### Step 4. Simplify the Equation
We can simplify the equation by distributing the 3 on the right-hand side: R + 9 = 3S + 27.

### 

### Step 5. Substitute R = 6S into the Equation
We can substitute R = 6S into the equation: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27.

### 

### Step 6. Solve for S
We can solve for S by subtracting 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27. Then, subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18. Finally, divide both sides by 3: S = 6.

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 12 + 24 + 3 = 39.

### 2
Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy.

39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

There are 12 team members, and each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people is 12 + 24 + 3 = 39.

286,"**Step 1** Calculate the total value of the quarters Kelly has.
Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is 5 x 25 = 125 cents.

 

**Step 2** Calculate the total value of the dimes Kelly has.
Kelly has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

 

**Step 3** Add the total value of the quarters and dimes to find Kelly's total amount of money.
The total value of the quarters is 125 cents, and the total value of the dimes is 20 cents. So, Kelly's total amount of money is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

 

**Step 4** Subtract the cost of the can of pop from Kelly's total amount of money to find out how many cents she will have left.
The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. So, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.

The weight of each flagstone is 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones to be transported.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds
There are 80 flagstones to be transported


### 2. Multiply the weight of each flagstone by the total number of flagstones
To find the total weight of the flagstones, we multiply the weight of each flagstone by the total number of flagstones.

Total weight = weight of each flagstone * total number of flagstones
Total weight = 75 * 80
Total weight = 6000 pounds


### 3. Determine the maximum weight that each truck can carry
Each delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.

Each truck can carry 2000 pounds


### 4. Divide the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight that each truck can carry
To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight that each truck can carry.

Number of trucks = total weight / maximum weight per truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3


### 5. Round up to the nearest whole number if necessary
Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number if necessary.

No rounding is necessary in this case, as the result is a whole number.

To solve this problem, we need to first find the time taken by the car in the fast lane to cover 480 miles.

### 2
The car in the fast lane is traveling at a speed of 60 miles/hour. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken.

### 3
Plugging in the values, we get: Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

### 4
Now, we know that the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

### 5
Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a slower speed, it will take longer to cover the same distance.

### 6
We can use the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

### 7
Plugging in the values, we get: Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

### 8
Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

### 9
This is because the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, resulting in a longer travel time.

### 10
We have successfully calculated the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

 

### 2. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars given to adults
Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

 

### 3. Calculate the remaining number of chocolate bars after giving to adults
The remaining number of chocolate bars is the total number of chocolate bars minus the number of chocolate bars given to adults. So, the remaining number of chocolate bars is 40 - 24 = 16.

 

### 4. Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get
The remaining number of chocolate bars is to be shared equally among the children. There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.

 

### 5. Verify the calculation
To verify the calculation, we can check if the total number of chocolate bars given to adults and the children is equal to the total number of chocolate bars available. The total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 24, and the total number of chocolate bars given to children is 8 * 2 = 16. The total number of chocolate bars given to adults and children is 24 + 16 = 40, which is equal to the total number of chocolate bars available.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each son will wash and then subtract that from the total number of oranges Will bought.

### 2
First, let's find out how old the youngest son is. Since he is half as old as the oldest son, we can calculate his age by dividing the oldest son's age by 2.

### 3
The oldest son is 8 years old, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

### 4
Now, we know that each son will wash as many oranges as they are years old. So, the oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges.

### 5
To find out the total number of oranges washed, we need to add the number of oranges washed by each son. total_oranges_washed = 8 + 4 = 12

### 6
Since Will bought 15 oranges, we can find out the number of oranges left unwashed by subtracting the total number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges bought. oranges_left_unwashed = 15 - 12 = 3

### 2
On the first day, Darren does 50 squats. On the second day, he does 10 fewer squats than on the first day. So, the total number of squats on the second day is 50 - 10 = 40.

### 3
On the first day, Darren does 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he doubles the number of dumbbell presses. So, the total number of dumbbell presses on the second day is 20 * 2 = 40.

### 4
To find the total count of pushups, we add the number of pushups on the first day (100) and the number of pushups on the second day (120). So, the total number of pushups is 100 + 120 = 220.

### 5
To find the total count of squats, we add the number of squats on the first day (50) and the number of squats on the second day (40). So, the total number of squats is 50 + 40 = 90.

To find out how much money Carmen spent on the antique desk, we need to understand the bidding pattern. 

She starts with an opening bid of $200 and then bids after each of the 3 other people. The bids rise by $50 each time.


### 2
Let's assume the first person bids $250, which is $50 more than Carmen's initial bid. Then, Carmen bids $300, which is $50 more than the first person's bid.


### 3
The second person bids $350, which is $50 more than Carmen's previous bid. Then, Carmen bids $400, which is $50 more than the second person's bid.


### 4
The third person bids $450, which is $50 more than Carmen's previous bid. Then, Carmen bids $500, which is $50 more than the third person's bid.


### 5
After the third person's bid, Carmen wins the auction. So, the final bid is $500.


### 6
Since Carmen started with a bid of $200 and bid $50 more each time, we can calculate the total amount she spent as follows:


### 7
Carmen's bids are $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, and $500. We can calculate the total amount she spent by adding these bids together.


### 8
Total amount spent = $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $400 + $450 + $500 = $3050


### 9
However, we need to consider that the other three people each bid once. Their bids are $250, $350, and $450.


### 10
We need to subtract these bids from the total amount spent to find out how much money Carmen spent on the desk.


### 11
Total amount spent by others = $250 + $350 + $450 = $1050

Now, we can subtract the total amount spent by others from the total amount spent by Carmen to find out how much money she spent on the desk.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the folding process of a tabloid. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two identical halves.

Each half of the paper will be used to print two pages of the tabloid: one on the front and one on the back.

### 2
Since each half of the paper is used to print two pages, we can calculate the total number of pages that can be printed from one piece of paper.

Let's assume we have a piece of paper with 32 pages printed on it. We can divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the number of pages printed on each half of the paper.

### 3
However, we need to consider that the first and last pages of the tabloid are printed on the back of the paper, while the remaining pages are printed on the front.

This means that the first and last pages are shared by two halves of the paper, while the remaining pages are printed on one half of the paper each.

### 4
To calculate the total number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each half of the paper.

Let's break it down:

* The first and last pages are printed on the back of the paper, which means they are shared by two halves of the paper.
* The remaining 30 pages are printed on the front of the paper, which means they are printed on one half of the paper each.

### 5
Since the first and last pages are shared by two halves of the paper, we can count them as 1 piece of paper.

The remaining 30 pages are printed on one half of the paper each, which means we need 30 pieces of paper for these pages.

### 6
However, we need to consider that the first and last pages are printed on the back of the paper, which means they are shared by two halves of the paper.

This means that we need to add 1 more piece of paper to account for the first and last pages.

### 7
Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed is 30 (for the remaining pages) + 1 (for the first and last pages) = 31.

### 8
However, we need to consider that the first and last pages are printed on the back of the paper, which means they are shared by two halves of the paper.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we first need to determine how many eggs they eat in a day.

The family consists of 5 members, with 3 members eating 3 eggs each day and the remaining 2 members eating 2 eggs each day.

### 2
Let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the 3 members who eat 3 eggs each day.

3 members * 3 eggs per member = 9 eggs per day

### 3
Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the 2 members who eat 2 eggs each day.

2 members * 2 eggs per member = 4 eggs per day

### 4
To find the total number of eggs eaten by the family in a day, we need to add the number of eggs eaten by the 3 members and the 2 members.

9 eggs per day + 4 eggs per day = 13 eggs per day

### 5
Since the family eats eggs every day, we need to multiply the total number of eggs eaten in a day by 7 to find the total number of eggs eaten in a week.

13 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 91 eggs per week

### 6
Therefore, the family consumes 91 eggs in a week.

### 7
To confirm our answer, let's calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the family in a week using a different approach.

3 members * 3 eggs per member * 7 days per week = 63 eggs
2 members * 2 eggs per member * 7 days per week = 28 eggs
Total eggs per week = 63 eggs + 28 eggs = 91 eggs

### 8
Both approaches confirm that the family consumes 91 eggs in a week.

To find the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

### 2
The length of the pool is given as 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height (depth) is 5 feet. We can plug these values into the formula to find the volume.

### 3
Volume = length x width x height
Volume = 6 x 4 x 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

### 4
Now that we know the volume of the pool, we can calculate the cost of filling it. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot.

### 5
To find the total cost, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot.

### 6
Total cost = volume x cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 x $0.1
Total cost = $12

There were 25 men and 15 women at the party. To find the total number of people, we add the number of men and women together.

25 (men) + 15 (women) = 40 (total people)


### Step 2. Calculate the number of people who left the party
1/4 of the total number of people left the party. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4.

40 (total people) * 1/4 = 10 (people left)


### Step 3. Calculate the number of men who left the party
We know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of men who left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of men.

25 (total men) - 22 (men stayed) = 3 (men left)


### Step 4. Calculate the number of women who left the party
Since 10 people left the party in total, and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is the difference between the total number of people who left and the number of men who left.

10 (people left) - 3 (men left) = 7 (women left)


### Step 5. Calculate the number of women who are left at the party
We know that there were 15 women at the party initially, and 7 of them left. To find the number of women who are left, we subtract the number of women who left from the total number of women.

15 (total women) - 7 (women left) = 8 (women left)

To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first need to calculate the total number of ruined castles.

There are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40% of them are ruins. To find 40% of 220, we multiply 220 by 0.4.

#### 
220 * 0.4 = 88

### 2
Now that we know there are 88 ruined castles, we need to find half of this number, as half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

To find half of 88, we divide 88 by 2.

#### 
88 / 2 = 44

### 3
The result from step 2 is the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The total cost of Furniture United's offer includes the advance payment and the 6 monthly installments.

### 2
First, let's calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:

- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Each group will have x students, and the smallest group will have x - 10 students.

### Step 2. The total number of students in the class is 200.
We can write an equation to represent the total number of students: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

### Step 3. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
Combine the x terms: 2x + x = 3x. The equation becomes 3x - 10 = 200.

### Step 4. Add 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x.
This will give us 3x = 210.

### Step 5. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x.
This will give us x = 70.

### Step 6. Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group.
Subtract 10 from x: 70 - 10 = 60.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 per tractor. So, their daily earnings from selling tractors were 10 * $100 = $1000.

### 3
Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at $220 per silo. So, their daily earnings from selling silos are 5 * $220 = $1100.

### 4
To find the percentage increase, we need to find the difference in daily earnings, which is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

### 5
Next, we divide the difference by the original daily earnings to get the ratio of the increase: $100 / $1000 = 0.1.

359,"**Step 1** Calculate the amount of money Billy has after buying candy
===========================================================

Billy starts with $10. After buying candy, he has some change left. We need to find out how much candy he bought first.

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the candy
------------------------------------------

Let's assume Billy bought x pounds of candy. The total cost of the candy is $1.5x.

**Step 3** Calculate the amount of change Billy has
---------------------------------------------

The amount of change Billy has is the initial amount of money minus the cost of the candy: $10 - $1.5x.

**Step 4** Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on gumballs
---------------------------------------------------------

Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. The amount of money he spent on gumballs is 0.5 * ($10 - $1.5x).

**Step 5** Calculate the number of gumballs Billy bought
---------------------------------------------------

We know that Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05. The total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

**Step 6** Set up an equation to find the amount of change Billy has
---------------------------------------------------------

The amount of money Billy spent on gumballs is equal to the total cost of the gumballs: 0.5 * ($10 - $1.5x) = $2.

**Step 7** Solve the equation to find the amount of change Billy has
---------------------------------------------------------

Solving the equation, we get: $10 - $1.5x = $4. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $20 - 3x = $8. Subtract $20 from both sides: -3x = -$12. Divide both sides by -3: x = $4.

**Step 8** Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy
---------------------------------------------------------

The amount of money Billy spent on candy is the initial amount of money minus the amount of change he has: $10 - $4 = $6.

**Step 9** Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought
---------------------------------------------------------

The total cost of the candy is $6, and each pound of candy costs $1.5. The number of pounds of candy Billy bought is $6 / $1.5 = 4.

There are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls. To find the number of boys, we multiply the number of girls by 2.

There are 6 girls, so the number of boys is 6 * 2 = 12.

## 

**Step 2** Calculate the total number of kids in the park
To find the total number of kids, we add the number of girls and the number of boys together.

The number of girls is 6, and the number of boys is 12. So, the total number of kids is 6 + 12 = 18.

To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored in the first two tests.

She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test.

### 2
We add the points from the first two tests to find the total points she has so far.

15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33 points

### 3
Since Jane needs a total of at least 42 points to pass, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required.

42 (required points) - 33 (points scored so far) = 9 points

### 4
This means Jane needs to score at least 9 points on the third test to reach the total of 42 points required to pass.

### 5
However, since we are looking for the minimum number of points, we consider the case where she scores exactly 9 points on the third test.

### 6
In this case, the total points she will have after the third test will be the sum of the points she has already scored and the points she scores on the third test.

33 (points scored so far) + 9 (points on the third test) = 42 points

### 7
This confirms that scoring 9 points on the third test will give Jane a total of 42 points, which is the minimum required to pass.

### 8
Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass is 9.

### 9
This is the minimum number of points she needs to score on the third test to meet the requirement of at least 42 points.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the number of people kicked out for each reason.

### 2
Let's start by calculating the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We are given that this number equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5.

### 3
Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of people kicked out for shoplifting as follows:

- Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = (4 * 3) - 5
- Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 12 - 5
- Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 7

### 4
Next, we need to calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence. We are given that this number is three times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.

### 5
Using the number of people kicked out for shoplifting (7), we can calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence as follows:

- Number of people kicked out for physical violence = 3 * 7
- Number of people kicked out for physical violence = 21

### 6
Now, we need to calculate the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

- Total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks = 3
- Total number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 7
- Total number of people kicked out for physical violence = 21
- Total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence = 3 + 7 + 21
- Total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence = 31

### 7
We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out.

- Number of people kicked out for other reasons = Total number of people kicked out - Total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence
- Number of people kicked out for other reasons = 50 - 31

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and then add them together.

### 2
First, let's find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples, we can divide the total amount earned by the price per apple.

### 3
Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount earned / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

### 4
On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

### 5
On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 12 apples. So, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

### 6
Now, let's add up the number of apples picked each day to find the total number of apples picked over the three days.

### 7
Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

### 8
Therefore, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.

### 9
We can also verify our answer by checking if the total amount earned from selling the apples matches the expected amount. The total amount earned from selling the apples picked on Monday is $56. The total amount earned from selling the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday is (12 + 24) * $4 = $96. The total amount earned from selling all the apples is $56 + $96 = $152.

To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on her project.

She spent 4 hours writing a song, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

### 2
Next, she spent half the time recording the song, which is 4 / 2 = 2 hours or 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

### 3
Then, she spent 90 minutes editing the song.

### 4
Now, we add up the time spent on each activity to find the total time: 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

### 5
To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

To find out how much energy Mel saves, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day.

### 2
The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total energy used per day is 900 watts/hour * 24 hours = 21600 watts.

### 3
However, we are asked to find the energy used in kilowatts. Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, we need to convert the energy used per day from watts to kilowatts. 21600 watts / 1000 = 21.6 kilowatts.

### 4
Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day. So, the new time he uses the air conditioner per day is 24 hours - 5 hours = 19 hours.

### 5
The new energy used per day is 900 watts/hour * 19 hours = 17100 watts.

### 6
Converting the new energy used per day from watts to kilowatts, we get 17100 watts / 1000 = 17.1 kilowatts.

### 7
The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used per day and the new energy used per day. Energy saved per day = 21.6 kilowatts - 17.1 kilowatts = 4.5 kilowatts.

### 8
To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30. Total energy saved = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

### 9
Since we are asked to find the energy saved in 30 days, we don't need to convert it to any other unit.

### 10
Therefore, the total energy saved in 30 days is 135 kilowatts.

To solve this problem, we first need to find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house.

### 2
We are given that Allan has a total of 40 cannolis in his house.

### 3
Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 times the number of cannolis.

### 4
So, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

### 5
Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store, so the new total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

### 6
Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new total number of corns is 100 - 40 = 60.

### 7
Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house.

### 8
The combined total is the sum of the new total number of corns and the new total number of cannolis.

### 9
So, the combined total is 60 + 100 = 160.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their hourly wages.

### 2
In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This means each employee worked 40 hours in a week and was paid $15 per hour.

### 3
To find the total amount paid to each employee in May, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked in a week: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week.

### 4
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly wage by 4 to find the total amount paid to each employee in May: $600/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400/month.

### 5
Now, we multiply the monthly wage by the number of employees to find the total amount paid to all employees in May: $2400/month * 40 employees = $96000.

### 6
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left the company. To find the number of employees who left, we multiply 40 by 1/4: 40 * 1/4 = 10 employees.

### 7
Since 10 employees left, the number of employees remaining in June is 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

### 8
The hourly wage and workweek remain the same in June, so we can use the same calculations as in May to find the total amount paid to each employee in June: $600/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400/month.

### 9
Now, we multiply the monthly wage by the number of employees remaining in June to find the total amount paid to all employees in June: $2400/month * 30 employees = $72000.

===========================================================

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night as a treat. To find out the total number of cookies she eats in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days.

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

**Step 2** Determine the number of dozens of cookies needed
=====================================================

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she eats in 30 days by 12 to find out the number of dozens of cookies she needs.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

**Step 3** Consider the need for extra cookies

Since Shannon will be storing the cookies in the freezer, it's a good idea to make a few extra cookies to account for any that might get damaged or eaten accidentally.

However, in this case, we don't have any information about the likelihood of cookies getting damaged or eaten accidentally, so we will assume that the calculated number of cookies is sufficient.

To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse.

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

### 2
To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage.

Discount amount = Regular price * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $20 * 30%
Discount amount = $20 * 0.30
Discount amount = $6

### 3
Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we need to multiply the discount amount by 4 to find the total discount.

Total discount = Discount amount * Number of blouses
Total discount = $6 * 4
Total discount = $24

### 4
Now, we need to find the regular price of all 4 blouses.

Regular price of 4 blouses = Regular price per blouse * Number of blouses
Regular price of 4 blouses = $20 * 4
Regular price of 4 blouses = $80

### 5
To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we subtract the total discount from the regular price of all 4 blouses.

Total cost = Regular price of 4 blouses - Total discount
Total cost = $80 - $24
Total cost = $56

### 6
Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

### 7
We can also express this as a calculation:

Total cost = (Regular price per blouse * Number of blouses) - (Regular price per blouse * Number of blouses * Discount percentage)
Total cost = ($20 * 4) - ($20 * 4 * 0.30)
Total cost = $80 - $24
Total cost = $56

### 8
This calculation confirms that the total cost of the discounted blouses is indeed $56.

### 9
We can also express this as a formula:

Total cost = (Regular price per blouse * Number of blouses) * (1 - Discount percentage)
Total cost = ($20 * 4) * (1 - 0.30)
Total cost = $80 * 0.70

To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and create equations based on the relationships between the number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister.

### 2
Let's denote the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the tallest trees as T, from the shortest trees as S, and from the average trees as A.

### 3
According to the problem, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. This can be represented as:

- T = 30
- S = 30 / 2 = 15

### 4
Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. This can be represented as:

- Sister's T = 2 * T = 2 * 30 = 60
- Sister's S = 3 * S = 3 * 15 = 45

### 5
Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can create an equation to represent this:

- Total = Joanne's T + Joanne's S + Joanne's A + Sister's T + Sister's S
- 500 = 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45

### 6
Simplifying the equation, we get:

- 500 = 150 + A

### 7
To find the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to isolate A:

- A = 500 - 150
- A = 350

### 8
Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

### 9
However, we need to verify if this solution is correct by checking if the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is indeed 500.

### 10
Let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

- Total = Joanne's T + Joanne's S + Joanne's A + Sister's T + Sister's S

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that the total number of heads is 180, which means the total number of camels and dromedaries is also 180.

### 2
Since each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, the total number of humps is equal to the number of camels multiplied by 2 plus the number of dromedaries multiplied by 1.

### 3
We can write the equation for the total number of humps as 2C + D = 304.

### 4
We also know that the total number of heads is equal to the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries, which can be written as C + D = 180.

### 5
We can solve the second equation for C, which gives us C = 180 - D.

### 6
Now we can substitute the expression for C from step 5 into the first equation from step 3, which gives us 2(180 - D) + D = 304.

### 7
Expanding the equation from step 6, we get 360 - 2D + D = 304.

### 8
Combining like terms in the equation from step 7, we get 360 - D = 304.

### 9
Now we can solve the equation from step 8 for D, which gives us D = 360 - 304.

Let's denote Peter's locker size as P. We know that P = 0.25Z.

**Step 4** Substitute the expression for Z from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3.
Substituting Z = 0.5T into P = 0.25Z, we get P = 0.25(0.5T).

**Step 5** Simplify the equation from Step 4.
P = 0.25(0.5T) simplifies to P = 0.125T.

First, let's calculate the total number of cats taken away by the four boats. Each boat carried 5 cats, so the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.

 

### 2
Now, let's calculate the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats took away 20 cats. The initial number of cats was 50, so the number of cats remaining is 50 - 20 = 30.

 

### 3
Next, let's calculate 3/5 of the remaining cats that ran after the mouse. 3/5 of 30 is (3/5) * 30 = 18.

 

### 4
Now, let's calculate the number of cats remaining on the rock after 18 cats ran after the mouse. The number of cats remaining is 30 - 18 = 12.

We can also verify our answer by adding the number of cats taken away by the boats (20) and the number of cats that ran after the mouse (18) to the initial number of cats (50). This gives us 50 + 20 + 18 = 88, which is not correct. However, we can add the number of cats taken away by the boats (20) and the number of cats that ran after the mouse (18) to the number of cats remaining on the rock (12).

Bill signed up for a streaming service with a special introductory deal. 
The deal had three different price rates: $8 for the first 6 months, $12 for the next 8 months, and $14 for the rest of the time.

### 2
First, we need to calculate the total cost for the first 6 months at $8 per month.
- The cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

### 3
Next, we calculate the total cost for the next 8 months at $12 per month.
- The cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

### 4
Then, we need to find out how many months are left in 2 years after the first 14 months.
- There are 24 months in 2 years.
- After the first 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left.

### 5
Now, we calculate the total cost for the remaining 10 months at $14 per month.
- The cost for the remaining 10 months is 10 * $14 = $140.

### 6
Finally, we add up the costs for the three different periods to find the total cost for 2 years.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

### 2
Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6 / 3 = $2.

### 3
Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the jogger jeans must have been on sale by $2. This means the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

### 4
The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28.

### 5
To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to subtract the original price of the tattered jeans from the original price of the jogger jeans.

### 6
The difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $24 - $28 = -$4.

### 7
However, since we are looking for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to take the absolute value of the difference.

### 8
The absolute value of -$4 is $4.

### 9
Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

### 10
This makes sense, since the jogger jeans were originally $6 more expensive than the tattered jeans, but Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, so the jogger jeans were actually $4 more expensive than the tattered jeans after the sale.

#### 1. Calculate the capacity of the buses
The capacity of each bus is 60 employees. There are 4 buses rented.
So, the total capacity of the buses is 4 * 60 = 240 employees.

There are 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees each. 
So, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 * 30 = 180 employees.

#### 2. Calculate the capacity of the minivans
There are 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees each. 
So, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

#### 3. Add up the capacities of all the vehicles
To find the total capacity, we need to add up the capacities of the buses, minibusses, and minivans.
Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150

Lillian has a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden, 3 of which she made herself and 3 of which she bought from a store.

Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day.

However, Lillian noticed that the bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

### 

**Step 2** **Determining the Number of Birds Attracted by Store-Bought Feeders**
Let's assume that the store-bought bird feeders attract x birds each.

Since the bird feeders made by Lillian attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, the bird feeders made by Lillian attract x + 10 birds each.

### 

**Step 3** **Calculating the Total Number of Birds Attracted by Store-Bought Feeders**
There are 3 store-bought bird feeders, each attracting x birds.

So, the total number of birds attracted by store-bought feeders is 3x.

### 

**Step 4** **Calculating the Total Number of Birds Attracted by Homemade Feeders**
There are 3 homemade bird feeders, each attracting x + 10 birds.

So, the total number of birds attracted by homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

### 

**Step 5** **Simplifying the Expression for Homemade Feeders**
3(x + 10) can be simplified to 3x + 30.

So, the total number of birds attracted by homemade feeders is 3x + 30.

### 

**Step 6** **Calculating the Total Number of Birds Attracted by All Feeders**
The total number of birds attracted by all feeders is the sum of the birds attracted by store-bought feeders and homemade feeders.

So, the total number of birds attracted by all feeders is 3x + (3x + 30).

### 

**Step 7** **Simplifying the Expression for Total Birds**
3x + (3x + 30) can be simplified to 6x + 30.

### 

**Step 8** **Determining the Value of x**
Since each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, the store-bought bird feeders also attract 20 birds each.

So, x = 20.

### 

**Step 9** **Calculating the Total Number of Birds Attracted by All Feeders**
Now that we know the value of x, we can substitute it into the expression for total birds.

6x + 30 becomes 6(20) + 30.

### 

**Step 10** **Simplifying the Expression for Total Birds**
6(20) + 30 can be simplified to 120 + 30.

=====================================

Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He plans to sell his Pokémon cards for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash.

He needs to sell enough cards to cover the cost of the ticket ($100) and have $50 left over for spending cash.

### Step 2: Determine the Total Amount Kenny Needs to Earn
--------------------------------------------------------

Kenny needs to earn a total of $100 (ticket cost) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Cards Kenny Needs to Sell
---------------------------------------------------------

Since Kenny sells each card for $1.5, we can calculate the number of cards he needs to sell by dividing the total amount he needs to earn ($150) by the price per card ($1.5).

Number of cards to sell = Total amount / Price per card
= $150 / $1.5
= 100 cards

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Cards Kenny Keeps
---------------------------------------------------

Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards. Let's call the total number of cards he starts with ""x"". Then, the number of cards he keeps is x/3.

### Step 5: Calculate the Number of Cards Kenny Sells
---------------------------------------------------

Since Kenny sells 100 cards, the number of cards he sells is 100.

### Step 6: Set Up an Equation to Represent the Situation
---------------------------------------------------------

We know that the total number of cards Kenny starts with (x) is equal to the number of cards he keeps (x/3) plus the number of cards he sells (100).

x = x/3 + 100

### Step 7: Solve the Equation
-----------------------------

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction.

3x = x + 300

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

2x = 300

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 150

### Step 8: Interpret the Result
------------------------------

Kenny starts with 150 cards.

### Step 9: Check the Result
---------------------------

We can check our result by plugging it back into the original equation:

150 = 150/3 + 100
150 = 50 + 100
150 = 150

This confirms that our result is correct.

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. We know that he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left.

### 2
Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 0.01x

### 3
To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 0.01x + 5

### 4
Subtract 0.01x from both sides:

0.99x = 5

### 5
Divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

### 7
The total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Since George spent $5 in total, we can subtract the cost of chips from $5 to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

### 9
We know that each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

### 10
Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will round up to the nearest whole number because George must have bought at least 5 candy bars to have spent $3.80 on them.

Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 yards by 3 feet per yard.

The length of the room in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

## 

**Step 2** Find the width of the room in feet
We know that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width) to find the width.

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9.

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

## 

**Step 3** Calculate the perimeter of the room
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(Length + Width). We can plug in the values we found for the length and width.

To find out how much hay the horse eats, we need to know the distance it runs. Since we know the speed and time, we can use the formula distance = speed * time.

We have the speed (32MPH) and time (30 minutes), but we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

**Step 2** Calculate the distance the horse runs
Now that we have the time in hours, we can calculate the distance the horse runs using the formula distance = speed * time.

distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
distance = 16 miles

**Step 3** Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats
For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Since the horse runs 16 miles, we can calculate the total amount of hay it eats:

hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
hay = 8 bails

**Step 4** Calculate the cost of the hay
A bail of hay costs $3, so we can calculate the total cost of the hay:

cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
cost = $24

**Step 5** Calculate the total amount of money Michael has
Michael has six $5 bills, so we can calculate the total amount of money he has:

total money = 6 * $5
total money = $30

**Step 6** Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay
To find out how much change Michael has, we need to subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has:

change = total money - cost
change = $30 - $24
change = $6

The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sneakers.

The cost per sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12.

**Step 2** Calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday
The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday. To find the revenue from the flash sale, we need to multiply the number of sneakers sold by the selling price.

The revenue from the flash sale is 17 x $20 = $340.

**Step 3** Calculate the revenue from selling the rest of the sneakers to the department store
The salesman sold the rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each. To find the revenue from selling the rest of the sneakers, we need to multiply the number of sneakers sold by the selling price.

The revenue from selling the rest of the sneakers is 31 x $25 = $775.

**Step 4** Calculate the total revenue
To find the total revenue, we need to add the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from selling the rest of the sneakers.

The total revenue is $340 + $775 = $1115.

**Step 5** Calculate the profit
To find the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of filling one helium balloon before the price increase.

### 2
We know that the total cost of filling 20 helium balloons was $900. To find the cost of one balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons.

### 3
Cost of one balloon before price increase = Total cost / Number of balloons
= $900 / 20
= $45

### 4
Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost of one balloon is the old cost plus the increase.

### 5
New cost of one balloon = Old cost + Increase
= $45 + $20
= $65

### 6
Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price.

### 7
Total cost = New cost of one balloon * Number of balloons

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. We need to find the total value of her jewels after trading 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.

She has 8 sapphires initially, and each sapphire is worth $800. So, the total value of her sapphires is:

8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the sapphires she trades is:

3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

She gets 2 rubies in return. Each ruby is worth $1200. So, the total value of the rubies she gets is:

2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

### 2
Now, let's calculate the total value of her jewels after the trade.

She has 5 sapphires left (8 - 3 = 5). The total value of these sapphires is:

5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

She also has 2 rubies. The total value of these rubies is:

2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

### 3
To find the total value of her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies.

Total value = $4000 + $2400 = $6400

### 4
However, we also need to consider the value of the 3 sapphires she traded for the rubies. We already calculated this value as $2400.

### 5
So, the total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she got, plus the value of the sapphires she traded.

Total value = $4000 + $2400 + $2400 = $8800

### 6
Therefore, the total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

### 7
We can also verify this by considering the value of the rubies she got. The value of the rubies is $2400, and the value of the sapphires she traded is also $2400.

### 8
Since the value of the rubies and the sapphires she traded is equal, the total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she got.

### 9
This is consistent with our previous calculation.

To find the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for the raised beds.

Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is:

* Width: 2 feet
* Length: 8 feet
* Height: 2 feet

The volume of each bed is calculated as: width * length * height = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is: 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

### 2
Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags required, we divide the total volume of soil required by the volume of each bag:

320 cubic feet (total volume) / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

### 3
Each bag of potting soil costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags required by the cost per bag:

160 bags * $12/bag = $1920

### 4
Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil required for the raised beds is $1920.

### 5
We can also calculate the total cost by considering the total volume of soil required and the cost per cubic foot of soil. However, this information is not provided in the problem.

### 6
Since we have already calculated the total cost in step 3, we can conclude that the total cost of the potting soil required for the raised beds is $1920.

### 7
We can also verify our answer by checking if the total number of bags required is a whole number. Since 320 is divisible by 2, the total number of bags required is indeed a whole number.

### 8
We can also check if the total cost is a whole number. Since 160 is divisible by 12, the total cost is indeed a whole number.

### 9
We can also consider the fact that the problem does not provide any information about the cost of transportation or any other expenses. Therefore, the total cost calculated is the only cost that we need to consider.

We can also conclude that the total cost of the potting soil required for the raised beds is $1920, and this is the final answer.

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. 

### 2
According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

### 3
We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. This can be represented as an equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

### 4
To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can start by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2.

### 5
Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get: x/2 = 3.

### 6
To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 2: x = 3 * 2.

### 7
Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get: x = 6.

### 8
Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get a total of 5 cookies.

### 9
This solution makes sense because if Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he gets 6/2 = 3 cookies for eating the carrot sticks, and 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room, which adds up to a total of 5 cookies.

### 10
So, the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat is 6.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.

There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the combined length of the remoras in feet is 12 / 12 = 1 foot.

There are 10 feet in 10 feet, so the combined length of the remoras as a fraction of the shark's body length is 1/10.

**Step 2** Convert the fraction to a percentage
To convert the fraction to a percentage, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100.

1 / 10 = 0.1
0.1 * 100 = 10%

**Step 3** Round the percentage to the nearest whole number
Since the percentage is already a whole number, no rounding is necessary.

**Step 4** Determine the final answer
The final answer is the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras.

There are 20 students who do not have desktop computers at home. This means that the remaining students have desktop computers at home.

## 
**Step 2** Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers at home, we can set up the following equation:

(3/4)x = number of students with desktop computers

## 
**Step 3** We know that the number of students without desktop computers is 20. Therefore, the number of students with desktop computers is x - 20.

## 
**Step 4** We can now set up an equation using the information from step 2 and step 3:

(3/4)x = x - 20

## 
**Step 5** To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 4(x - 20)

## 
**Step 6** Next, we can distribute the 4 on the right-hand side of the equation:

3x = 4x - 80

## 
**Step 7** Now, we can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation to get:

493,"### 1. Calculate the total number of razors Heather will get from 2 packs
Heather buys 2 packs of razors, and each pack contains 4 razors. So, the total number of razors she will get is 2 * 4 = 8.

 

### 2. Calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors before the discount
Each pack of razors costs $4.00. So, the total cost of 2 packs of razors is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

 

### 3. Apply the buy one get one free discount to the total cost
Since Heather buys 2 packs of razors, she gets one pack for free. So, she only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00.

 

### 4. Apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost
Heather has a $2.00 coupon, which she can use to reduce the cost of the razors. So, the total cost after applying the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

 

### 5. Convert the total cost to cents
Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert the total cost from dollars to cents. There are 100 cents in 1 dollar, so the total cost in cents is $2.00 * 100 = 200 cents.

 

### 6. Calculate the cost of each individual razor
Heather gets 8 razors from 2 packs. To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost in cents by the total number of razors. So, the cost of each individual razor is 200 cents / 8 = 25 cents.

To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between Brett's current age and Angela's age in four years.

Brett is currently 14 years old.

### 2
In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This means that Angela's age in four years will be 3 times 14.

### 3
We can calculate Angela's age in four years by multiplying 14 by 3.

Angela's age in four years = 14 * 3 = 42

### 4
Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find out how old she is now.

### 5
We can calculate Angela's current age by subtracting 4 from 42.

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38

### 6
Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

### 7
We can verify our answer by checking if Angela's age in four years is indeed three times Brett's current age.

Angela's age in four years = 42
Brett's current age = 14
42 = 3 * 14 (True)

### 8
Since our answer satisfies the given condition, we can be confident that Angela is currently 38 years old.

### 9
We can also check if our answer makes sense in the context of the problem. Since Brett is 14 years old, it is reasonable that his sister Angela is older than him.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, and Ashley brought 50 oranges. So, Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

 

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of oranges both Ashley and Brianne brought
To find the total number of oranges, we need to add the oranges Ashley brought (50) and the oranges Brianne brought (70). So, the total number of oranges is 50 + 70 = 120.

 

**Step 4** Calculate the number of greek orange pies they can make
One greek orange pie needs three oranges. To find the number of pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges (120) by the number of oranges needed for one pie (3). So, the number of pies is 120 / 3 = 40.

 

**Step 5** Check if there are any remaining oranges
Since 120 oranges are needed for 40 pies, and each pie needs 3 oranges, we can calculate the total oranges needed for 40 pies as 40 * 3 = 120. This means they have exactly enough oranges to make 40 pies, with no remaining oranges.

Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. 
To find the number of cookies Josh made, we need to divide the number of cookies Suzanne made by 4.
Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.

### Step 3. Determine the number of cookies Kelsie made
Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh.
To find the number of cookies Kelsie made, we need to multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2.
Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

We are given that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. We need to find out how many minutes Royce takes to do the same job.

### Step 2. Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60.

### Step 3. Calculate Rob's time in minutes
Rob's time in minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

### Step 4. Determine the time it takes for Royce to shingle a house
We are given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house.

### Step 5. Calculate double Rob's time
Double Rob's time = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes

### Step 6. Add 40 minutes to double Rob's time to find Royce's time
Royce's time = Double Rob's time + 40 minutes = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

### Step 7. Verify the calculation
We have calculated Royce's time by adding 40 minutes to double Rob's time.

To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house.

### 2
Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can assume that it would take twice as long to paint a whole house.

### 3
Therefore, it would take one person 5 * 2 = 10 days to paint a whole house.

### 4
Now, we need to determine how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

### 5
Since 5 people can work together to paint the house, we can divide the time it takes for one person to paint the house by the number of people.

### 6
So, it would take 5 people 10 / 5 = 2 days to paint a whole house.

### 7
Since we want to find the time in hours, we need to convert the days to hours.

### 8
There are 24 hours in a day, so we can multiply the number of days by 24 to get the total hours.

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas.

### 2
Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as ""x"". Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We are given that she has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20.

### 3
To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x - 2 = 20. We can do this by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 22.

### 4
Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find out how many chairs Jenna has. We are given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

### 5
Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas she has is 66 - 2 = 64.

### 6
Now we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

### 7
To find the total number of sofas and chairs that they have, we need to add up the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna.

### 8
The total number of sofas is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84.

### 9
The total number of chairs is 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88.

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for an unknown price. In total, he paid $48. We need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

### Step 1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set
To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to calculate the cost of the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid.

### 
Cost of CD = $4
Total amount paid = $48

### Step 2. Subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid
Subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid to find the cost of the headphone set.

### 
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

### Step 3. Calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set
Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

### 
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with headphone set = $44 / $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with headphone set = 11

### Step 4. Calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount paid
We also need to calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount paid.

### 
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with total amount paid = Total amount paid / Cost of CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with total amount paid = $48 / $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with total amount paid = 12

### Step 5. Calculate the difference between the two numbers
Now that we know how many CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set and the total amount paid, we can calculate the difference between the two numbers.

### 
Difference = Number of CDs Tom could have bought with total amount paid - Number of CDs Tom could have bought with headphone set

We need to find the current age difference between James and his cousin.

### Step 1. Define James' current age
Let's denote James' current age as J. Since James will turn 27 in 5 years, we can write an equation: J + 5 = 27.

### 

### Step 2. Solve for James' current age
We can solve the equation from step 1 to find James' current age: J = 27 - 5 = 22.

### 

### Step 3. Define the cousin's age in 8 years
Let's denote the cousin's current age as C. In 8 years, the cousin will be C + 8 years old.

### 

### Step 4. Write an equation for the cousin's age in 8 years
According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age in 8 years. We can write an equation: C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5.

### 

### Step 5. Substitute James' current age into the equation
We can substitute J = 22 into the equation from step 4: C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5.

### 

### Step 6. Simplify the equation
We can simplify the equation from step 5: C + 8 = 2(30) - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.

### 

### Step 7. Solve for the cousin's current age
We can solve the equation from step 6 to find the cousin's current age: C = 55 - 8 = 47.

### 

### Step 8. Calculate the age difference
We can calculate the age difference between James and his cousin: Age difference = C - J = 47 - 22 = 25.

Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as 4x dollars.

## 

### 2
The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. This means that the sum of the amounts Jeff and Brad get should equal 100 dollars. We can write this as an equation: x + 4x = 100.

## 

### 3
Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms. We can do this by adding x and 4x, which gives us 5x = 100.

## 

### 4
To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5. This gives us x = 100 / 5.

## 

### 5
Now, let's calculate the value of x. We can do this by dividing 100 by 5, which gives us x = 20.

## 

### 6
Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can find Jeff's amount by multiplying Brad's amount (x) by 4. This gives us Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20.

## 

### 7
Now, let's calculate Jeff's amount. We can do this by multiplying 4 by 20, which gives us Jeff's amount = 80.

### 8
Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of working days.

### 2
Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, so the total distance he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

### 3
Since Jeff has to work 5 times a week, we need to multiply the daily distance by 5 to get the total weekly distance.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the total weekly distance: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

### 5
However, we need to consider that Jeff walks to work and back home each day, so we need to multiply the daily distance by 2 to account for the round trip.

### 6
But, we already calculated the daily distance as 6 miles, which is the round trip distance.

### 7
So, we can directly multiply the daily round trip distance by the number of working days.

### 8
Therefore, the total weekly distance is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

### 9
This means that Jeff walks a total of 30 miles in a week.

To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months.

He lost 10 pounds per month, so we need to multiply the weight lost per month by the number of months.

### 2
Weight lost per month: 10 pounds
Number of months: 3

### 3
Total weight lost = weight lost per month * number of months
Total weight lost = 10 * 3
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

### 4
Since Mark's final weight was 70 pounds, we need to add the total weight he lost to his final weight to find his initial weight.

### 5
Initial weight = final weight + total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100 pounds

### 6
However, we need to consider that Mark lost weight over a period of 3 months, so we should also consider the weight he lost in the last month.

### 7
Weight lost in the last month: 10 pounds
Weight lost in the previous 2 months: 20 pounds
Total weight lost in the first 2 months: 20 pounds

### 8
Weight lost in the first 2 months = weight lost per month * 2
Weight lost in the first 2 months = 10 * 2
Weight lost in the first 2 months = 20 pounds

### 9
Since Mark's weight decreased by 10 pounds in the last month, we can assume that his weight was 80 pounds at the end of the second month.

### 10
Now, we can calculate Mark's initial weight by adding the weight he lost in the first 2 months to his weight at the end of the second month.

### 11
Initial weight = weight at the end of the second month + weight lost in the first 2 months
Initial weight = 80 + 20

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which is 10 * 4 = 40 cups.

### 4
Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of minutes Judy read in the first week in terms of pages
Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by dividing the total number of minutes she read in the first week by 1.5 and multiplying by 2. So, the total number of pages she read in the first week is (105 / 1.5) * 2 = 140 pages.

 

**Step 5** Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks
We know that Judy read a total of 100 pages in the second week. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

 

**Step 6** Calculate the total number of minutes Judy read in the second week
Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the total number of minutes she read in the second week by dividing the total number of pages she read in the second week by 2 and multiplying by 1.5. So, the total number of minutes she read in the second week is (100 / 2) * 1.5 = 75 minutes.

 

**Step 7** Verify the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks
We can verify the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks by calculating the total number of pages she read in the second week using the total number of minutes she read in the second week. So, the total number of pages she read in the second week is (75 / 1.5) * 2 = 100 pages.

 

**Step 8** Verify the total number of pages Judy read in the first week
We can verify the total number of pages Judy read in the first week by calculating the total number of pages she read in the first week using the total number of minutes she read in the first week. So, the total number of pages she read in the first week is (105 / 1.5) * 2 = 140 pages.

To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

### 2
We know that Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more than Mark and 45 more than Anna.

### 3
Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

### 4
We can write two equations based on the given information:

- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: 80 = M + 20
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: 80 = A + 45

### 5
Now, let's solve the first equation for M:

- 80 = M + 20
- M = 80 - 20
- M = 60

### 6
Now, let's solve the second equation for A:

- 80 = A + 45
- A = 80 - 45
- A = 35

### 7
Now that we know the number of goals scored by Mark (M = 60) and Anna (A = 35), we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

### 8
The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is the sum of the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna: 80 + 60 + 35

### 9
Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Liam made from selling lemonade.

### 2
Liam made $63 in total from selling lemonade.

### 3
Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mitchell made from selling lemonade.

### 4
Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade to find the total amount of money Mitchell made.

### 5
Total money made by Mitchell = Number of lemonades sold * Price per lemonade
Total money made by Mitchell = 21 * $4
Total money made by Mitchell = $84

### 6
Now that we know how much money both Liam and Mitchell made, we can find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam.

### 7
To do this, we subtract the total amount of money Liam made from the total amount of money Mitchell made.

### 8
Difference in money made = Total money made by Mitchell - Total money made by Liam
Difference in money made = $84 - $63
Difference in money made = $21

### 9
Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

### 10
This means that Mitchell's lemonade stand was more profitable than Liam's lemonade stand that weekend.

The oven is malfunctioning and the actual temperature is 468 when set to 450. We need to find the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to in order to achieve 520 degrees.

### 2. Calculate the percentage difference between the actual and set temperature
To find the percentage difference, we can use the formula: ((actual - set) / set) * 100.
Percentage difference = ((468 - 450) / 450) * 100 = (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

### 3. Determine the percentage difference for the target temperature
Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we can use the same percentage difference to find the target temperature.
Percentage difference for target temperature = 4%

### 4. Calculate the target temperature
To find the target temperature, we can use the formula: target = set + (set * percentage difference).
Target temperature = 520 + (520 * 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8

### 5. Round the target temperature to the nearest whole number
Since temperature cannot be set to a decimal value, we round the target temperature to the nearest whole number.
Rounded target temperature = 541

### 6. Verify the result
We can verify the result by checking if the actual temperature is 520 when the oven is set to 541.
Actual temperature = 541 + (541 * 0.04) = 541 + 21.64 = 562.64
Since the actual temperature is not 520, we need to adjust the target temperature.

### 7. Adjust the target temperature
We can adjust the target temperature by subtracting the difference between the actual and target temperatures.
Adjusted target temperature = 520 + (562.64 - 520) = 520 + 42.64 = 562.64

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts Pete will need for 90 days.

Each box of contacts lasts 45 days and contains 90 contacts. Since Pete needs contacts for 90 days, he will need 2 boxes.

### 2
Now, let's calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.

* Each box contains 90 contacts.
* 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 contacts.

### 3
Next, we need to find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.

* The original price of each box is $100.00.
* The discount is 10% of $100.00, which is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00.
* The discounted price of each box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
* The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the cost of each pair of contacts.

* The total number of contacts in 2 boxes is 180.
* Since each pair of contacts is used for 1 day, we need to divide the total number of contacts by 90 (the number of days).
* The number of pairs of contacts is 180 / 90 = 2.
* The cost of each pair of contacts is the total cost of 2 boxes divided by the number of pairs of contacts, which is $180.00 / 2 = $90.00.

### 5
Finally, we can conclude that the cost of each pair of contacts is $90.00.

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

 

**Step 2** Calculate the total calories burned during running
Hannah spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

 

**Step 3** Calculate the total calories burned
The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned during aerobics and running. So, the total calories burned is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

 

**Step 4** Determine the ratio of water to calories
Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. This means the ratio of water to calories is 100 ml / 200 calories.

 

**Step 5** Calculate the total amount of water needed
To find the total amount of water needed, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 and then multiply by 100. So, the total amount of water needed is (1600 / 200) * 100 = 800 ml.

 

**Step 6** Verify the calculation
We can verify the calculation by checking if the ratio of water to calories is maintained. If 200 calories require 100 ml of water, then 1600 calories should require (1600 / 200) * 100 ml of water, which is indeed 800 ml.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

### 2
We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

### 3
Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

G = 1.01B

### 4
Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

### 5
Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

### 6
Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

### 7
Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
= 0.99(1500)
= 1485

### 8
And the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
= 1.01(1500)
= 1515

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485

To find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to understand the growth pattern of the beanstalk. It doubles its height every day.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

### 2
We need to find the number of days it will take for the beanstalk to reach a height greater than 20 feet.

### 3
Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can start by calculating its height after each day.

- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

### 4
As we can see, on the third day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

### 5
However, we need to confirm if the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the second day.

- Day 2: 16 feet (shorter than Mark's window)
- Day 3: 32 feet (taller than Mark's window)

### 6
Since the beanstalk is shorter than Mark's window on the second day and taller on the third day, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

### 7
We can also confirm this by checking the height of the beanstalk on the second day and the third day.

- Day 2: 16 feet (shorter than Mark's window)
- Day 3: 32 feet (taller than Mark's window)

### 8
Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

### 9
We can also check if the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the fourth day.

- Day 4: 32 feet * 2 = 64 feet (taller than Mark's window)

### 10
However, we already know that the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the third day, so we don't need to check further.

We are given a triangle with three angles, and we need to find the measure of the largest angle. We know that the three angles add up to 180 degrees, and one angle is twice the smallest angle, while another angle is three times the smallest angle.

### Step 1. Let's denote the smallest angle as x
We can represent the other two angles in terms of x.

### Step 2. One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x
This is a direct relationship between the two angles.

### Step 3. One angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x
This is another direct relationship between the two angles.

### Step 4. The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees
We can write an equation based on this information: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

### Step 5. Combine like terms in the equation
This simplifies the equation to 6x = 180.

### Step 6. Solve for x
Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to get x = 30.

### Step 7. Find the other two angles
Now that we know x, we can find the other two angles: 2x = 60 and 3x = 90.

### Step 8. Determine the largest angle
The largest angle is 90 degrees.

### Step 9. Conclusion
The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The answer is 90",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints5MathFormat'}

We have 5 dogs in the store, so the total number of legs for the dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.

### 3
We have 2 cats in the store, so the total number of legs for the cats is 2 * 4 = 8.

Jamaal increases the weight by 50%. To find the new weight, we need to calculate 50% of the original weight and add it to the original weight.

The original weight is 8 pounds. 50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 x 8 = 4 pounds.

**Step 2** Calculate the new weight
Add the weight increase to the original weight to find the new weight. 
New weight = original weight + weight increase
New weight = 8 pounds + 4 pounds
New weight = 12 pounds

**Step 3** Calculate the weight after reduction
Jamaal finds the new weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that.

To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age.

### 2
We know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. This means that if we subtract 12 from 16, we will get her current age.

### 3
Let's calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16: 16 - 12 = 4

### 4
Now that we know Charmaine's current age is 4, we can find out how old she will be 4 years from now by adding 4 to her current age.

### 5
Let's calculate her age 4 years from now: 4 + 4 = 8

### 6
Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

### 7
This makes sense because if she will be 16 in 12 years, and we go back 8 years from that point, we will be at the current time, and then we add 4 more years to get to the future time.

### 8
So, by using this logic, we can confidently say that Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for the distance between them to decrease to zero.

### 2
First, let's identify the given information:

* Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
* Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour.
* Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

### 3
Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, he will eventually catch up with him.

### 4
The relative speed between Tom and Bob is the difference between their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

### 5
The time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob can be calculated by dividing the initial distance between them by the relative speed.

### 6
So, the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob is 75 miles / 15 miles per hour.

To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to calculate the ages of Steve's wife, son, and son's wife step by step.

### 2
Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him. So, we can calculate his wife's age by adding 4 to Steve's age.

### 3
Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4
Steve's wife's age = 60 + 4
Steve's wife's age = 64

### 4
Their son is currently half as old as his mom. So, we can calculate their son's age by dividing his mom's age by 2.

### 5
Their son's age = Steve's wife's age / 2
Their son's age = 64 / 2
Their son's age = 32

### 6
Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, we can calculate their son's wife's age by subtracting 3 from their son's age.

### 7
Their son's wife's age = Their son's age - 3
Their son's wife's age = 32 - 3
Their son's wife's age = 29

To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we first need to calculate the amount of flour in one bag.

Each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is the product of the number of portions and the weight of each portion.

### 2
We can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions (8) by the weight of each portion (2 kilograms).

### 3
The calculation for the total amount of flour in one bag is as follows:

8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

### 4
Now that we know the amount of flour in one bag, we can find the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3.

### 5
The calculation for the total amount of flour in three bags is as follows:

16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

### 6
Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms.

### 7
To confirm our answer, we can also calculate the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying the number of portions in three bags by the weight of each portion.

### 8
Since each bag has 8 portions, three bags will have 3 * 8 = 24 portions.

### 9
The total amount of flour in three bags is then the product of the number of portions (24) and the weight of each portion (2 kilograms).

### 10
The calculation for the total amount of flour in three bags is as follows:

24 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 48 kilograms

Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. To find the time it takes to dig through 24 feet of soil, we need to divide the total depth of soil by the rate at which he digs through soil.

## 
**Step 2** Calculate the time it takes to dig through clay
Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil. Since he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, he can dig 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour through clay. To find the time it takes to dig through 8 feet of clay, we need to divide the total depth of clay by the rate at which he digs through clay.

## 
**Step 3** Add the time it takes to dig through soil and clay to find the total time
To find the total time it takes to dig the well, we need to add the time it takes to dig through soil and the time it takes to dig through clay.

## 
**Step 4** Perform the calculations for soil
Time to dig through soil = Total depth of soil / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

## 
**Step 5** Perform the calculations for clay
Time to dig through clay = Total depth of clay / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

## 
**Step 6** Add the time it takes to dig through soil and clay
Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes required for his class.

### 2
First, we need to determine the total number of people in Howie's class. This includes Howie himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

### 3
The total number of people in Howie's class is 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people.

### 4
Since Howie wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, we need to multiply the total number of people by 2.

### 5
The total number of cupcakes required is 27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes.

### 6
However, we also need to consider that Howie wants to get the same amount of 2 cupcakes for himself.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost is 20 * 20 = $400.

The total cost of pomegranates on Tuesday is $400.

## 

### Step 2. Calculate the discount Clara got on Tuesday
Clara got $2 off because she had a voucher, so the discount is $2.

## 

### Step 3. Calculate the final cost Clara paid on Tuesday
The final cost Clara paid on Tuesday is the total cost minus the discount, which is $400 - $2 = $398.

## 

### Step 4. Calculate the total cost of pomegranates on Wednesday

### 2. Determine the number of legs for each type of animal
Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.

### 3. Set up the equations based on the given information
We can set up two equations based on the given information:

We can solve the second equation for S: S = 20 - G

### 5. Substitute S into the first equation
Substitute S into the first equation: 4(20 - G) + 2G = 70

### 6. Simplify the equation
Simplify the equation: 80 - 4G + 2G = 70

Roger needs to buy a week's worth of coffee and a donut. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more.

### Step 1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee
The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.

#### 20% of $5 is $1
$1 is 20% of $5.

#### The more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound
The more expensive brand costs $5 per pound plus the additional 20% cost of $1.

### Step 2. Calculate the total cost of a week's worth of coffee
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he needs a week's worth of coffee.

#### A week has 7 days
There are 7 days in a week.

#### Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week.

#### The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound
The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.

#### The more expensive brand of coffee costs $6 per pound
The more expensive brand of coffee costs $6 per pound.

### Step 3. Calculate the total cost of the coffee
Roger can either buy the normal brand of coffee or the more expensive brand of coffee.

#### If Roger buys the normal brand of coffee, the total cost is $5 * 7 = $35
The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, and Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee.

#### If Roger buys the more expensive brand of coffee, the total cost is $6 * 7 = $42
The more expensive brand of coffee costs $6 per pound, and Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee.

### Step 4. Add the cost of the donut to the total cost of the coffee
Roger also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.

#### The total cost of the coffee is $42
The more expensive brand of coffee costs $42.

#### The total cost of the coffee and the donut is $42 + $2 = $44
The cost of the donut is $2, so the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The items and their prices are:
- 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each

To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the amount of flour, sugar, and salt separately.

Each muffin requires:
- 5 tablespoons of flour
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 0.25 tablespoons of salt

### 2
Since Svetlana is making 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 16.

- Flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

### 3
Now, we need to add up the amount of flour, sugar, and salt to find the total amount of dry ingredients needed.

Total dry ingredients = 80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt)

### 4
Perform the addition to find the total amount of dry ingredients.

Adam went to a store to buy some sweets. He bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75. How much change did Adam get, if he paid the cashier $15?

### Step 1. Calculate the total cost of type A candies
The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5. Adam bought 7 candies of type A, so the total cost of type A candies is:
7 * $0.5 = $3.5

There are no candies of type A to calculate now.

### Step 2. Calculate the total cost of type B candies
The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75. Adam bought 10 candies of type B, so the total cost of type B candies is:
10 * $0.75 = $7.5

There are no candies of type B to calculate now.

### Step 3. Calculate the total cost of all candies
The total cost of all candies is the sum of the cost of type A and type B candies:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

There are no candies of type A to calculate now.

### Step 4. Calculate the change Adam got
Adam paid the cashier $15. The total cost of all candies is $11. So, the change Adam got is:
$15 - $11 = $4

Christina records her mood every day on a calendar for thirty days. We need to find out how many good days are left in the month after the first 15 days.

She had twelve good days in total, but we don't know how many are left yet.

#### 2
The first eight days were good, so we subtract these from the total number of good days.

12 (total good days) - 8 (first 8 good days) = 4 good days left

#### 3
The next three days were good, neutral, and good. We need to subtract these from the remaining good days.

4 (remaining good days) - 1 (good day) = 3 good days left

#### 4
However, we still need to consider the remaining days in the month. There are 30 days in total, and we have already accounted for 15 days.

30 (total days) - 15 (days already accounted for) = 15 days left

#### 5
Since we know that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral, we can conclude that the remaining 15 days will follow the same pattern.

#### 6
The pattern of good, bad, and neutral days will repeat for the remaining 15 days.

#### 7
Since the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral, we can conclude that the next 8 days will be good.

#### 8
However, we already accounted for 1 good day in the next 3 days. So, we need to subtract 1 from the next 8 good days.

8 (next 8 good days) - 1 (already accounted for) = 7 good days left

#### 9
Now, we need to add the remaining good days from the first 15 days and the next 8 good days.

3 (remaining good days from the first 15 days) + 7 (next 8 good days) = 10 good days left

#### 10
However, we still need to consider the remaining days in the month. There are 30 days in total, and we have already accounted for 15 days.

30 (total days) - 15 (days already accounted for) = 15 days left

#### 240

**Step 2** Calculate the difference between the target height and the initial height
The target height is 600 inches, and the initial height is 240 inches. We can find the difference by subtracting the initial height from the target height.

#### 360

**Step 3** Calculate the number of days required to reach the target height
We know that the bamboo grows 30 inches a day. To find the number of days required to reach the target height, we can divide the difference between the target height and the initial height by the daily growth rate.

The sisters have collected a total of 20 + 44 = 64 signatures so far.

They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.

### Step 2. Calculate the number of signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal.
To find out how many signatures they need to collect, we subtract the current total from the goal.

### Step 3. Subtract the current total from the goal.
The goal is 100 signatures, and the current total is 64 signatures.

### 2
Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. She works 3 hours per day.

In two days, Karen works:
3 hours/day * 2 days = 6 hours

### 3
Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings for two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works.

Karen's total earnings = $20/hour * 6 hours = $120

689,"**Step 1** Calculate the total cost of the lollipops Manolo bought initially.
Manolo bought 5 lollipops at $0.40 each, so the total cost of lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

 

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the candies Manolo bought initially.
Manolo bought 4 candies at $3.20, so the total cost of candies is $3.20.

 

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the items Manolo bought initially.
The total cost of the items Manolo bought initially is $2.00 (lollipops) + $3.20 (candies) = $5.20.

 

**Step 4** Calculate the cost of one lollipop.
The cost of one lollipop is $0.40.

 

**Step 5** Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops.
The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

 

**Step 6** Calculate the cost of 10 candies.
Since the cost of 4 candies is $3.20, the cost of one candy is $3.20 / 4 = $0.80. Therefore, the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.80 = $8.00.

 

**Step 7** Calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 (10 lollipops) + $8.00 (10 candies) = $12.00.

 

**Step 8** Calculate the total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items.
The total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items is $5.20 (initial items) + $12.00 (additional items) = $17.20.

 

**Step 9** Calculate the cost of the additional candies Manolo bought.
Since Manolo bought 10 candies and he already had 4 candies, he bought 10 - 4 = 6 additional candies. The cost of 6 additional candies is 6 * $0.80 = $4.80.

 

**Step 10** Calculate the total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items.
The total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items is $5.20 (initial items) + $4.80 (additional candies) + $4.00 (10 lollipops) = $14.00.

 

**Step 11** Calculate the total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items.
The total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items is $5.20 (initial items) + $4.00 (10 lollipops) + $8.00 (10 candies) = $17.20.

 

**Step 12** Calculate the total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items.
The total cost of the items Manolo bought initially and the additional items is $17.20.

Rong saves 20 coins in his piggy bank every month.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20 and add it to 20.
2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8.
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of months they have been saving
They have been saving for 10 years, and there are 12 months in a year.
So, the total number of months is 10 * 12 = 120 months.

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved
Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will save 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

**Step 5** Calculate the total number of coins Neil has saved
Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will save 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

**Step 6** Calculate the total number of coins they have saved
To find the total number of coins, we need to add the coins saved by Rong and Neil.
Total coins = 2400 (Rong's coins) + 3360 (Neil's coins) = 5760 coins.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box.

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

There are 300 fireworks in the city.


### 2. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah can see from her house
Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4.

300 * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Hannah can see 120 fireworks from her house.


### 3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard
Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. To find the total number of fireworks, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box.

3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Hannah will set off 15 fireworks in her backyard.


### 4. Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see
To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks she can see from her house and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard.

120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people in the group. This includes Aiden and his friends who are already at the cinema, as well as the additional friends they meet up with.

There are 12 friends who are already at the cinema, and 7 more friends who meet up with them. So, the total number of people in the group is 12 + 7 = 19.

### 2
Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks required for the group. This can be done by multiplying the total number of people by the number of drinks and snacks each seat can hold.

Total number of drinks = 19 * 2 = 38
Total number of snacks = 19 * 3 = 57

### 3
Now that we have the total number of drinks and snacks, we can calculate the total amount spent on them. Since each drink and snack costs $2, we can multiply the total number of drinks and snacks by the cost per item.

Total amount spent on drinks = 38 * $2 = $76
Total amount spent on snacks = 57 * $2 = $114

### 4
To find the overall amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to add the total amount spent on drinks and snacks.

Total amount spent = $76 + $114 = $190

### 5
However, we need to consider that the question asks for the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, but it does not specify whether the drinks are included in the total. Since the problem states that they buy enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, we can assume that the drinks are also included in the total.

To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine how much Gordy's truck can carry.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which can carry 4,000 pounds.

### 2
We calculate Gordy's truck capacity by adding 800 pounds to Gissela's truck capacity.

Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,800 pounds

### 3
Now that we know Gordy's truck capacity, we can find the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity
Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds
Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 8,800 pounds

### 4
We know that when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

### 5
To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity of all three trucks - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800 pounds

To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we first need to determine the number of dumplings each male ate.

### 2
Since each female ate 3 dumplings, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can calculate the number of dumplings each male ate by adding 1 to the number of dumplings each female ate.

### 3
The number of dumplings each male ate is 3 + 1 = 4.

### 4
Now, we need to find out the total number of dumplings eaten by the females.

### 5
There are 6 females, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18.

### 6
Next, we need to find out the total number of dumplings eaten by the males.

### 7
There are 8 males, and each male ate 4 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32.

### 8
To find out the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to add the total number of dumplings eaten by the females and the males.

### 9
The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 + 32 = 50.

Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the 40% used by the city.

### Step2. Calculate the actual percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes
To find the actual percentage used for industrial purposes, we multiply 40% by 80%:
40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

### Step3. Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes
Since 32% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage is used for non-industrial purposes. To find this, we subtract the industrial percentage from the total percentage used by the city:
40% - 32% = 8%

### Step4. Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes
Since 8% of the water used by Colorado City is for non-industrial purposes, and this is 8% of the 40% used by the city, we need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. To find this, we multiply 8% by 100% (to convert it to a percentage of the total river's water):

We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches. To make calculations easier, we will convert this length into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet into inches as follows:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Adding the 4 inches to this, we get:

96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

### 2
We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, the length of one of Topher's shoes can be represented as 9x + 10.

### 3
Since we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, we can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

9x + 10 = 100

### 4
To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

### 5
Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

### 6
Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

### 7
We have found the length of one of Bobby's shoes, which is 10 inches.

### 8
We can verify our answer by plugging the value of 'x' back into the original equation:

9x + 10 = 9(10) + 10
= 90 + 10
= 100

This confirms that our answer is correct.

### 9
We have successfully solved for the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

### 10
Our final answer is the length of one of Bobby's shoes, which is 10 inches.

To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we first need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately.

### 2
First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with four windows each. Since Hannah smashed a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find a quarter of 64.

### 3
To find a quarter of 64, we can multiply 64 by 1/4 or 0.25. This will give us the number of students' cars' windows smashed.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with two windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32.

### 5
To find 3/4ths of 32, we can multiply 32 by 3/4 or 0.75. This will give us the number of teachers' cars' windows smashed.

### 6
Now that we have the number of windows smashed from both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, we can add these two numbers together to find the total number of windows smashed.

### 7
Let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars. We multiply 64 by 0.25 to get 16.

### 8
Now, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars. We multiply 32 by 0.75 to get 24.

### 9
Finally, we add the number of windows smashed from the students' cars (16) and the teachers' cars (24) to get the total number of windows smashed.

There are two types of blue spools: light blue and dark blue. We need to add these two numbers together to get the total number of blue spools.

There are 15 light blue spools and 45 dark blue spools, so the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

### 2. Calculate the total number of spools of thread
We need to add up the number of spools of each color to get the total number of spools.

There are 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools, so the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

### 3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools
To calculate the percentage of blue spools, we need to divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

The total number of blue spools is 60 and the total number of spools is 150, so the percentage of blue spools is (60 / 150) * 100 = 40.

### 4. Convert the percentage to a decimal

To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

He chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

### 2
Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we need to divide the total number of pieces Parker will chew by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need.

### 3
To do this, we will divide 120 (total pieces) by 15 (pieces per pack).

### 4
Performing the division, we get:
120 / 15 = 8

### 5
This means that Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

### 6
However, we need to consider if there will be any leftover gum after 30 days.

### 7
Since 8 packs will give him a total of 8 * 15 = 120 pieces, which is exactly the number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, there will be no leftover gum.

### 8
Therefore, Parker will need exactly 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

### 9
We can also verify this by checking if 7 packs would be enough.

### 10
7 packs would give him a total of 7 * 15 = 105 pieces, which is less than the 120 pieces he will chew in 30 days.

To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the initial number of birds.

The initial number of birds is 12.

### 2
To find 1/3 of 12, we can divide 12 by 3.

12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away.

### 3
Now, we need to find the number of birds that are left in the backyard.

Initial number of birds = 12
Number of birds scared away = 4

Number of birds left = Initial number of birds - Number of birds scared away
= 12 - 4
= 8

### 4
A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds.

Number of birds that joined = 20

### 5
Now, we need to find the total number of birds in the backyard.

Number of birds left = 8
Number of birds that joined = 20

Total number of birds = Number of birds left + Number of birds that joined
= 8 + 20
= 28

### 6
So, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28.

### 7
We can also verify our answer by adding the number of birds that were initially present, the number of birds that were scared away, and the number of birds that joined.

Initial number of birds = 12
Number of birds scared away = 4
Number of birds that joined = 20

Total number of birds = Initial number of birds + Number of birds scared away + Number of birds that joined
= 12 + 4 + 20
= 36

However, this is incorrect. We already calculated that the total number of birds is 28.

### 8
The reason for the discrepancy is that the number of birds that were scared away is not the same as the number of birds that were initially present minus the total number of birds.

Number of birds that were initially present = 12
Number of birds that were scared away = 1/3 of 12
= 4

Total number of birds = 12 - 4 + 20
= 28

### 9
So, the correct total number of birds in the backyard is indeed 28.

### 10
We can also verify our answer by using a different method.

Initial number of birds = 12
Number of birds scared away = 1/3 of 12
= 4

Number of birds left = Initial number of birds - Number of birds scared away
= 12 - 4
= 8

Number of birds that joined = 20

744,"**Step 1** Calculate the total number of animals that need grooming
===========================================================

Melissa has 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses that need grooming. To find the total number of animals, we add these numbers together.

8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28 animals


**Step 2** Calculate the number of days in the week
=============================================

There are 7 days in a week.


**Step 3** Calculate the number of animals to groom per day
=====================================================

To find the number of animals to groom per day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in the week.

28 (total animals) / 7 (days in the week) = 4 animals per day


**Step 4** Consider the grooming tasks separately
=============================================

However, we need to consider the grooming tasks separately, as they may require different amounts of time or effort.


**Step 5** Calculate the number of dogs to bathe per day
================================================

Melissa has 8 dogs to bathe. To find the number of dogs to bathe per day, we divide the total number of dogs by the number of days in the week.

8 (dogs) / 7 (days in the week) = 1.14 dogs per day


**Step 6** Calculate the number of cats to clip nails per day
=====================================================

Melissa has 5 cats to clip nails. To find the number of cats to clip nails per day, we divide the total number of cats by the number of days in the week.

5 (cats) / 7 (days in the week) = 0.71 cats per day


**Step 7** Calculate the number of birds to trim wings per day
=====================================================

Melissa has 3 birds to trim wings. To find the number of birds to trim wings per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days in the week.

3 (birds) / 7 (days in the week) = 0.43 birds per day


**Step 8** Calculate the number of horses to brush per day
================================================

Melissa has 12 horses to brush. To find the number of horses to brush per day, we divide the total number of horses by the number of days in the week.

12 (horses) / 7 (days in the week) = 1.71 horses per day


**Step 9** Consider the total number of animals to groom per day
===========================================================

Since we cannot groom a fraction of an animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number for each type of animal. However, we can still calculate the total number of animals to groom per day by adding the rounded numbers.

Rounded numbers:
- Dogs: 2
- Cats: 1
- Birds: 1
- Horses: 2

Total animals to groom per day: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 animals per day


**Step 10** Final calculation
==========================

However, we initially calculated that 4 animals per day would be the result of dividing the total number of animals by the number of days in the week. We should consider that the initial calculation was correct, and the subsequent steps were to break down the tasks. Therefore, the final result is the initial calculation.

We need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined.

### Step 1. Determine the number of marbles Sean has
Sean has 56 marbles.

### Step 2. Calculate the number of marbles Cal has
Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean.
Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

### Step 3. Calculate the number of marbles Carl has
Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

### Step 4. Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined
Total marbles = marbles Carl has + marbles Cal has
Total marbles = 224 + 112

To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the size of each group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

### 2
We will divide 54 by 6 to find the size of each group.

54 ÷ 6 = 9

### 3
Now that we know the size of each group is 9, we can find out how many groups are needed in total for 54 students. Since each group has 9 students, we can divide the total number of students by the size of each group.

### 4
We will divide 54 by 9 to find the total number of groups needed.

54 ÷ 9 = 6

### 5
However, the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we will subtract the total number of groups needed from the required number of groups.

### 6
We will subtract 6 from 12 to find the number of additional groups needed.

12 - 6 = 6

### 7
Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can conclude that 6 more groups are needed to form.

### 8
However, we need to check if the total number of students can be evenly divided into 12 groups of equal size.

### 9
We will divide 54 by 12 to find the size of each group.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

### 10
Since the size of each group is not a whole number, we cannot divide the students evenly into 12 groups. Therefore, our initial conclusion that 6 more groups are needed still stands.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. 
To find 90% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.9.
30 * 0.9 = 27

### Step 

Lorraine trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. This means she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

### Step 2. Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading small stickers
Since each small sticker is worth one large button, Lorraine gets 27 large buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

### Step 3. Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers
Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
To find 50% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.5.
40 * 0.5 = 20

### Step 

Lorraine trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. This means she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

### Step 4. Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers
Since each large sticker is worth one large button, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

### Step 5. Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers
Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large button is worth three small stickers, we multiply 20 by 3.
20 * 3 = 60

### Step 6. Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has
Lorraine has 27 large buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
To find the total number of buttons, we add these numbers together.
27 + 20 + 60 = 107

### Step 7. Add the large buttons to the total number of buttons
Since each large button is worth three small buttons, we need to convert the large buttons to small buttons.
We multiply 27 large buttons by 3.
27 * 3 = 81
We multiply 20 large buttons by 3.
20 * 3 = 60
We add these numbers to the total number of buttons.
107 + 81 + 60 = 248

### Step 8. Add the small buttons to the total number of buttons
We already calculated the total number of buttons in the previous step.
The total number of buttons is 248.

### Step 9. Add the large buttons to the total number of buttons
We already calculated the total number of buttons in the previous step.
The total number of buttons is 248.

To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to understand the given information about the Pomeranian girls.

### 2
We are told that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means that the total number of Pomeranians can be calculated by multiplying the number of girls by 3.

### 3
So, the total number of Pomeranians is 6 * 3 = 18.

### 4
Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. This means that the total number of puppies can be calculated by dividing the total number of Pomeranians by 2/3.

### 5
To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. So, we multiply 18 by 3/2.

### 6
18 * 3/2 = 18 * 3 / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27.

### 7
Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

### 8
We can verify this by checking if two thirds of 27 is indeed 18 (the number of Pomeranians). 

### 9
Two thirds of 27 is (2/3) * 27 = 18, which matches the given information.

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x.

### 2
Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

### 3
The third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2).

### 4
We can simplify the expression for the third house: 2 * (x/2) = x.

### 5
The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of lettuce heads by the price per lettuce head.

Chase's total cost = 1 * $3 = $3


**Step 4** Add up the total costs of all three to find the total amount spent
To find the total amount spent, we add up the total costs of cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce.

Total amount spent = Leila's total cost + Jack's total cost + Chase's total cost
Total amount spent = $6 + $5 + $3
Total amount spent = $14

To find out how many books Ahmed has read, we need to determine how many books Ezra read in the first hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can represent the number of books Ahmed read as x. This means Ezra read 2x books in the first hour.

We know that Ezra read 300 books in the first hour. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x = 300 to find the value of x.

### 2
To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.

2x / 2 = 300 / 2

x = 150

### 3
Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books in the first hour, we can find out how many books he read in total. Ahmed read 150 more books in the second hour.

### 4
Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, we need to add this to the 300 books he already read.

### 5
Now, let's calculate the total number of books read by both Ahmed and Ezra.

Ahmed read 150 + 150 = 300 books.
Ezra read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

### 6
To find the total number of books read by both Ahmed and Ezra, we need to add the number of books each of them read.

Total books read = 300 (Ahmed) + 450 (Ezra) = 750

### 7
Therefore, the total number of books read by both Ahmed and Ezra is 750.

### 8
We can also calculate the total number of books read by adding the number of books each of them read in the first hour and the second hour.

Total books read = (150 + 300) (Ahmed) + (300 + 150) (Ezra) = 750

### 9
This confirms that the total number of books read by both Ahmed and Ezra is indeed 750.

### 10
So, the total number of books read by both Ahmed and Ezra is 750.

To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we first need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

Each of the 4 vanilla scents sold 5 units, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
- 4 (vanilla scents) * 5 (units sold per scent) = 20

Each of the 8 fruity scents sold 2 units, so the total number of fruity scents sold is:
- 8 (fruity scents) * 2 (units sold per scent) = 16

### 2
Now that we have the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, we can find the difference between the two numbers.

To do this, we subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- 20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4

* They receive 5 points for each berry they collect.
* They receive 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

### Step 2. Define the differences in their gameplay
* Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
* Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
* Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on usual days. They ride thrice a day for 5 days, so the total number of times they ride on usual days is:

* 3 times/day * 5 days = 15 times

### 3
Now, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the two other days when they ride twice the times they do on usual days. They ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times/day.

### 4
So, on these two days, they ride 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

### 5
Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the two special days to get the total number of times they ride in a week.

### 6
Total number of times on usual days: 15 times
Total number of times on special days: 12 times
Total number of times in a week: 15 + 12 = 27 times

### 7
However, we need to consider that they ride twice on two days, so we need to add the extra rides on these two days.

Extra rides on special days: 2 * 12 = 24 times

We need to calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week based on its fuel efficiency, the price of gas, and the distance he travels to work.

### Step 1. Calculate the daily distance traveled
The distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he travels to work from Monday to Friday. So, the total daily distance traveled is:
5 miles (one-way) * 2 (to and from work) = 10 miles/day

### Step 2. Calculate the weekly distance traveled
Since Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance traveled is:
10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

### Step 3. Calculate the weekly fuel consumption
Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, and he travels 50 miles/week. To find out how much fuel he consumes per week, we divide the total distance traveled by the fuel efficiency:
50 miles/week ÷ 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

### Step 4. Calculate the weekly fuel cost
The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, and Andy consumes 5 gallons/week. To find out how much money his car is consuming per week, we multiply the fuel consumption by the price of gas:
5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

We need to find out how many OLED TVs Samwell was able to sell this week.

### Step 1. Calculate the total fraction of smart TVs and analog TVs sold
One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, which can be represented as 1/4. One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, which can be represented as 1/8.

### 

### Step 2. Add the fractions of smart TVs and analog TVs to find the total fraction of non-OLED TVs sold
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. We can convert 1/4 to 2/8 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2.

### 
1/4 = 2/8
1/8 = 1/8
Total fraction of non-OLED TVs = 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8

### 

### Step 3. Calculate the fraction of OLED TVs sold
Since the total fraction of all TVs sold is 1 (or 8/8), we can subtract the fraction of non-OLED TVs from 1 to find the fraction of OLED TVs sold.

Fraction of OLED TVs = 1 - 3/8
To subtract 3/8 from 1, we can convert 1 to 8/8.
Fraction of OLED TVs = 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8

### 

### Step 4. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold
We know that the total number of TVs sold is 40. We can multiply the fraction of OLED TVs by the total number of TVs to find the number of OLED TVs sold.

### 
Number of OLED TVs = (Fraction of OLED TVs) * Total number of TVs
= (5/8) * 40
= (5 * 40) / 8
= 200 / 8

### 3
To find the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"", we multiply the time per song by the number of times it's sung: 150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds.

### 4
Next, we need to calculate the time spent singing ""Jingle Bells"". The choir plans to sing it once, and it's 240 seconds long.

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4
- Total: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14


### 3
Now that we know the total number of stuffed animals, we can calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals.

We will use the formula: (30/100) * Total number of stuffed animals = Number of stuffed goats needed


### 4
We plug in the numbers into the formula: (30/100) * 14 = 4.2


### 5
Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the percentage of stuffed goats is at least 30%.


### 6
We round up 4.2 to the nearest whole number, which is 5.


### 7
Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals.


### 8
We can verify our answer by calculating the new total number of stuffed animals and checking if the percentage of stuffed goats is indeed 30%.

New total number of stuffed animals: 14 (original) + 5 (new goats) = 19


### 9
We calculate the percentage of stuffed goats: (5/19) * 100 = 26.32% (approximately)

Felix made $105 during the week.

### 2. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed
Since Felix charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches by dividing the total amount of money made by the cost per branch.
Total number of branches = Total amount of money made / Cost per branch
Total number of branches = $105 / $0.25

### 3. Perform the division to find the total number of branches
Total number of branches = 420

### 4. Determine the number of days in a week
There are 7 days in a week.

### 5. Calculate the average number of branches Felix climbed per day
To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week.
Average number of branches per day = Total number of branches / Number of days in a week
Average number of branches per day = 420 / 7

### 6. Perform the division to find the average number of branches per day
Average number of branches per day = 60

**Step 2** Calculate the time played by Jack
Jack can play for 20 minutes.

## 

**Step 3** Calculate the time played by the two worse friends
The two worse friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes each.

## 

**Step 4** Calculate the time played by the better friend
The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

## 

**Step 5** Calculate the total time played by all friends
The total time played by all friends is 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes.

## 

**Step 6** Calculate the time wasted
The time wasted is the difference between the total time played and the total time available, which is 240 - 70 = 170 minutes.

## 

**Step 7** Calculate the number of quarters used for the wasted time
Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the number of quarters used for the wasted time is 170 / 20 = 8.5.

## 

**Step 8** Calculate the total number of quarters used
Since Jack plays for 20 minutes, the total number of quarters used is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8.5 = 12.5.

The problem states that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. This can be represented as:
- F = Z
- S = G

### 2. It is also given that Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest.

This can be represented as:
- O = 2S
- S = 2Z

### 3. Since S = 2Z, we can substitute S in the equation O = 2S to get O in terms of Z.

This gives us:
- O = 2(2Z)
- O = 4Z

### 4. We know that the total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces.

Since the jar is filled with the ingredients, the total amount of ingredients is equal to the sum of the individual ingredients. This can be represented as:
- Z + F + S + G + O = 10

### 5. We can substitute F = Z, S = G, and O = 4Z into the equation from step 4.

This gives us:
- Z + Z + G + G + 4Z = 10

### 6. Simplify the equation from step 5 by combining like terms.

This gives us:
- 6Z + 2G = 10

### 7. Since S = G, we can substitute S for G in the equation from step 6.

This gives us:
- 6Z + 2S = 10

### 8. We can substitute S = 2Z into the equation from step 7.

This gives us:
- 6Z + 2(2Z) = 10

### 9. Simplify the equation from step 8 by combining like terms.

This gives us:
- 6Z + 4Z = 10
- 10Z = 10

### 10. Solve for Z by dividing both sides of the equation by 10.

This gives us:
- Z = 1

### 11. Now that we know Z, we can find O by substituting Z into the equation O = 4Z.

This gives us:

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes he already has.

He has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.

### 2
We add the number of chocolate cupcakes and toffee cupcakes to find the total number of cupcakes Paul already has.

Total cupcakes = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes

### 3
Now, we need to find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy to reach the total of 63 cupcakes.

### 4
To do this, we subtract the total number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Number of cupcakes to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Total cupcakes already have

### 5
Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes to have a total of 63 cupcakes for the birthday party.

### 6
Since Paul already has some cupcakes, we don't need to buy any additional chocolate or toffee cupcakes.

Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day.

### 2
She also walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day. 
This means she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

### 3
To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to add the time she walked on the first day and the time she walked on the second day.
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

### 4
Since we need to calculate the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.

### 5
To convert 12 hours to minutes, we multiply 12 by 60.
12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

### 6
Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

### 7
We can also verify this by adding the time she walked on the first day in minutes and the time she walked on the second day in minutes.
Time on the first day in minutes = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
Time on the second day in minutes = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.
Total time in minutes = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week.

* Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week. 
* The total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
* She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs. 
* We need to convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.
* She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. 
* The total time spent doing makeup is 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes.

### 3
Now, let's add up the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week.

* Time spent recording videos: 72 minutes
* Time spent writing songs: 120 minutes
* Time spent doing makeup: 90 minutes
* Total time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in comparison to Pompei.

### 2
First, let's find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. Since Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

### 3
Next, let's find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain. Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

### 4
Now, let's find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain. Since Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

We need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel across a highway, given that three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to do so.

### Step 1. Understand the relationship between kangaroo speed and turtle speed
The turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos.

### Step 2. Determine the speed of the kangaroos
Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that one kangaroo would take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to do so.

### Step 3. Calculate the speed of the turtles
Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, they would take twice as long to travel the same distance. Therefore, one turtle would take 54 * 2 = 108 hours to travel across the highway.

### Step 4. Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway
Since one turtle takes 108 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles would take 108 / 4 = 27 hours to do so.

### Step 5. Verify the result
We have calculated that four turtles would take 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The price of the new laptop is $600, and it will be reduced by $200 if she trades in her old one. So, the new price will be $600 - $200 = $400.

## 

**Step 2** Calculate the total amount Erika has received from her mom and her part-time job.
Erika's mom gave her $80, and she earned $150 from her part-time job. So, the total amount she received is $80 + $150 = $230.

## 

**Step 3** Calculate the total amount Erika has received in addition to her savings.
Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she already has $50 in her purse. Adding this to the amount she received from her mom and her part-time job, we get $50 + $230 = $280.

## 

**Step 4** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her mom and her part-time job.
Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, and the total amount she received is $280, we subtract $280 from the total amount she needs to buy the laptop after trading in her old one, which is $400. So, $400 - $280 = $120.

## 

**Step 5** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job.
Since Erika's mom gave her $80, we subtract this from the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her mom, which is $120. So, $120 - $80 = $40.

## 

**Step 6** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job.
Since Erika earned $150 from her part-time job, we subtract this from the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job, which is $40. So, $40 - $150 is incorrect, we need to add the $150 to the $40 to get the correct amount before she received the $150.

## 

**Step 7** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job.
Since Erika earned $150 from her part-time job, we add this to the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job, which is $40. So, $40 + $150 = $190.

## 

**Step 8** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her mom.
Since Erika's mom gave her $80, we subtract this from the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her mom, which is $190. So, $190 - $80 = $110.

## 

**Step 9** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job and her mom.
Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she already has $50 in her purse. Adding this to the amount she had in her purse before receiving money from her mom, we get $50 + $110 = $160.

## 

**Step 10** Calculate the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job and her mom.
Since Erika earned $150 from her part-time job, we subtract this from the amount Erika had in her purse before receiving money from her part-time job and her mom, which is $160. So, $160 - $150 = $10.

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total milk production from the current 3 cows is 5 * 3 = 15 liters per day.

 

**Step 2** Determine the additional milk production needed.
The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Since he is already producing 15 liters per day from the current 3 cows, he needs an additional 25 - 15 = 10 liters of milk per day.

 

**Step 3** Calculate the number of cows needed to produce the additional milk.
Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the farmer needs 10 / 5 = 2 cows to produce the additional 10 liters of milk per day.

 

**Step 4** Determine the total number of cows needed.
The farmer already has 3 cows, and he needs 2 more cows to produce the additional milk. So, the total number of cows needed is 3 + 2 = 5 cows.

#### 1. Determine the total number of glue sticks needed
Mr. Jackson wants to give each of the 27 students 2 glue sticks. To find the total number of glue sticks needed, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student will receive.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

#### 2. Determine the number of glue sticks in a pack
The glue sticks come in packs of 8.

#### 3. Calculate the minimum number of packs needed
To find the minimum number of packs needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in a pack.

Minimum packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / Glue sticks per pack = 54 / 8 = 6.75

#### 4. Round up to the nearest whole number
Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

Minimum packs needed = 7

#### 5. Consider the extra glue sticks left over
Since 7 packs will give us 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks, and we only need 54 glue sticks, we will have 2 extra glue sticks left over.

#### 6. Conclusion
Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks, with 2 extra glue sticks left over.

The initial amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

## 
## 

**Step 2** Amount of Water After Heavy Rain
After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. This means the amount of water becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

## 
## 

**Step 3** Amount of Water on the Third Day
On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

* 10 burritos/student
* 50 students
* Total burritos given = 10 * 50 = 500

### 2
Next, we need to add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George to the total number of burritos given to the students.

* Mr. George ate 20 burritos
* Total burritos eaten = 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520

### 3
Now, we need to subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered to find the total number of leftover burritos.

* Total burritos ordered = 600
* Total burritos eaten = 520
* Total leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80

### 2
The rink has 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. This means the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

### 3
The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. This means the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

### 4
We know that the rink has 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. Let's add these numbers together to find the total number of non-yellow cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

### 5
We are given that the rink has 75 cars in total. Since we know the number of non-yellow cars, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of non-yellow cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

### 6
Therefore, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

### 7
To confirm our answer, let's add the number of yellow cars to the number of non-yellow cars: 23 + 52 = 75. This matches the total number of cars given in the problem.

We know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write an equation: A = F - 12.

### 3
We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write another equation: S = A + 25.

### 4
Since we have two equations with two variables (A and S), we can substitute the expression for A from the first equation into the second equation: S = (F - 12) + 25.

### 5
Simplifying the equation, we get: S = F + 13.

### 6
We also know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write the equation: S + A + F = 85.

### 7
Substituting the expressions for A and S from the previous equations into this equation, we get: (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85.

### 8
Simplifying the equation, we get: 3F + 1 = 85.

Total amount earned = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total amount earned = $132


### 4. Verify the calculation
We can verify our calculation by checking if it makes sense. If Ella earns $11 per hour, then after 12 hours, she should earn a total of $132, which is consistent with our calculation.

875,"### 1. Calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving 28 marbles from his friend.
Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles. To find the total number of marbles Paul has now, we add these two numbers together.

52 + 28 = 80

There are 80 marbles in total now.

### 2. Determine the number of marbles Paul lost.
Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or 0.25.

80 * 0.25 = 20

Paul lost 20 marbles.

### 3. Calculate the number of marbles Paul has left.
To find the number of marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had.

80 - 20 = 60

Paul has 60 marbles left.

### 4. Verify the calculation.
We can verify our calculation by checking if the number of marbles Paul has left is reasonable. Since Paul initially had 52 marbles and received 28 more, he should have at least 80 marbles. Losing 1/4 of his marbles would be a significant loss, but it's still within the realm of possibility.

To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses.

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can start by finding out how many glasses the boys sold in total.

### 2
The total number of glasses sold by the boys is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

880,"**Step 1** Calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah sells to her friend.
She sells the rope for $2 a meter and the rope is 20 meters long.

The cost of the rope is calculated as follows:
- Cost = Price per meter * Total meters
- Cost = $2 * 20
- Cost = $40

There is a double line break here.

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the new rope Sarah buys.
The new rope costs $1.5 a meter and she wants to buy a rope of the same length, 20 meters.

The cost of the new rope is calculated as follows:
- Cost = Price per meter * Total meters
- Cost = $1.5 * 20
- Cost = $30

There is a double line break here.

**Step 3** Calculate the profit Sarah makes from selling the old rope.
Profit is the difference between the cost of the old rope and the cost of the new rope.

Profit = Cost of old rope - Cost of new rope
Profit = $40 - $30
Profit = $10

There is a double line break here.

**Step 4** Determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.
To find out how much money Sarah will have left over, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit.

Money left over = Profit - Cost of new rope
Money left over = $10 - $30
Money left over = -$20

However, since we cannot have a negative amount of money left over, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

**Step 5** Re-evaluate the problem to find the correct answer.
Since Sarah cannot have a negative amount of money left over, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume Sarah wants to buy a rope that is 20 meters long, but she doesn't have enough money to buy it. In this case, she will not have any money left over.

However, if we assume that Sarah wants to buy a rope that is shorter than 20 meters, we can calculate the amount of money she will have left over.

Let's assume Sarah wants to buy a rope that is x meters long. The cost of the new rope will be $1.5x.

The profit Sarah makes from selling the old rope is $10.

The amount of money Sarah will have left over is the profit minus the cost of the new rope.

Money left over = Profit - Cost of new rope
Money left over = $10 - $1.5x

To find the correct answer, we need to find the value of x that makes the amount of money left over greater than or equal to 0.

**Step 6** Find the value of x that makes the amount of money left over greater than or equal to 0.
To find the value of x, we need to set up an inequality and solve for x.

Money left over ≥ 0
$10 - $1.5x ≥ 0
$1.5x ≤ $10
x ≤ $10 / $1.5
x ≤ 6.67

Since x must be an integer (you can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope), the maximum value of x is 6.

**Step 7** Calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over when she buys a 6-meter rope.
The cost of the new rope is $1.5 * 6 = $9.

The amount of money Sarah will have left over is the profit minus the cost of the new rope.

Money left over = Profit - Cost of new rope
Money left over = $10 - $9
Money left over = $1

The cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

### 

### 2. Calculate the cost of the packets of chicken
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since one pack of bacon costs $2, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.

Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of the packets of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and has a 15-minute encore. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We need to find the runtime of her usual concerts.

### Step 1. Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as x minutes.
We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so its runtime is 2x minutes.

### Step 2. The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore.
So, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the concert itself and the encore, which is 2x + 15 minutes.

### Step 3. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.
Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x + 15 = 65 to represent this information.

### Step 4. Now, let's solve the equation 2x + 15 = 65 for x.
First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to get 2x = 50.

### Step 5. Next, we divide both sides of the equation 2x = 50 by 2 to solve for x.
This gives us x = 25.

To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to understand the relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit.

### 2
A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. This means that if the thingamabob spins at x meters per second, the whatchamacallit spins at 11x meters per second.

### 3
We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Using the information from step 2, we can set up the equation 11x = 121 to find the speed of the thingamabob.

### 4
Solving the equation 11x = 121, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second. This is the speed of the thingamabob.

### 5
A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Since the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, the whirligig spins at 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl, Christian, and then Harry based on the given information about Martin's weight.

### 2
Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.

### 3
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so we add 16 kg to Martin's weight to find Carl's weight.

### 4
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask

### 3. Calculate the material needed for 20 small masks
Now, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by 20 to get the total material needed for 20 small masks.
0.5 yards per small mask * 20 small masks = 10 yards

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of sudoku puzzle and then determine how many bottles of water John drinks in that time.

### 2
First, let's calculate the time taken for a normal sudoku puzzle. We are given that it takes 45 minutes.

### 3
Next, let's calculate the time taken for an extreme sudoku puzzle. We are given that it takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku puzzle, so the time taken is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks in 45 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every half hour, he drinks 1 bottle in 30 minutes. So, in 45 minutes, he drinks 45 / 30 = 1.5 bottles.

### 5
Similarly, let's calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks 1.5 bottles in 45 minutes, he drinks 1.5 * 4 = 6 bottles in 180 minutes.

### 6
Now, we have the number of bottles of water John drinks for both types of sudoku puzzles.

### 7
To find the total number of bottles of water John drinks, we need to add the number of bottles he drinks for each type of sudoku puzzle.

### 8
So, the total number of bottles of water John drinks is 1.5 (for normal sudoku) + 6 (for extreme sudoku) = 7.5 bottles.

### 9
However, we need to consider that John drinks a bottle every half hour, which means he drinks a whole bottle at the end of each half hour.

### 10
Since John drinks a whole bottle at the end of each half hour, we can round up the number of bottles he drinks for the normal sudoku puzzle to 2 bottles.

### 11
Now, let's recalculate the total number of bottles of water John drinks. For the normal sudoku puzzle, he drinks 2 bottles, and for the extreme sudoku puzzle, he drinks 6 bottles.

### 12
So, the total number of bottles of water John drinks is 2 + 6 = 8 bottles.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for a 30 day month, so we need to multiply the miles driven per day by the number of days in the month.

Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven in a month = 3000 miles

### 2. Determine the number of tune-ups needed
Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, so we need to divide the total miles driven in a month by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

Number of tune-ups needed = Total miles driven in a month / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups needed = 3000 miles / 1000 miles
Number of tune-ups needed = 3

### 3. Consider any remaining miles that don't require a full tune-up
Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, any remaining miles that don't add up to 1000 will not require a full tune-up. In this case, Jon has driven 3000 miles, which is a multiple of 1000, so he will need 3 full tune-ups.

### 4. Finalize the number of tune-ups needed
Based on the calculations above, Jon will need 3 tune-ups in a 30 day month.

To find the total hours Bruce works in three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and then add them up.

### 2
First, let's calculate the hours Bruce works on Tuesday.
- Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.

### 3
Next, let's calculate the hours Bruce works on Wednesday.
- He works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours on Wednesday.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the hours Bruce works on Thursday.
- He works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours on Thursday.

### 5
Finally, let's add up the hours Bruce works each day to find the total hours.
- Total hours = hours on Tuesday + hours on Wednesday + hours on Thursday
- Total hours = 5 + 10 + 8

### 6
Now, let's calculate the total hours.
- Total hours = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23

### 7
Therefore, the total hours Bruce works in all these three days is 23.

### 8
We can also verify our answer by adding the hours in a different order.
- Total hours = hours on Wednesday + hours on Thursday + hours on Tuesday
- Total hours = 10 + 8 + 5
- Total hours = 23

### 9
Both ways of adding the hours give us the same result, which is 23.

916,"### Problem Explanation
Julia and Nadine's mother gave them the same amount of allowance. They combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream. We need to find out how much allowance each girl received.

### Step 1. Calculate the total cost of the balloons
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is unknown, but we know that 2 balloons cost $0.5. We can use this information to find the cost of 1 balloon and then the cost of 1 dozen balloons.

### Step 2. Find the cost of 1 balloon
Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can divide $0.5 by 2 to find the cost of 1 balloon.
$0.5 ÷ 2 = $0.25 per balloon

### Step 3. Find the cost of 1 dozen balloons
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply the cost of 1 balloon by 12 to find the cost of 1 dozen balloons.
$0.25 per balloon × 12 balloons = $3 per dozen balloons

### Step 4. Calculate the total cost of the cake and balloons
The cake costs $11 and the balloons cost $3. We can add these two costs together to find the total cost.
$11 + $3 = $14

### Step 5. Calculate the remaining money after buying the cake and balloons
The total cost of the cake and balloons is $14. We know that the remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. We can set up an equation to represent this situation.
Let x be the total allowance given to each girl.
x - $14 = 2 × $7

### Step 6. Solve the equation to find the total allowance
We can simplify the equation by multiplying 2 and $7.
x - $14 = $14
Now we can add $14 to both sides of the equation to solve for x.
x = $14 + $14
x = $28

### Step 7. Find the allowance given to each girl
Since Julia and Nadine's mother gave them the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total allowance by 2 to find the allowance given to each girl.
$28 ÷ 2 = $14

To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total revenue per student is:
10 lollipops * $0.8 per lollipop = $8 per student

### 2
Since there are 30 students in the class, the total revenue for the class is:
$8 per student * 30 students = $240

### 3
The total cost for the class is the cost of buying the lollipops for $0.5 each, multiplied by the total number of lollipops sold.
Each student sold 10 lollipops, so the total number of lollipops sold is:
10 lollipops per student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

### 4
The total cost for the class is:
300 lollipops * $0.5 per lollipop = $150

### 5
To find the total profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Total revenue - Total cost = Total profit
$240 - $150 = $90

### 6
Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

### 7
To verify our answer, we can also calculate the profit per student and multiply it by the number of students.
Profit per student = (Revenue per student - Cost per student) * Number of lollipops sold per student
= ($8 - $0.5) * 10
= $7.5 * 10

To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

### 2
Larry has 3 cats.

### 3
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so the number of dogs is 3 * 3 = 9.

### 4
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7.

### 5
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is 3 * 7 = 21.

### 6
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so the number of gerbils is 21 / 3 = 7.

### 7
Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet: cats (3) + dogs (9) + rabbits (7) + fish (21) + gerbils (7).

### 8
3 + 9 = 12
12 + 7 = 19
19 + 21 = 40
40 + 7 = 47

### 9
Therefore, Larry has a total of 47 pets.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

#### 2

Abby can eat 2 slices a day.

Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.

#### 3

The total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

#### 4

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat per day.

#### 5

The total number of slices is 24.

The total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat per day is 6.

#### 6

To find the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we divide 24 by 6.

#### 7

24 / 6 = 4.

#### 8

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

#### 9

This is because Abby and Josh can eat a total of 6 slices per day, and there are 24 slices in the loaf of bread.

Lana has 27 cups in total and uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea. To find out how many cups are used for chamomile and mint tea, we subtract the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups.

There are 27 - 15 = 12 cups used for chamomile and mint tea.

### 2. Determine the total number of rows
Lana divides the cups into 3 rows.

### 3. Calculate the total number of cups in each row
Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, we divide the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea by the number of rows.

12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups per row

### 4. Calculate the number of mint tea cups in each row
Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we divide the number of cups in each row by 2.

4 cups / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea per row

### 5. Confirm the result
We have confirmed that Lana has 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

=====================================================================

The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

**Step 3** Calculate the number of berries the sloth needs to pick per trip
================================================================

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to get the number of berries per trip.

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

However, this is not the least number of berries he can pick up per trip. We need to consider that the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip.

To find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

* The pool contains 10000 gallons of water.
* Half of 10000 gallons is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

### 2
Now that we know the initial amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate how much water will be used in 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.

* In 1 day, 500 gallons of water will be used.
* In 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons of water will be used.

### 3
To find out how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

* Initial amount of water in the tank: 5000 gallons.
* Amount of water used in 6 days: 3000 gallons.
* Remaining water in the tank: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

926,"### Problem Explanation
Colby has $150 to spend at the movies. He wants to know how many movies he can see on a Friday night, given that he has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month.

### Step 1. Calculate the total amount spent on movies so far
Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and each ticket costs $10. So, the total amount spent on these movies is 5 * $10 = $50.
He has also seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the total amount spent on these movies is 8 * $7 = $56.
The total amount spent on movies so far is $50 + $56 = $106.

### Step 2. Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn so far
Colby has already had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the total amount spent on popcorn so far is 2 * $8 = $16.

### Step 3. Calculate the total amount spent on candy so far
Colby has already had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the total amount spent on candy so far is 4 * $2 = $8.

### Step 4. Calculate the remaining amount Colby has to spend
Colby started with $150 and has spent $106 on movies, $16 on popcorn, and $8 on candy. So, the remaining amount he has to spend is $150 - $106 - $16 - $8 = $20.

### Step 5. Calculate the cost of a movie ticket on a Friday night
A movie ticket on a Friday night costs $10.

### Step 6. Calculate the cost of popcorn and candy on a Friday night
A tub of popcorn costs $8 and a box of candy costs $2.

### Step 7. Calculate the remaining amount Colby has to spend after buying popcorn and candy on a Friday night
Colby wants to buy popcorn and candy on a Friday night, which costs $8 + $2 = $10. After buying these, he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left.

### Step 8. Calculate the number of movies Colby can see on a Friday night
Colby has $10 left to spend, and each movie ticket costs $10. So, he can see 1 movie on a Friday night.

### Step 9. Calculate the total number of movies Colby can see
Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, and 1 more movie on a Friday night. So, the total number of movies he can see is 5 + 8 + 1 = 14.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by a vehicle can be calculated by multiplying its speed by the time it traveled.

### 2
First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled.

- The speed of the bus is 60 miles per hour.
- The time the bus traveled is 5 hours.
- To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: distance = speed * time = 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

### 3
Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled.

- The speed of the car is 30 miles per hour.
- The time the car traveled is 8 hours.
- To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time: distance = speed * time = 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

### 4
Now that we have the distances traveled by both the bus and the car, we can find out how much farther the bus went than the car.

- To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

### 5
Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

### 2
Since the hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay, Cameron will pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.

### 3
After the 12-hour mark, Cameron will add 70 pesos for every additional hour. To find out how many additional hours he will pay for, we subtract the 12-hour mark from his total stay: 17 hours - 12 hours = 5 hours.

### 4
Since Cameron will pay 70 pesos for every additional hour, we multiply the number of additional hours by the hourly rate: 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

### 5
To find out the total amount Cameron will pay, we add the initial 12-hour charge to the additional hours charge: 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

### 6
The hotel also offers a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos. To find out how much Cameron would have paid if he chose the 24-hour option, we don't need to calculate anything because it is already given.

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we subtract the amount he paid from the amount he would have paid if he chose the 24-hour option: 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the parts cost and the visit charge.

### 2
The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours and the hourly rate is $35.

### 3
We multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour to get the labor cost.

### 4
The labor cost is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.

### 5
Next, we add the labor cost to the parts cost. The parts cost is $60.

### 6
We add $78.75 (labor cost) to $60 (parts cost) to get the total cost of labor and parts.

### 7
The total cost of labor and parts is $78.75 + $60 = $138.75.

### 8
Finally, we add the visit charge to the total cost of labor and parts. The visit charge is $40.

### 9
We add $138.75 (total cost of labor and parts) to $40 (visit charge) to get the total amount Patty charged.

To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs he bought, the amount he got back from selling the CDs he didn't like, and then subtract the amount he got back from the total cost.

### 2
First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs James bought. Each CD costs $15, and he bought 10 CDs.

### 3
The total cost of the CDs is calculated by multiplying the cost of one CD by the number of CDs: $15 * 10 = $150.

### 4
However, James got a 40% discount on the CDs. To find the amount he paid, we need to calculate 40% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost.

### 5
40% of $150 is calculated by multiplying $150 by 0.4: $150 * 0.4 = $60.

### 6
Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the amount James paid: $150 - $60 = $90.

### 7
Next, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. To find the total amount he got back, we multiply the number of CDs he sold by the price he sold them for: 5 * $40 = $200.

### 8
However, James bought the CDs for $90, and he got back $200 from selling the CDs. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he got back from the amount he paid.

### 9
The amount James was out is calculated by subtracting the amount he got back from the amount he paid: $90 - $200 = -$110.

### 10
Since James was out a negative amount, it means he actually made money from selling the CDs he didn't like.

Total earnings from yams = 6 * $1.5
Total earnings from yams = $9


**Step 2** Calculate the total earnings from selling sweet potatoes
Jen has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each. To find the total earnings from selling sweet potatoes, we multiply the number of sweet potatoes by the price per sweet potato.

Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 * $2
Total earnings from sweet potatoes = $20


**Step 3** Calculate the total earnings from selling carrots
Jen has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each. To find the total earnings from selling carrots, we multiply the number of carrots by the price per carrot.

Total earnings from carrots = 4 * $1.25
Total earnings from carrots = $5


**Step 4** Calculate the total earnings from selling all the root crops
To find the total earnings from selling all the root crops, we add the total earnings from selling yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots.

Total earnings = Total earnings from yams + Total earnings from sweet potatoes + Total earnings from carrots

945,"### Step 1. Calculate the total time James would take to swim across the lake at his normal pace
James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour and needs to cover a distance of 20 miles. 

To find the total time, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 20 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 10 hours

### Step 2. Calculate the distance James swims before stopping on the island
James swims 60% of the total distance of 20 miles.

Distance = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance = 12 miles

### Step 3. Calculate the time James takes to swim the first 12 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

### Step 4. Calculate the time James rests on the island
James rests for half as long as the swimming time.

Rest time = 6 hours / 2
Rest time = 3 hours

### Step 5. Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

### Step 6. Calculate the new speed James swims at after resting
James swims at half the speed of his normal pace.

New speed = 2 miles per hour / 2
New speed = 1 mile per hour

### Step 7. Calculate the time James takes to swim the remaining 8 miles
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

### Step 8. Calculate the total time James takes to get across the lake
Total time = Time to swim first 12 miles + Rest time + Time to swim remaining 8 miles
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

### Step 9. Conclusion
The total time James takes to get across the lake is 17 hours.

We need to find out how many points Azibo scored.

### Step 1. Define the variables
Let's define the variables for the points scored by each person:
- Bahati's points: B
- Azibo's points: A
- Dinar's points: D

### Step 2. Given information
We know that the total points scored by the team is 45, and Bahati scored the most points.
- B + A + D = 45
- B > A > D

### Step 3. Relationship between Bahati and Azibo's points
Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
- B = A + 20

### Step 4. Relationship between Bahati and Dinar's points
Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.
- B = D + 10

### Step 5. Substitute the relationship between Bahati and Azibo's points into the total points equation
Substitute B = A + 20 into the equation B + A + D = 45.
- (A + 20) + A + D = 45

### Step 6. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms.
- 2A + D + 20 = 45

### Step 7. Substitute the relationship between Bahati and Dinar's points into the simplified equation
Substitute B = D + 10 into the equation 2A + D + 20 = 45.
- 2A + (D + 10) + 20 = 45

### Step 8. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms.
- 2A + D + 30 = 45

### Step 9. Rearrange the equation to isolate D
Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation.
- 2A + D = 15

### Step 10. Rearrange the equation to isolate D
Subtract 2A from both sides of the equation.
- D = 15 - 2A

### Step 11. Substitute the relationship between Bahati and Dinar's points into the equation
Substitute B = D + 10 into the equation D = 15 - 2A.
- D + 10 = 15 - 2A

### Step 12. Substitute the relationship between Bahati and Azibo's points into the equation
Substitute B = A + 20 into the equation D + 10 = 15 - 2A.
- (A + 20) + 10 = 15 - 2A

### Step 13. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms.
- A + 30 = 15 - 2A

### Step 14. Rearrange the equation to isolate A
Add 2A to both sides of the equation.
- 3A + 30 = 15

### Step 15. Rearrange the equation to isolate A
Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation.
- 3A = -15

955,"**Step 1** Calculate the initial number of occupied beds
=====================================================

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied beds, we multiply the total capacity by the fraction occupied.

1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds occupied initially.

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks
==========================================================

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients admitted in 2 weeks.

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks
================================================================

Initially, there were 200 occupied beds. After 2 weeks, 700 more patients were admitted. So, the total number of occupied beds is:

200 + 700 = 900 beds occupied after 2 weeks.

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks
================================================================

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. After 2 weeks, 900 beds are occupied. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

1000 - 900 = 100 beds unoccupied after 2 weeks.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, out of which 7 are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

## 
**Step 2** Calculate the number of emails Robyn sends to her family.
Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to her family. So, the number of emails to her family is (2/3) * 9 = 6.

## 
**Step 3** Calculate the number of emails left after subtracting the family emails.
The number of emails left is 9 - 6 = 3.

##

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

## 
**Step 5** Calculate the total number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend.
Since there are 3 emails left after subtracting the family emails, and one-third of them are to her boyfriend, the total number of emails to her boyfriend is 1.

Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number, but Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number by 20%.

### 2. Identify the correct information
We know that Courtney's count is 48, and Kelly said it was 20% higher than the actual number.

### 3. Convert the percentage to a decimal
To calculate the actual number, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal. 20% is equal to 0.20.

### 4. Set up the equation
Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation: 48 = x + (0.20x)

### 5. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms: 48 = 1.20x

### 6. Solve for x
Divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x: x = 48 / 1.20

### 7. Calculate the value of x
x = 40

### 8. Verify the result
Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can verify that 40 is indeed 20% lower than 48.

### 9. Conclusion
The actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The problem states that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. We need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

### 2
Let's start by calculating the total number of holes dug on the first three days. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day.

### 3
To find the total number of holes dug on the first three days, we add the number of holes dug each day: 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.

### 4
The problem states that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

### 5
However, we need to subtract the 2 holes that the pirates filled in on the third day, so the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40 - 2 = 38 holes.

### 6
Since the pirates dug 31 holes on the first three days, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 38 - 31 = 7 holes.

### 7
Therefore, the pirates dug 7 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

### 8
However, we need to consider that the pirates dug 2 holes on the third day that they filled in, but we already subtracted those holes from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

### 9
So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is indeed 7 holes.

### 10
We can verify this answer by checking if the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is indeed 38. If we add the 7 holes dug on the fourth day to the 31 holes dug on the first three days, we get 31 + 7 = 38 holes.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

**Step 2** We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so we can write the equation:
X = S + 5

**Step 3** We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write the equation:
S = 4A - 13

**Step 4** Now we can substitute the value of S from Step 3 into the equation from Step 2:
X = (4A - 13) + 5
X = 4A - 8

**Step 5** Now we can substitute the values of S and X from Steps 3 and 4 into the equation from Step 1:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

**Step 6** Simplify the equation from Step 5:

The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The bird traveled 300 miles in the southerly direction.

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the distance the bird traveled in the northerly direction
The bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

The bird traveled 36 miles in the northerly direction.

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate the distance the bird traveled in the final southerly direction
The bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.

Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

The bird traveled 110 miles in the final southerly direction.

To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

### 2
Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. 
- 1 dozen = 12 brownies

### 3
At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.
- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies

### 4
When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
- 4 dozen = 48 brownies

### 5
During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
- 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- Total eaten = 12 + 6 = 18 brownies

### 6
Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received.
- Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

### 7
Finally, let's subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received.
- Total brownies left = 66 - 18 = 48 brownies

### 8
Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

To find the total time it takes Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of string and then add them up.

### 2
First, let's calculate the time it takes to string the racquets with synthetic gut. There are 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut, and it takes Andy an average of 15 minutes to string each one.

* Time for synthetic gut racquets = Number of racquets * Time per racquet
* Time for synthetic gut racquets = 3 * 15
* Time for synthetic gut racquets = 45 minutes

### 3
Next, let's calculate the time it takes to string the racquets with polyester string. There are 5 racquets to be strung with polyester string, and it takes Andy an average of 22 minutes to string each one.

* Time for polyester racquets = Number of racquets * Time per racquet
* Time for polyester racquets = 5 * 22
* Time for polyester racquets = 110 minutes

### 4
Now, let's calculate the time it takes to string the racquets with hybrid sets. There are 4 racquets to be strung with hybrid sets, and it takes Andy an average of 18 minutes to string each one.

* Time for hybrid racquets = Number of racquets * Time per racquet
* Time for hybrid racquets = 4 * 18
* Time for hybrid racquets = 72 minutes

### 5
Finally, let's add up the time it takes for each type of string to get the total time.

* Total time = Time for synthetic gut racquets + Time for polyester racquets + Time for hybrid racquets
* Total time = 45 + 110 + 72
* Total time = 227 minutes

### 6
Since there are 12 racquets in total, we can also calculate the average time per racquet and multiply it by the total number of racquets.

* Average time per racquet = (Time for synthetic gut racquets + Time for polyester racquets + Time for hybrid racquets) / Total number of racquets
* Average time per racquet = (45 + 110 + 72) / 12
* Average time per racquet = 227 / 12
* Average time per racquet = 18.92 minutes

* Total time = Average time per racquet * Total number of racquets
* Total time = 18.92 * 12
* Total time = 227 minutes

### 7
Both methods give us the same result, which is 227 minutes.

### 8
To convert the total time to hours, we can divide by 60.

* Total time in hours = Total time / 60
* Total time in hours = 227 / 60
* Total time in hours = 3.78 hours

### 9
However, the problem asks for the total time in minutes, so we don't need to convert it to hours.

### 10
Therefore, the total time it takes Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes.

### 3. Calculate the total cost of the first two phones
The total cost of the first two phones is $600 + $600 = $1200.

### 4. Calculate the total cost of the remaining phones
The total cost of the remaining two phones is $300 + $300 = $600.

971,"### Step 1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

### Step 2. Determine the number of wood slats needed per foot
Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.

### Step 3. Calculate the total number of wood slats needed
To find the total number of wood slats needed, we multiply the perimeter of the garden by the number of wood slats needed per foot.

Total wood slats = Perimeter * wood slats per foot
Total wood slats = 50 * 2
Total wood slats = 100

### Step 4. Consider the corners of the garden
Since the garden is a rectangle, there are four corners where the wood slats will overlap. We need to subtract these overlapping sections to avoid double-counting.

### Step 5. Calculate the number of overlapping sections
Each corner has one overlapping section, and there are four corners in total. Therefore, we need to subtract 4 from the total number of wood slats.

Overlapping sections = 4

### Step 6. Calculate the final number of wood slats needed
To find the final number of wood slats needed, we subtract the overlapping sections from the total number of wood slats.

Final wood slats = Total wood slats - Overlapping sections
Final wood slats = 100 - 4
Final wood slats = 96

### Step 7. Consider the sides of the garden
Since the garden is a rectangle, there are two longer sides and two shorter sides. The longer sides have 15 feet of fencing, and the shorter sides have 10 feet of fencing.

### Step 8. Calculate the number of wood slats for each side
For the longer sides, we need 2 wood slats per foot, and there are 15 feet of fencing. Therefore, we need 15 * 2 = 30 wood slats for each longer side.

For the shorter sides, we need 2 wood slats per foot, and there are 10 feet of fencing. Therefore, we need 10 * 2 = 20 wood slats for each shorter side.

### Step 9. Calculate the total number of wood slats for all sides
We have two longer sides and two shorter sides. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of wood slats for each side by 2 and add them together.

Total wood slats for longer sides = 30 * 2
Total wood slats for longer sides = 60

Total wood slats for shorter sides = 20 * 2
Total wood slats for shorter sides = 40

Total wood slats for all sides = Total wood slats for longer sides + Total wood slats for shorter sides
Total wood slats for all sides = 60 + 40
Total wood slats for all sides = 100

### Step 10. Combine the results
We have two results: the final number of wood slats needed (96) and the total number of wood slats for all sides (100). However, the total number of wood slats for all sides includes the corners, which we need to subtract to avoid double-counting.

Therefore, the final number of wood slats needed is indeed 96.

Let's assume that the number of flowers Pat needs to buy is x. Then, the total length of the flower bed that will be occupied by the flowers and the spaces between them is (1 + 1.5)x.

### 4
We know that the total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. So, we can set up the equation:

(1 + 1.5)x + 17 * 1 = 111

### 5
Simplifying the equation, we get:

(2.5)x + 17 = 111

### 6
Subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation, we get:

(2.5)x = 94

### 7
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2.5, we get:

x = 94 / 2.5
x = 37.6

Since we can't buy a fraction of a flower, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, Pat needs to buy 38 flowers.

### 8
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the flowers. Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

The total cost is the number of flowers Pat needs to buy multiplied by the cost of each flower:

Total cost = 38 * 6
Total cost = 228

### 9
However, we need to add the cost of the 17 flowers Pat already owns to the total cost:

Total cost = 228 + (17 * 6)
Total cost = 228 + 102
Total cost = 330

### 10
Therefore, Pat will spend $330 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels he eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar.


### 2
To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to multiply Edgar's daily pretzel consumption by 1/2.


### 3
Edgar's brother eats 18 * 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day.


### 4
Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7 to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week.


### 5
9 pretzels a day * 7 days a week = 63 pretzels a week.


### 6
Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.


### 7
To confirm our answer, let's review the steps we took to find the solution.


### 8
We started by identifying Edgar's daily pretzel consumption.


### 9
We then determined Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption by multiplying Edgar's daily consumption by 1/2.


### 10
Finally, we multiplied Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption by 7 to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran for 3 hours, so the total decrease in temperature is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the temperature decrease when the air conditioner is running on high.
The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees an hour on high. It ran for 4 hours, so the total decrease in temperature is 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate the total temperature decrease when the air conditioner is running.
The total decrease in temperature is the sum of the decrease when running on low and high, which is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculate the temperature increase when the air conditioner is turned off.
The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was turned off for 2 hours, so the total increase in temperature is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

------------------------

**Step 5** Calculate the final temperature.
The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total decrease in temperature plus the total increase in temperature. However, since we are only asked for the difference from the starting temperature, we can simply subtract the total increase in temperature from the total decrease in temperature. The final temperature difference is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

991,"**Step 1** Let's denote Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time as x.

Let's denote Bill's dad's age when he saw the Comet as y.

We know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, so y = 30.

We also know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

This means that Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3y.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time difference between Bill's two sightings of the Comet is 75 years.

We can set up an equation to represent the time difference between the two sightings:

x + 75 = 3y

We already know that y = 30, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

x + 75 = 3(30)


## 

**Step 2** Simplify the equation:

x + 75 = 90

Subtract 75 from both sides of the equation:

x = 15


## 

**Step 3** Verify the result:

We know that Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

This means that Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 3(30) = 90.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time difference between Bill's two sightings of the Comet is 75 years.

This means that Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time, which is consistent with our result.

We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.


### 2
Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as x. We can set up an equation based on the information given. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.


### 3
We can write the equation as 3.5x + 4.5x = 64, where x is the number of chocolate bars in a box.


### 4
Combine like terms to simplify the equation. 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x


### 5
Now the equation becomes 8x = 64


### 6
To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 8.

1004,"**Step 1** Let's start by defining the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.
We know that Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter as P and for Martha as M.


## 

**Step 2** We can set up equations based on the given information.
Since Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, we can write the equation 4P = 64.
Similarly, since Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, we can write the equation 7M = 56.


## 

**Step 3** Now, let's solve the equations to find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha.
Dividing both sides of the equation 4P = 64 by 4, we get P = 16.
Dividing both sides of the equation 7M = 56 by 7, we get M = 8.


## 

**Step 4** Now that we have the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha, we can find the difference.
The difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha is P - M = 16 - 8 = 8.


## 

**Step 5** Since we are asked to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we can conclude that Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.


## 

**Step 6** To confirm our answer, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars for Peter and Martha using the number of chocolate bars in each box.
For Peter, the total number of chocolate bars is 4P = 4(16) = 64.
For Martha, the total number of chocolate bars is 7M = 7(8) = 56.
This confirms that our answer is correct.


## 

**Step 7** Now that we have confirmed our answer, we can conclude that Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.


## 

**Step 8** To summarize, we have found that Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.


## 

**Step 9** We have also confirmed our answer by calculating the total number of chocolate bars for Peter and Martha.


## 

**Step 10** Therefore, we can confidently say that Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

1005,"**Step 1** Calculate the number of female porcupines in the park.
The total population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

The number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30

There are 30 female porcupines in the park.

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the number of baby porcupines born every month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.

Number of baby porcupines born every month = 30 * 4 = 120

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year, and 120 baby porcupines are born every month.

Total number of baby porcupines born in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.
The initial population of porcupines is 50, and 1440 baby porcupines are born in a year.

Total number of porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

------------------------

**Step 5** Consider the death rate of porcupines.
Since there is no information about the death rate of porcupines, we will assume that the death rate is 0.

------------------------

**Step 6** Calculate the final number of porcupines in the park after a year.
The total number of porcupines after a year is 1490.

The final number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490.

------------------------

**Step 7** Consider the initial number of male porcupines.
The initial number of male porcupines is not given, but we can calculate it using the total population and the number of female porcupines.

Number of male porcupines = Total population - Number of female porcupines
= 50 - 30
= 20

------------------------

**Step 8** Calculate the number of male porcupines after a year.
Since there is no information about the death rate of male porcupines, we will assume that the death rate is 0.

The number of male porcupines after a year is 20.

------------------------

**Step 9** Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.
The total number of porcupines after a year is the sum of the number of male and female porcupines.

Total number of porcupines after a year = Number of male porcupines + Number of female porcupines
= 20 + 30 + 1440
= 1490

------------------------

**Step 10** Calculate the final number of porcupines in the park after a year.
The final number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490.

There are 3000 students in total, and half of them are over 16 years old. 

So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

### 

### Step 2. Calculate the number of male students over 16 years old
One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. 

So, the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500 / 4 = 375.

### 

### Step 3. Calculate the number of female students over 16 years old
The number of female students over 16 years old is the difference between the total number of students over 16 years old and the number of male students over 16 years old.

So, the number of female students over 16 years old is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

### 

### Step 4. Calculate the number of students under 16 years old
The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. 

So, the number of students under 16 years old is 3000 / 2 = 1500.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to first determine the number of laps each person can run.

### 2
Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

### 3
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so we add 4 to Bethany's laps to find Trey's laps.
Trey's laps = Bethany's laps + 4
Trey's laps = 10 + 4
Trey's laps = 14

### 4
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so we divide Trey's laps by 2 to find Shaelyn's laps.
Shaelyn's laps = Trey's laps / 2
Shaelyn's laps = 14 / 2
Shaelyn's laps = 7

### 5
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so we subtract 2 from Shaelyn's laps to find Quinn's laps.
Quinn's laps = Shaelyn's laps - 2
Quinn's laps = 7 - 2
Quinn's laps = 5

### 6
Now that we know Bethany's laps (10) and Quinn's laps (5), we can find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn by subtracting Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps.

1012,"**Step 1** Calculate the total capacity lost in the last 3 hours when the battery was losing 7% of the total capacity each hour.
The power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means it lost 7% * 3 = 21% of its total capacity in the last 3 hours.

**Step 2** Calculate the total capacity lost in the first 5 hours when the battery was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour.
The power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means it lost 9% * 5 = 45% of its total capacity in the first 5 hours.

**Step 3** Calculate the total capacity lost in the entire 8 hours.
The power bank lost 45% of its capacity in the first 5 hours and 21% of its capacity in the last 3 hours. This means it lost a total of 45% + 21% = 66% of its total capacity in the entire 8 hours.

**Step 4** Calculate the remaining capacity after 8 hours.
The power bank had 28% of its capacity remaining after 8 hours.

**Step 5** Calculate the original capacity of the power bank.
Since the power bank lost 66% of its capacity and had 28% remaining, we can set up the equation: original capacity - 66% = 28%. Solving for the original capacity, we get original capacity = 28% + 66% = 94%.

**Step 6** Calculate the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.
Since the power bank had 94% of its capacity when it started losing capacity, and it lost 66% of its capacity in total, we can set up the equation: 94% - x = 28%, where x is the capacity lost in the first 5 hours. Solving for x, we get x = 66%. However, we are looking for the charge when Maria went out to the park, which is the charge before the 9% loss. We know that the power bank lost 45% of its capacity in the first 5 hours. So, the charge when Maria went out to the park is 94% - 45% = 49%.

The family consists of a man, a wife, and a son. Each of them eats a certain number of sandwiches per day. To find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day, we need to add the number of sandwiches eaten by each family member.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

There are two blank lines below this step.

### 2. Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week
Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week.

Total sandwiches eaten in one week = Total sandwiches eaten per day * 7
= 11 * 7
= 77

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
- 80 cookies * $1 per cookie = $80

### 2
She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
- 60 cupcakes * $4 per cupcake = $240

### 3
Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
- Total earnings = $80 (cookies) + $240 (cupcakes) = $320

### 4
Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so she spent a total of:
- 2 sisters * $10 per sister = $20

### 5
Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = Total earnings - Amount spent = $320 - $20 = $300

### 6
Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

To find out how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the pencils separately.

The cost of the books is the number of books multiplied by the cost of each book.
The cost of the pencils is the number of pencils multiplied by the cost of each pencil.

### 2
The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

### 3
Now, we need to add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent by Ted.

### 4
The total amount spent by Ted is 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

### 5
However, we also need to consider the initial amount of money Ted had, which is 200 dollars.

### 6
Since Ted spent 66 dollars, we need to subtract this amount from the initial amount to find the remaining amount.

### 7
The remaining amount is 200 - 66 = 134 dollars.

### 2
We are told that Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, we add 2 feet to both the length and width of the bed.

### 3
The new length of the fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet, and the new width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

### 4
Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2.

So, Xavier's current height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the given information. Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

### 2
The second person took $80 more than the first person, so their share is x + 80.

### 3
The third person took twice what the second person took, so their share is 2(x + 80).

### 4
We know that the total amount is $1920, which is the sum of the shares of all three people. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

### 5
Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

### 7
Subtract 240 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

### Step 2. Calculate the fraction of a day worked each day
The painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day.

### Step 3. Convert the fraction to a decimal
To convert 3/8ths to a decimal, we divide 3 by 8.

### 6. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.

This gives us: 5x = 30.

### 7. Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x.

This gives us: x = 6.

### 8. Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set.

The number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, which is 6 + 4 = 10.

### 9. Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's price for each year from 2007 to 2010.

### 2
The car's initial price is $20000, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### 3
We can use the formula for depreciation: 
Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - depreciation rate)
Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - 0.21)

### 4
We will calculate the price of the car after depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

### 5
For the year 2008:
Price after depreciation = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)
Price after depreciation = $20000 * 0.79
Price after depreciation = $15800

### 6
For the year 2009:
Price after depreciation = $15800 * (1 - 0.21)
Price after depreciation = $15800 * 0.79
Price after depreciation = $12532

### 7
For the year 2010:
Price after depreciation = $12532 * (1 - 0.21)
Price after depreciation = $12532 * 0.79
Price after depreciation = $9885.88

### 8
Since we are looking for the price of the car in the year 2010, we will round the price to the nearest dollar.

### 9
The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9886.

### 10
We have found the price of the car in the year 2010.

There are 50 books in total, and half of them are written in English. 
So, the number of English books = 50 / 2 = 25

..

**Step 2** Calculate the number of books written in German
10% of the books are written in German. 
To find 10% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.1 (which is the decimal form of 10%).
So, the number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

..

**Step 3** Calculate the number of books written in Spanish
The total number of books written in English and German = 25 + 5 = 30
Since there are 50 books in total, the number of books written in Spanish = 50 - 30 = 20

..

**Step 4** Confirm the calculation
We have calculated the number of books written in English, German, and Spanish.
The total number of books written in English and German is 30, and the total number of books is 50.
So, the number of books written in Spanish is indeed 20.

===========================================================

To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she needs to cover from San Diego to New York City.

**Step 2** Subtract the distance Bernice has already driven from the total distance
=====================================================================

We know that Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we need to subtract this distance from the total distance.

**Step 3** Perform the subtraction
=============================

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven by Bernice = 325 kilometers

Distance left to drive = Total distance - Distance driven by Bernice
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

**Step 4** Determine the remaining distance
=====================================

After performing the subtraction, we get the remaining distance that Bernice needs to drive.

To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 * 1 = 1 SqFt.

We have a total area of 200 SqFt that needs to be covered with tiles. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile.

### 2
Now, let's calculate the total number of tiles required:

Total area = 200 SqFt
Area of each tile = 1 SqFt

Total number of tiles = Total area / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles = 200 / 1
Total number of tiles = 200

### 3
Since each tile costs $12, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total number of tiles = 200
Cost of each tile = $12

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats eat in a day.

### 2
Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day, so the total number of meals per day is 3 * 2 = 6.

### 3
Each meal consists of 60 grams of cat food, so the total amount of cat food eaten per day is 6 * 60 = 360 grams.

### 4
We need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last.

### 5
To do this, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount eaten per day (360 grams).

### 6
Performing the division: 720 / 360 = 2.

### 7
This means that 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

### 8
Therefore, Imma's cats will run out of cat food in 2 days.

The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. To find the total cost of the visit, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.

### 2. Convert 30 minutes to hours
There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 30 minutes is equal to 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

### 3. Calculate the cost of the doctor's visit
The cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.

### 4. Calculate the cost of the cast
The doctor charges $200 for the cast.

### 5. Calculate the cost of the painkillers
The doctor charges $4/pill for 30 painkillers. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

### 6. Calculate the cost of parking
The doctor charges $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

To find out how many emails James responds to in a day, we first need to calculate the number of emails that require a response. We can do this by finding 20% of the total number of emails he receives.

### 2
To find 20% of the total number of emails, we multiply the total number of emails by 0.2. 

### 3
The total number of emails James receives in a day is 80. We multiply 80 by 0.2 to find the number of emails that don't require a response.

### 4
80 * 0.2 = 16 emails don't require a response.

### 5
To find the number of emails that James responds to in a day, we subtract the number of emails that don't require a response from the total number of emails.

### 6
80 - 16 = 64 emails require a response.

### 7
Since James works for 5 days a week, we need to multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a week.

To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to first calculate the total score he achieved.

We know that John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so we can calculate the total score for these tests by multiplying the score by the number of tests:

* Score for the first 3 tests: 100 x 3 = 300

### 2
Next, we need to add the score of the 4th test to the total score of the first 3 tests.

* Score for the 4th test: 80
* Total score for all 4 tests: 300 + 80 = 380

### 3
Now that we have the total score for all 4 tests, we can calculate the average score by dividing the total score by the number of tests.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. To find out how many meatballs are in 7 meatball sub sandwiches, we need to multiply the number of meatball sub sandwiches by the number of meatballs in each sub sandwich.

7 meatball sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 28 meatballs.

####


### 3
Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. To find out how many meatball sub sandwiches are left, we need to subtract the number of sub sandwiches Mark ate from the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney ordered.

7 meatball sub sandwiches - 4 meatball sub sandwiches = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

####


### 4
Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. To find out the total number of meatball sub sandwiches left, we need to add the new sub sandwiches to the remaining sub sandwiches.

3 meatball sub sandwiches + 3 meatball sub sandwiches = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures.

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of trucks (20) by 1/4 (or 0.25).

### 2
The number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures is:
20 * 0.25 = 5 trucks

### 3
Now, we need to find the number of trucks that were able to deliver the fertiliser. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

### 4
The number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is:
20 - 5 = 15 trucks

### 5
Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered, we can multiply the number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser by the number of tons each truck was carrying.

1082,"### 1. Calculate the total distance James walked
James walked from home to the store and then back home. The distance from home to the store is 4 miles, and the distance from the store to home is also 4 miles. So, the total distance James walked is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

 

### 2. Determine the time James spent walking to the store
Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk to the store by dividing the distance to the store (4 miles) by his speed (4 miles per hour). This gives us 4 / 4 = 1 hour.

 

### 3. Determine the time James spent walking back home
Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk back home by dividing the distance from the store to home (4 miles) by his speed (4 miles per hour). This gives us 4 / 4 = 1 hour.

 

### 4. Calculate the total time James spent walking
To find the total time James spent walking, we add the time it took him to walk to the store (1 hour) and the time it took him to walk back home (1 hour). This gives us 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

 

### 5. Consider the time James spent walking to the halfway point
However, we need to consider that James walked to the halfway point before realizing he forgot something at home. Since the store is 4 miles away from home, the halfway point is 2 miles from home. It took James 2 / 4 = 0.5 hours to walk to the halfway point.

 

### 6. Calculate the total time James spent walking to the halfway point and back
To find the total time James spent walking to the halfway point and back, we add the time it took him to walk to the halfway point (0.5 hours) and the time it took him to walk back to the starting point (1 hour). This gives us 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 hours.

 

### 7. Determine the time James spent walking to the store after returning home
After returning home, James walked to the store. Since he had already walked to the halfway point, he still had to walk 2 miles to reach the store. It took James 2 / 4 = 0.5 hours to walk to the store.

 

### 8. Calculate the total time James spent walking to the store after returning home
To find the total time James spent walking to the store after returning home, we add the time it took him to walk to the halfway point (0.5 hours) and the time it took him to walk to the store (0.5 hours). This gives us 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 hour.

 

### 9. Calculate the total time James spent walking
To find the total time James spent walking, we add the time it took him to walk to the halfway point and back (1.5 hours) and the time it took him to walk to the store after returning home (1 hour). This gives us 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 hours.

 

### 10. Consider the time James spent walking to the store
However, we need to consider that James walked to the store after returning home. Since the store is 4 miles away from home, it took James 4 / 4 = 1 hour to walk to the store.

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas she bought.

She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:

10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

### 2
Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so:

40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

### 3
Next, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so:

10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

### 4
To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

$32.00 (individual) - $30.00 (bunches) = $2.00

### 5
However, we need to consider that Jenny bought 40 bananas, but she only paid for 10 bunches. This means she got 40 - (10 * 4) = 0 extra bananas for free.

### 6
Since she got 0 extra bananas for free, the cost of the bananas she got for free is $0.

### 7
The cost of the bananas she paid for is $30.00.

### 8
The cost of the bananas she got for free is $0.

### 9
The total cost of the bananas she got is $30.00.

### 10
The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is $32.00.

### 11
The amount of money Jenny saved is the difference between the cost of buying individually and the cost of buying in bunches:

$32.00 (individual) - $30.00 (bunches) = $2.00

The answer is: $2.00",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

The farmer is making 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck is picking up 3 bales of hay per hour. To find out how many bales are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.


### 2
Since the truck is picking up bales at the same time the farmer is making them, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer. This will give us the net change in the number of bales.

Net change in bales = bales made by farmer - bales picked up by truck
Net change in bales = 30 - 18
Net change in bales = 12


### 3
Since the net change in bales is 12, this means that the farmer is making 12 more bales than the truck is picking up. However, we are interested in the number of bales left in the field, not the net change.

To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to subtract the net change from the number of bales made by the farmer. However, since the farmer is making more bales than the truck is picking up, we can simply say that the number of bales left in the field is the difference between the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

### 5
Since the farmer is making 12 more bales than the truck is picking up, and the truck is picking up 18 bales, the total number of bales made by the farmer is 18 + 12 = 30.

To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we first need to determine the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, and there are three floors, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

##


### 2
The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. To find the height of the first bounce, we multiply the initial height by 2/3.

Height of first bounce = 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet

##


### 3
Now, we need to find the height of the second bounce. We will multiply the height of the first bounce by 2/3.

Height of second bounce = 48 * (2/3) = 32 feet

##


### 4
To confirm our calculation, we can multiply the height of the second bounce by 2/3 to see if we get the initial height back.

Height of third bounce = 32 * (2/3) = 21.33 feet (approximately)

##


### 5
However, we are interested in the height of the second bounce, not the third bounce. Our previous calculation in step 3 is correct.

##


### 6
We can also verify our calculation by checking if the height of the second bounce is 2/3 of the height of the first bounce.

Height of second bounce / Height of first bounce = 32 / 48 = 2/3

##


### 7
This confirms that our calculation in step 3 is correct.

##


### 8
We can also check if the height of the first bounce is 2/3 of the initial height.

Height of first bounce / Initial height = 48 / 72 = 2/3

##


### 9
This confirms that our calculation in step 2 is correct.

##


### 10
Now that we have verified our calculations, we can confidently say that the height of the ball on its second bounce is 32 feet.

The speed of the second train is half the speed of the first train, which is 60 miles per hour. So, the speed of the second train is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

 

**Step 2** Calculate the distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours
The distance traveled by the first train is its speed multiplied by the time traveled. So, the distance traveled by the first train is 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.

 

**Step 3** Calculate the distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours
The distance traveled by the second train is its speed multiplied by the time traveled. So, the distance traveled by the second train is 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles.

 

**Step 4** Calculate the total distance between the two trains
Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances they have traveled. So, the total distance between the two trains is 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the private cars.

### 2
We know that there were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

### 3
We also know that there were 20 private cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, the total number of people carried by the private cars is:

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

### 4
Now, we need to add the total number of people carried by the buses and the private cars to find the total number of people outside the church.

420 people (buses) + 60 people (cars) = 480 people

### 5
Since the problem asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

### 6
However, the problem does not provide the total number of people who attended the wedding. We can only assume that the total number of people outside the church is the total number of people who attended the wedding.

### 7
Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 0, assuming that everyone who attended the wedding was outside the church.

### 8
However, this is a very unlikely scenario, and it's more likely that the problem is asking for the number of people who were already inside the church before the ceremony.

There are numerous jellyfish in the tank, so we can represent the total number of jellyfish as x.

## 

**Step 2** A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can calculate the number of large jellyfish by dividing the total number of jellyfish by 5.

## 

**Step 3** A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3.

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color, so we can calculate the number of large jellyfish that change color by dividing the number of large jellyfish by 3.

## 

**Step 4** The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5.

Since the small jellyfish always stay blue, we can calculate the number of small jellyfish by subtracting the number of large jellyfish from the total number of jellyfish.

## 

**Step 5** We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which is equal to (x/5)/3.

Since 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up an equation to represent this: (x/5)/3 = 6.

## 

**Step 6** We can solve the equation (x/5)/3 = 6 for x.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15 (which is 5 * 3) to get x = 90.

## 

**Step 7** We can verify our solution by checking if the number of small jellyfish is consistent with the given information.

We can calculate the number of small jellyfish by subtracting the number of large jellyfish from the total number of jellyfish: x - x/5 = 90 - 90/5 = 90 - 18 = 72.

## 

**Step 8** We can also verify our solution by checking if the number of large jellyfish that change color is consistent with the given information.

We can calculate the number of large jellyfish that change color by dividing the number of large jellyfish by 3: (x/5)/3 = 90/15 = 6.

## 

**Step 9** Since our solution is consistent with the given information, we can conclude that the total number of jellyfish in the tank is indeed 90.

====================================================================

Lauren needs to save for 20 years of retirement. Assuming she lives on 40% of her current annual salary, her retirement expenses will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

**Step 2** Calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement
====================================================================

To calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save, we multiply her annual retirement expenses by the number of years she needs to save for: $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

**Step 3** Calculate the amount Lauren saves per year

To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon into 4 equal parts.

Each part will be 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm long.

### 2
Now, we need to divide each of these 4 parts into 5 equal parts.

So, we will divide 25 cm into 5 equal parts.

### 3
To find the length of each of these 5 equal parts, we will divide 25 cm by 5.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm.

### 4
Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

### 5
This is because we are cutting each of the 4 equal parts into 5 equal parts, resulting in a total of 20 equal parts (4 x 5).

### 6
Since the total length of the ribbon is 100 cm, we can verify that 20 parts of 5 cm each will indeed add up to 100 cm.

20 x 5 cm = 100 cm.

### 7
This confirms that our calculation is correct.

So, the total toys produced by 4 workers per hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculating Total Toys Produced by 4 Workers in 10 Hours
=============================================================

Since the 4 workers work for 10 hours, the total toys produced by them in 10 hours is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculating Total Toys Needed
=====================================

The manufacturer needs a total of 400 toys to ship the order, but they still need 20 more toys after the 10-hour shift. 
So, the total toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculating Total Toys Produced by 5 Workers in 10 Hours

The difference between the total toys produced by 5 workers and 4 workers in 10 hours is the toys produced by the 5th worker in 10 hours.
So, the toys produced by the 5th worker in 10 hours is 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Weight of Elijah's first dog = 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds


## 

**Step 2** Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog by multiplying 60 by 1/2.

Weight of Elijah's second dog = 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds


## 

**Step 3** Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs
To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to add the weights of his two dogs.

Total weight of Elijah's dogs = Weight of Elijah's first dog + Weight of Elijah's second dog
Total weight of Elijah's dogs = 15 + 30
Total weight of Elijah's dogs = 45 pounds

### 3
Since John buys 3 large bags, the total number of M&M's he has is:

### 4
Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 900 M&M's. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's.

To find the speed of the faster car, we need to understand the relationships between the speeds of the different cars.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which can go 120 Miles per hour.

### 2
We can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car by multiplying the speed of the average car by 5.

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour.

### 3
The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

### 4
We can calculate the speed of the faster car by multiplying the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour.

### 5
To confirm our calculation, we can check if the faster car is indeed 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

Faster car speed / 2nd fastest car speed = 750 / 600 = 1.25.

### 6
Since the ratio is correct, our calculation is accurate.

### 7
We can also check if the 2nd fastest car is indeed 5 times faster than the average car.

2nd fastest car speed / average car speed = 600 / 120 = 5.

### 8
Since the ratio is correct, our calculation is accurate.

Liam is 16 years old now, and two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.

### 2. Calculate Liam's age two years ago
Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

### 3. Use the information that Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince
Since Liam's age two years ago was 14 years, and it was twice the age of Vince, we can set up an equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

### 4. Solve for Vince's age two years ago
To find Vince's age two years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7 years.

### 5. Calculate Vince's current age
Since Vince was 7 years old two years ago, his current age would be 7 + 2 = 9 years.

1129,"**Step 1** Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.

Additionally, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.

###


**Step 2** We can use the information from Step 1 to express C and S in terms of one variable.

Since C = S + 12, we can substitute this expression for C into the equation C + S = 30.

This gives us (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms to get 2S + 12 = 30.

###


**Step 3** Now, let's solve the equation 2S + 12 = 30 for S.

Subtract 12 from both sides to get 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2 to get S = 9.

###


**Step 4** Now that we know S = 9, we can find C using the equation C = S + 12.

Substitute S = 9 into the equation to get C = 9 + 12.

This gives us C = 21.

###


**Step 5** We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that the total number of eggs painted is 56, so A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute A = M and C = 21, S = 9 into the equation to get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms to get 2A + 30 = 56.

###


**Step 6** Now, let's solve the equation 2A + 30 = 56 for A.

Subtract 30 from both sides to get 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2 to get A = 13.

###


**Step 7** Now that we know A = 13 and C = 21, we can find the difference between C and A.

C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

###


**Step 8** Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Nik has 200 crayons that he wants to separate into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes.

### Step 1. Calculate the total number of boxes needed
Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8. To find the total number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box.

```python
total_crayons = 200
crayons_per_box = 8
total_boxes = total_crayons / crayons_per_box
```

### Step 2. Calculate the total weight of the crayons
Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the total number of crayons.

```python
crayon_weight = 1
total_crayon_weight = total_crayons * crayon_weight
```

### Step 3. Calculate the total weight of the boxes
Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is equal to the total number of boxes multiplied by the weight of each box.

```python
box_weight = 8
total_box_weight = total_boxes * box_weight
```

### Step 4. Calculate the total weight of the crayons and boxes
To find the total weight, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes.

```python
total_weight = total_crayon_weight + total_box_weight
```

### Step 5. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds
Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the total weight in pounds.

```python
ounces_per_pound = 16
total_weight_pounds = total_weight / ounces_per_pound
```

To solve this problem, we need to first find out Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk.

### 2
Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, the time she spends on the beach can be calculated as 2/x minutes.

### 3
We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. So, we can set up the equation 2/x = 40 to find the value of x.

### 4
Solving the equation 2/x = 40, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

### 5
Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We are given that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We need to find out how many marbles Bob has initially.

### 2
First, let's convert 2 dozen into a numerical value. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen will be 2 * 12 = 24.

### 3
Now, we know that if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. So, to find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to subtract 24 from 60.

### 4
Let's calculate the initial number of marbles Bob has: 60 - 24 = 36.

### 5
Now, we are given that if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to find out how many marbles he will have left.

### 6
To find out how many marbles Bob will have left, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he has.

### 7
Let's calculate the number of marbles Bob will have left: 36 - 10 = 26.

### 8
Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles.

The cost of each pack of bagels is $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs. So, the total cost without discount is:
4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

There is a double new line here to separate the steps.

### Step 2. Calculate the discount amount
Russell receives a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount amount, we need to find 10% of $40.00:
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

There is a double new line here to separate the steps.

### Step 3. Calculate the total cost after discount
To find the total cost after discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount:
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

There is a double new line here to separate the steps.

### Step 4. Calculate the total number of bagels
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs. So, the total number of bagels is:

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, so we need to subtract 5 from 23.

Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

##


**Step 2** Calculate the number of potatoes needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
Let's denote the number of potatoes needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes as x.

We know that 3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.
We also know that 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can set up the equation 3 / 2 = x.

Solving for x, we get x = 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

##


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate.
Since Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop, we can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop.

Total potatoes = 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

##


**Step 4** Calculate the number of potatoes Gomer ate.
Since Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, we already know that Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
We also know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, which we already calculated as 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. We can use this ratio to find the total number of men and women on the bus.

### 3
Let's assume the common multiple for the ratio is x. This means the number of men is 5x and the number of women is 9x.

### 4
We are given that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can set up an equation to represent this: 5x + 9x = 84.

To find out how many bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce, we first need to calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people. Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can assume that 1 person's daily energy demand is 100% or 1 unit.

**Step 2** Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people in units
Total daily energy demand of 2300 people = 2300 people * 1 unit/person = 2300 units

**Step 3** Calculate the total daily energy demand that 1 bottle of juice can cover
Since each juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total daily energy demand that 1 bottle of juice can cover as follows:
Total daily energy demand that 1 bottle of juice can cover = 20% * 1 unit = 0.2 units

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of bottles of juices needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people
To find out how many bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce, we can divide the total daily energy demand of 2300 people by the total daily energy demand that 1 bottle of juice can cover:
Total number of bottles of juices needed = Total daily energy demand of 2300 people / Total daily energy demand that 1 bottle of juice can cover

To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce, we can subtract the number of bottles of juices Hortex can produce in a day from the total number of bottles of juices needed:
Number of bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce = Total number of bottles of juices needed - Number of bottles of juices Hortex can produce in a day
= 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles
= 7300 bottles

**Step 7** Calculate the number of bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people
Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Carla has 8 identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. We need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

### Step 1. Calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue
There are 8 babies in total. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies. 1/4 of them are dressed in blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies.

### 

### Step 2. Calculate the number of babies wearing bows
All 2 babies dressed in blue wear bows. 1/3 of the 6 babies dressed in purple also wear bows, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies. So, in total, 2 + 2 = 4 babies wear bows.

### 

### Step 3. Calculate the number of babies wearing purple and bows
We already know that 2 babies dressed in purple wear bows.

### 

### Step 4. Calculate the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple
The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2. The total number of babies wearing bows is 4. So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

### 

### Step 5. Convert the percentage to a decimal
The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%. To convert this to a decimal, we divide by 100: 50 / 100 = 0.5.

### 

### Step 6. Convert the decimal to a percentage
We already know that the decimal is 0.5. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

### 

### Step 7. Convert the percentage to a fraction
The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%. To convert this to a fraction, we divide by 100: 50 / 100 = 1/2.

### 

### Step 8. Calculate the final result
The final result is the fraction 1/2.

To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

### 2
First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each.
- Total apartments in the first two complexes = 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

### 3
Next, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex.
- The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- The other two combined have 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240 apartments.
- Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

### 4
Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- Total apartments = 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

### 5
Next, let's calculate the total number of collections per week.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place.
- Total collections per week = 3 * 3 = 9 collections per week.

### 6
Now, let's calculate the total payment per collection.
- John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment.
- Total payment per collection = $0.40.

### 7
Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.
- Total amount of money = Total apartments * Total collections per week * Total payment per collection.
- Total amount of money = 1040 * 9 * $0.40.

### 8
Now, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits it produces each year.

### 2
A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

### 3
A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

### 4
A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

### 5
An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. To find the number of fruits an 8-year-old tree produces, we need to calculate the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.

### 6
A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

### 7
Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, the number of fruits an 8-year-old tree produces is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Let's denote the length of the red rope as R, the length of the blue rope as B, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.

### 2. Express the relationship between the red and blue ropes
The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write this as:
R = 4B

### 3. Express the relationship between the blue and yellow ropes
The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write this as:
B = Y - 7

### 4. Express the relationship between the three ropes
The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write this as:
R + B + Y = 37

### 5. Substitute the expression for R from step 2 into the equation from step 4
Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get:
4B + B + Y = 37

### 6. Simplify the equation from step 5
Combining like terms, we get:
5B + Y = 37

### 7. Substitute the expression for B from step 3 into the equation from step 6
Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get:
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37

### 8. Simplify the equation from step 7
Expanding and combining like terms, we get:
5Y - 35 + Y = 37

### 9. Combine like terms and solve for Y
Combining like terms, we get:
6Y - 35 = 37
Adding 35 to both sides, we get:
6Y = 72
Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
Y = 12

### 10. Find the length of the blue rope
Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7:
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of money Rissa was given initially.

### 2
Let's assume Ronnie was given $x. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x.

### 3
After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, both Ronnie and Rissa are left with (x - y) and (3x - y) respectively, where y is the amount they gave to their sister.

### 4
We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation (3x - y) = (4/5)(3x).

### 5
Simplifying the equation, we get 3x - y = 12x/5.

### 6
We can also set up an equation for Ronnie, (x - y) = (1/5)x, since Ronnie is left with 1/5 of his money.

### 7
Now we have two equations, 3x - y = 12x/5 and x - y = x/5.

### 8
We can solve the second equation for y, y = x - x/5 = 4x/5.

### 9
Substituting y = 4x/5 into the first equation, we get 3x - 4x/5 = 12x/5.

### 10
Simplifying the equation, we get 15x/5 - 4x/5 = 12x/5.

### 11
Combine like terms, 11x/5 = 12x/5.

### 12
Subtract 11x/5 from both sides, we get 0 = x/5.

### 13
Since x/5 = 0, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get x = 0.

### 14
However, this is not possible since Ronnie was given $5. Let's go back to step 6 and solve for y.

### 15
We can rewrite the equation as y = x - x/5 = 4x/5.

### 16
Substitute y = 4x/5 into the first equation, 3x - 4x/5 = 12x/5.

### 17
Simplify the equation, 15x/5 - 4x/5 = 12x/5.

### 18
Combine like terms, 11x/5 = 12x/5.

### 19
Subtract 11x/5 from both sides, we get 0 = x/5.

### 20
Since x/5 = 0, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get x = 0.

### 21
However, this is not possible since Ronnie was given $5. Let's try a different approach.

### 22
Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = 15.

### 23
After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, both Ronnie and Rissa are left with (5 - y) and (15 - y) respectively.

### 24
We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation (15 - y) = (4/5)(15).

### 25
Simplifying the equation, we get 15 - y = 12.

### 26
Solving for y, we get y = 15 - 12 = 3.

### 27
Now that we know y, we can find the amount of money left in Ronnie's money.

### 28
Ronnie was given $5 and gave $3 to their little sister, so he is left with 5 - 3 = 2.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and use algebraic equations to represent the given information.

### 2
Let's assume the amount of red, white, and purple paint used is x pints each. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can represent the total amount of these three colors as 3x pints.

### 3
We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the amount of yellow paint used is half of the total amount of paint used, which is 12 pints. So, the amount of yellow paint used is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

### 4
The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

### 5
Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 6 = 12.

### 6
Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 6.

### 7
Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 2.

### 8
Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint used, the amount of red paint used is x pints.

### 9
Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

### 10
We can now conclude that the amount of red paint used is 2.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used up 45% of it on Monday. To find the amount of chalk used, we need to calculate 45% of 5 inches.

The chalk used on Monday is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

**Step 2** Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday
Since the teacher used up 2.25 inches of chalk, we subtract this from the original 5-inch piece to find the remaining chalk.

The remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

**Step 3** Determine the chalk usage rate
The teacher tries to conserve chalk by using only 20% of it each day. This means that 20% of the remaining chalk will be used up each day.

**Step 4** Calculate the daily chalk usage
To find the daily chalk usage, we need to calculate 20% of the remaining chalk.

The daily chalk usage is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

**Step 5** Calculate the number of days the chalk will last
To find the number of days the chalk will last, we need to divide the remaining chalk by the daily chalk usage.

The number of days the chalk will last is 2.75 / 0.55 = 5 days.

**Step 6** Check if the chalk will be recycled before it runs out
Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to check if the chalk will be recycled before it runs out.

The chalk will not be recycled before it runs out, since it will last for 5 days and will not be smaller than 2 inches until then.

To find the total amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we first need to calculate the total cost of the milk he purchased.

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. 

### 2
We can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5

### 3
Now, let's calculate the total cost.

Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14000

### 4
Next, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus could not sell due to expiry.

2/5 of the milk was past its expiry date.

### 5
We can calculate the amount of milk that was past its expiry date by multiplying the total amount of milk by the fraction that was past its expiry date.

Amount of expired milk = Total amount of milk * Fraction past expiry date
Amount of expired milk = 4000 * (2/5)

### 6
Now, let's calculate the amount of expired milk.

Amount of expired milk = 4000 * (2/5)
Amount of expired milk = 4000 * 0.4
Amount of expired milk = 1600 gallons

### 7
Since Mr. Marcellus returned the expired milk to the company, he is entitled to a refund for the cost of the expired milk.

### 8
We can calculate the refund by multiplying the amount of expired milk by the cost per gallon.

Refund = Amount of expired milk * Cost per gallon
Refund = 1600 * $3.5

We are given two pieces of information:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can represent these statements as equations:

1. W = 5(C + 7)
2. C + 25 = (1/3)W

**Step 2** We can simplify the first equation by distributing the 5:

1. W = 5C + 35

**Step 3** Now we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

**Step 4** Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

**Step 5** Subtract 3C from both sides to isolate the variable C:

75 = 2C + 35

**Step 6** Subtract 35 from both sides to further isolate C:

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out the total number of books he can buy with $27000, we need to divide $27000 by $500.

### 3
$27000 ÷ $500 = 54. This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27000.

### 4
Since Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books, we need to multiply 54 by 100 to find out the total number of books he can buy.

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends. 
So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 4 * 6 = 24.

#### 3. Calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices needed
Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by 12 to find the number of cheese pizzas needed.
So, the total number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

#### 4. Calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed
Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by 8 to find the number of pepperoni pizzas needed.
So, the total number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can build per hour.

### 2
Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, we need to calculate the total number of snowballs that melt in an hour.

### 3
The number of snowballs that melt in an hour is 2 * 4 = 8.

### 4
Now, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can build per hour. This is the number of snowballs he builds minus the number that melt.

### 5
The net number of snowballs Jay can build per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

### 6
Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many hours it will take him to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 per hour.

### 7
To do this, we divide the total number of snowballs needed (60) by the net number of snowballs Jay can build per hour (12).

### 8
60 / 12 = 5.

### 9
However, we also need to consider the initial number of snowballs Jay has. Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes, we need to calculate how many snowballs he has at the start.

### 10
Let's assume Jay starts with 0 snowballs. In the first hour, he builds 20 snowballs, but 8 melt, so he has 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

### 11
In the second hour, he builds 20 more snowballs, but 8 melt, so he has 12 + 20 - 8 = 24 snowballs.

### 12
We can continue this process until Jay has 60 snowballs.

### 13
After the first hour, Jay has 12 snowballs.
After the second hour, Jay has 24 snowballs.
After the third hour, Jay has 36 snowballs.
After the fourth hour, Jay has 48 snowballs.
After the fifth hour, Jay has 60 snowballs.

### 14
Since Jay needs 5 hours to build 60 snowballs, but he already has 60 snowballs after 5 hours, the total time it will take before he has 60 snowballs is 5 hours.

There are two pieces of information given:
- John was twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release.
- John is 28 now.

We need to find Jim's current age.

## 

**Step 2** We can express the first piece of information as an equation: J = 2M.

## 

**Step 3** Since John is 28 now, we can express his age at the time of Digimon's release as J = 28 - x, where x is the number of years that have passed since Digimon's release.

## 

**Step 4** We can substitute J = 28 - x into the equation J = 2M to get 28 - x = 2M.

## 

**Step 5** We can rearrange the equation 28 - x = 2M to solve for M: M = (28 - x) / 2.

## 

**Step 6** Since we want to find Jim's current age, we need to find the value of x. We know that John is 28 now, so x = 20 (since Digimon had its 20th anniversary).

## 

**Step 7** We can substitute x = 20 into the equation M = (28 - x) / 2 to find Jim's current age: M = (28 - 20) / 2 = 4.

## 

**Step 8** Therefore, Jim is 4 years old now.

## 

**Step 9** Since we want to find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we can subtract 20 from Jim's current age: M = 4 - 20 = -16.

## 

**Step 10** However, since age cannot be negative, we can conclude that the problem is asking for Jim's current age, which is 4.

Cost of one bottle of cognac = Cost of one bottle of scotch + (50% of cost of one bottle of scotch)
Cost of one bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60)
Cost of one bottle of cognac = $60 + $30
Cost of one bottle of cognac = $90


##


**Step 4** Calculate the total cost of cognac
Now that we know the cost of one bottle of cognac and the number of bottles John buys, we can calculate the total cost of cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost of one bottle of cognac
Total cost of cognac = 20 * $90
Total cost of cognac = $1800


##


**Step 5** Calculate the total cost of everything
To find the total cost of everything, we add the total cost of scotch and the total cost of cognac:

Total cost of everything = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total cost of everything = $600 + $1800
Total cost of everything = $2400


##


**Step 6** Final result
The final result is the total cost of everything John spends on scotch and cognac.

Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

### Step 2. Calculate the remaining root beer after the children drank some
The children drank 4 gallons of root beer, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

### Step 3. Calculate the remaining root beer after Barbie spilled some
Barbie spilled 7 gallons of root beer, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

### Step 4. Calculate the remaining root beer after Ronnie drank some
Ronnie drank 5 gallons of root beer, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

### Step 5. Calculate the number of people sharing the root beer
There are 3 people (Fred and the others) sharing the root beer, and 1 more person (Fred) so the total number of people is 3 + 1 = 4.

### Step 6. Calculate the amount of root beer available for each person
To find out how much root beer each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people: 8 / 4 = 2 gallons.

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as x.

We are given the equation: 8 + 4x = 40

### 2
To find the value of x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation.

### 3
First, let's subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.

8 + 4x - 8 = 40 - 8

### 4
This simplifies to:

4x = 32

### 5
Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x.

4x / 4 = 32 / 4

### 6
This simplifies to:

x = 8

### 7
Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

### 8
We can verify our answer by plugging x = 8 back into the original equation:

8 + 4(8) = 8 + 32 = 40

### 9
This confirms that our solution is correct.

=====================================================

There are 66 fish in the tank, and one-third of them have red stripes. To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to divide the total number of fish by 3.

66 / 3 = 22

There are 22 fish with red stripes.

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the number of fish without red stripes
=====================================================

Since there are 22 fish with red stripes, we need to subtract this number from the total number of fish to find the number of fish without red stripes.

66 - 22 = 44

There are 44 fish without red stripes.

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes
=====================================================

5/11 of the remaining fish (without red stripes) have blue stripes. To find the number of fish with blue stripes, we need to multiply the number of fish without red stripes by 5/11.

44 * (5/11) = 20

There are 20 fish with blue stripes.

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculate the total number of fish with red and blue stripes
=====================================================

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we need to add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

22 + 20 = 42

There are 42 fish with red and blue stripes.

1203,"### Step 1. Determine the height of the two-story house
The height of the two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall, we can calculate the height of the two-story house as follows:

* The height of the two-story house = 7 * height of Mattison
* The height of the two-story house = 7 * 60
* The height of the two-story house = 420 inches

### Step 2. Determine the height of the first floor
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. We can calculate the height of the first floor as follows:

* The height of the first floor = 3 * height of Mattison
* The height of the first floor = 3 * 60
* The height of the first floor = 180 inches

### Step 3. Determine the height of the second floor
Since the height of the two-story house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, we can calculate the height of the second floor as follows:

* The height of the second floor = height of the two-story house - height of the first floor
* The height of the second floor = 420 - 180
* The height of the second floor = 240 inches

### Step 4. Determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor
To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to know the height of the roof from the top of the second floor. However, we are given that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. This implies that the height of the roof from the top of the second floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the roof from the top of the second floor minus the height of the second floor.

* The height of the roof from the second floor's floor = height of the roof from the top of the second floor - height of the second floor
* The height of the roof from the second floor's floor = 180 - 240
* The height of the roof from the second floor's floor = -60

However, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor cannot be negative. This means that the height of the roof from the top of the second floor is actually less than the height of the second floor. Since we are given that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, we can conclude that the height of the roof from the top of the second floor is actually the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. However, this is not possible because the height of the roof from the top of the second floor should be greater than the height of the second floor. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our previous steps.

* The height of the roof from the top of the second floor = 180 + 240
* The height of the roof from the top of the second floor = 420

The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. To find the volume, we multiply the area of the base by the height.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

### 

### Step 2. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar
Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we divide the volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans that can fit.

The total number of jelly beans is 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

### 

### Step 3. Calculate the number of red jelly beans that can fit in the jar
Since the efficiency of packing is 80%, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.8 to find the number of jelly beans that can actually fit.

The number of jelly beans that can fit is 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

### 

### Step 4. Calculate the number of red jelly beans
Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we multiply the number of jelly beans that can fit by 0.3 to find the number of red jelly beans.

The number of red jelly beans is 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

### 

### Step 5. Calculate the difference between the estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number
The true number of red jelly beans is 900. We subtract the estimated number of red jelly beans from the true number to find the difference.

The difference is 900 - 864 = 36.

### 

### Step 6. Determine how far off the guess was
Since the difference is 36, we can say that the guess was 36 off.

### 

### Step 7. Determine the percentage difference
To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the true number and multiply by 100.

The percentage difference is (36 / 900) * 100 = 4%.

The guess was 4% off.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. So, the cost of 3 visits per year is $2 * 3 = $6 per year.

### Step 2. Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years
Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year for 5 years, the total number of visits is 3 * 5 = 15. The total cost for the first 5 years is $6 * 5 = $30.

### Step 3. Calculate the new cost of one visit after the increase
The cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5.

### Step 4. Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years
Since Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, the total number of visits for the next 3 years is 3 * 3 = 9. The total cost for the next 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15.

### Step 5. Calculate the total cost for all visits
The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years. Total cost = $30 + $15 = $45.

### Step 6. Add the cost of the last 3 years to the total cost
Pauline continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. The cost for these 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15. The total cost for all visits is $45 + $15 = $60.

### Step 7. Add the cost of the first 5 years to the cost of the last 3 years
Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost for these 5 years is $6 * 5 = $30. The total cost for all visits is $30 + $30 = $60.

### Step 8. Add the cost of the last 3 years to the total cost
Pauline continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. The cost for these 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15. The total cost for all visits is $60 + $15 = $75.

### Step 9. Add the cost of the first 5 years to the cost of the last 3 years
Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost for these 5 years is $6 * 5 = $30. Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 3 years. The cost for these 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15. The total cost for all visits is $30 + $15 = $45. Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 3 years. The cost for these 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15. The total cost for all visits is $45 + $15 = $60.

### Step 10. Add the cost of the first 5 years to the cost of the last 3 years
Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 5 years. The cost for these 5 years is $6 * 5 = $30. Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 3 years. The cost for these 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15. The total cost for all visits is $30 + $15 = $45. Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year for 3 years. The cost for these 3 years is $5 * 3 = $15. The total cost for all visits is $45 + $15 = $60.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade. To find the total number of students, we multiply the number of grades by the number of students in each grade.

There are 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students in total.

### Step 2. Determine the number of groups that can try the escape room
Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group.

Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

### Step 3. Determine the time it takes for one group to try the escape room
Each group has 45 minutes to try and escape the room.

### Step 4. Calculate the total time it takes for all groups to try the escape room
Since there are 5 groups and each group takes 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time per group.

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

### Step 5. Convert the total time to hours (optional)
Since the question does not specify the unit of time, we can leave the answer in minutes or convert it to hours. We will leave it in minutes for now.

The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is 4x.

## 

**Step 2** Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces must be equal to 40.

## 

**Step 3** We can write an equation to represent this relationship: x + 4x = 40.

## 

**Step 4** Combine like terms: 5x = 40.

## 

**Step 5** Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x: x = 8.

1232,"### Problem Explanation
Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. We need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away.

### Step 1. Determine the number of pomelos Eve is left with
Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. Since she originally had 20 pieces, we can calculate the number of pomelos she is left with as follows:

20 * 1/4 = 5

### Step 2. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve gave away
To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she is left with from the original number of pomelos.

20 - 5 = 15

### Step 3. Verify the result
We can verify our result by checking if it makes sense in the context of the problem. If Eve gave away 15 pomelos, she would be left with 5, which is 1/4 of the original 20 pomelos.

1233,"**Step 1** Calculate the number of apples Walter ate
Walter ate 2/5 of 60 apples. To find out how many apples he ate, we need to multiply 60 by 2/5.

```python
apples_eaten = 60 * (2/5)
```

The result is 24 apples.

## 

**Step 2** Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some
To find out how many apples are remaining, we need to subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples.

```python
apples_remaining = 60 - 24
```

The result is 36 apples.

## 

**Step 3** Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister
Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find out how many apples he gave, we need to multiply the remaining apples by 25% (or 0.25).

```python
apples_given_to_sister = 36 * 0.25
```

The result is 9 apples.

## 

**Step 4** Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter gave some to his sister
To find out how many apples are remaining, we need to subtract the number of apples given to his sister from the remaining apples.

```python
apples_remaining_after_giving = 36 - 9
```

The result is 27 apples.

## 

**Step 5** Calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples
Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we need to multiply the number of remaining apples by the price per apple.

1236,"### Step 1. Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother
Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass. 
So, the number of grapes used by her brother is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

## 

### Step 2. Calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother
The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is the sum of the grapes eaten by Madeline and the grapes used by her brother.
So, the total number of grapes used is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

## 

### Step 3. Calculate the number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used them
Let's assume the total number of grapes at the beginning is x.
The number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used them is x - 36.

## 

### Step 4. Calculate the number of pies that can be made with the remaining grapes
The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.
So, the number of grapes used to make 4 pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

## 

### Step 5. Calculate the number of grapes remaining after making pies
The number of grapes remaining after making pies is the difference between the grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used them and the grapes used to make pies.
So, the number of grapes remaining is (x - 36) - 48.

## 

### Step 6. Set up an equation to find the total number of grapes at the beginning
Since the number of grapes remaining after making pies is 0, we can set up the equation (x - 36) - 48 = 0.

## 

### Step 7. Solve the equation to find the total number of grapes at the beginning
Solving the equation (x - 36) - 48 = 0, we get x - 36 = 48.
Adding 36 to both sides, we get x = 84.

## 

### Step 8. Check if the solution makes sense
Since Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used 30 grapes, the total number of grapes used is 36.
The number of grapes remaining after making pies is 0, which means the total number of grapes used is equal to the total number of grapes at the beginning minus the grapes used to make pies.
So, the solution x = 84 makes sense.

## 

### Step 9. State the final result
The final result is the total number of grapes at the beginning.

Each shelf can hold the following number of books:
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

### 2. Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase
To find the total capacity of one bookcase, we need to add the capacity of all shelves in one bookcase. Since there are 2 middle shelves, we multiply the capacity of one middle shelf by 2.

Total capacity of one bookcase = (2 * 10) + 20 + 15

Total capacity of one bookcase = 55 books

To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total revenue from selling them.

### 2
Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, five dozens will be 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

### 3
The cost of one dozen eggs is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost of 60 eggs will be 60 * $2.40 = $144.

### 4
Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. This means she will sell 60 eggs for (60 / 3) * $1 = $20.

### 5
To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, the profit will be $20 - $144 = -$124.

### 6
However, since we cannot have a negative profit, we need to re-evaluate the selling price. The selling price of $1 for 3 eggs is too low, and Rose will not make a profit at this price.

### 7
Let's assume Rose sells the eggs at a higher price, say x dollars for 3 eggs. Then, the total revenue will be (60 / 3) * x = 20x dollars.

### 8
To make a profit, the total revenue should be greater than the total cost. So, we set up the inequality 20x > 144.

### 9
Solving the inequality, we get x > 7.2. This means Rose should sell the eggs for more than $7.20 for 3 eggs to make a profit.

### 10
However, since we are asked to find the profit at the given selling price of $1 for 3 eggs, we will use the initial calculation of -$124 as the profit.

Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly to pass 6th grade. Since she has to take two tests, we need to calculate the total number of questions first. However, we don't know the total number of questions in the second test yet.

### 2. Calculate the total number of questions in the second test
Let's assume the total number of questions in the second test is x. Then, the total number of questions in both tests is 70 + x.

### 3. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly
Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, which is 0.7(70 + x).

Since Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can set up the equation: 0.7(70 + x) = 42 + y.

### 7. Solve for y
We know that the second test has 40 questions, so x = 40. Substituting this value into the equation, we get: 0.7(70 + 40) = 42 + y. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.7(110) = 42 + y. Multiplying 0.7 and 110, we get: 77 = 42 + y. Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get: y = 35.

### 8. Check if Audrey can pass 6th grade with the calculated number of correct answers
Since Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can check if she can pass 6th grade with 35 correct answers. The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 70% of 110 is 0.7(110) = 77. Since Audrey answered 42 questions correctly in the first test and 35 questions correctly in the second test, she answered a total of 42 + 35 = 77 questions correctly. Therefore, she can pass 6th grade with the calculated number of correct answers.

Since Audrey answered 35 questions correctly in the second test, we can check if she can pass 6th grade. The total number of questions in the second test is 40. 70% of 40 is 0.7(40) = 28. Since Audrey answered 35 questions correctly in the second test, she answered more than 28 questions correctly.

To find out how many chips each person gets, we first need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell bought.

There are two bags of chips with 55 chips each, so we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag.

#### 
2 * 55 = 110 chips

### 2
Now that we know the total number of chips, we need to divide this number by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

There are five family members, so we divide the total number of chips by 5.

#### 
110 chips / 5 = 22 chips per person

### 3
Since we want to make sure that each person gets the same number of chips, we can confirm that the division is exact.

In this case, the division is exact, so each person will get 22 chips.

### 4
To summarize, we have calculated the total number of chips and divided it by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

The final result is 22",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints2MathFormat'}

To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

### 2
The first side takes 5 minutes to solve.

### 3
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, which is 2 * 5 = 10 minutes.

### 4
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, which is 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

### 5
We have a total of 6 sides, and we already know the time taken for the first and last two sides. We need to add the time taken for the second and third sides.

### 6
The total time taken for the first side is 5 minutes, the second and third sides is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes, and the last two sides is 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 minutes.

### 7
Now, we add up the time taken for all the sides: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes.

There are 20 helmets in the changing room.

### Step 2. Calculate the number of robots
Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can calculate the number of robots by dividing the number of helmets by 2.
20 / 2 = 10 robots

### Step 3. Determine the number of helmets and robots combined
We already know that there are 20 helmets and 10 robots.
20 (helmets) + 10 (robots) = 30 items

### Step 4. Calculate the number of footballs
Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can calculate the number of footballs by multiplying the number of helmets by 2.
20 * 2 = 40 footballs

### Step 5. Determine the total number of items
We already know that there are 30 items (helmets and robots combined) and 40 footballs.
However, we need to consider that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. This means that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Therefore, the total number of items is the sum of the number of footballs and the number of robots.

### Step 6. Calculate the total number of items
Since the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs, we can say that the number of robots is 1/4 of the number of footballs.
10 (robots) = 1/4 * 40 (football)
So, the total number of items is the sum of the number of footballs and the number of robots.
40 (football) + 10 (robots) = 50 items

### Step 7. Verify the result
We can verify the result by checking if the number of helmets is half the number of footballs, and the number of robots is half the number of helmets.
20 (helmets) = 1/2 * 40 (football)
10 (robots) = 1/2 * 20 (helmets)

====================================================================

To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we first need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends at work. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

## 

**Step 2** Calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a day
====================================================================

Now that we know Tim spends 360 minutes at work each day, we can calculate the number of calls he deals with by dividing this number by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes).

360 minutes/day / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

## 

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week
====================================================================

To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we can multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5.

#### 1. Determine the drying time for the old varnish
The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting.

#### 2. Determine the drying time for the new varnish
The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.

#### 3. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish
Since there are 6 paintings, we multiply the drying time for one painting by 6.
Total drying time for old varnish = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

#### 4. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish
Since there are 6 paintings, we multiply the drying time for one painting by 6.
Total drying time for new varnish = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

#### 5. Find the difference in drying time between the new and old varnish
To find out how much longer it takes for the new varnish to dry, we subtract the total drying time for the old varnish from the total drying time for the new varnish.
Difference in drying time = Total drying time for new varnish - Total drying time for old varnish
= 72 minutes - 42 minutes
= 30 minutes

#### 6. Conclusion
It will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

Phineas Frog needs to return home after being washed away by a rainstorm. He has to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of it on land and the other half in water. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute, and his speed in water is 10 yards per minute.

### Step 1. Calculate the distance to be covered on land
Phineas needs to cover half of the total distance on land, which is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

### Step 2. Calculate the time taken to cover the distance on land
Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To cover 100 yards on land, he will take 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

### Step 3. Calculate the distance to be covered in water
Phineas needs to cover the other half of the total distance in water, which is also 200 / 2 = 100 yards.

### Step 4. Calculate the time taken to cover the distance in water
Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To cover 100 yards in water, he will take 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

### Step 5. Calculate the total time taken to return home
The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to cover the distance on land and the time taken to cover the distance in water, which is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.

To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we first need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

* 1 dozen = 12 doughnuts
* 10 dozen = 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts

So, Derrick sells 120 doughnuts every day.

### 2
Next, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June.

* June has 30 days
* Derrick sells 120 doughnuts every day
* Total doughnuts sold in June = 30 x 120 = 3600 doughnuts

### 3
Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June.

* Derrick sells each doughnut for $2
* Total amount of money made in June = Total doughnuts sold x Price per doughnut
* Total amount of money made in June = 3600 x $2

### 4
To find the total amount of money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut.

* Total amount of money made in June = 3600 x $2 = $7200

### 5
Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's new speaking speed after training.

### 2
John's normally speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.

### 3
To find John's new speaking speed, we multiply his starting speed by 2.5.

### 4
New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

### 5
Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page having 450 words.

### 6
Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

### 7
Now, we need to find out how long it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

### 8
Time = Total words / New speaking speed = 4500 words / 375 WPM

### 9
To find the time in minutes, we divide the total words by the new speaking speed.

He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, so he needs to make a total of 5 gallons.

 

**Step 2** Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 5 gallons of lemonade.
For each gallon of lemonade, 1 cup of lemon juice is needed. So for 5 gallons, 5 cups of lemon juice are needed.

 

**Step 3** Calculate the total amount of lemons needed to get 5 cups of lemon juice.
Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.

 

**Step 4** Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups.

 

**Step 5** Calculate the additional lemons needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 2 cups of juice, Tim will need 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

 

**Step 6** Calculate the total number of lemons needed, including the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
The total number of lemons needed is the sum of the lemons needed for the regular gallons and the extra gallon, which is 30 + 12 = 42 lemons.

The Kennel house keeps 3 German Shepherds and each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.

The total daily consumption of dog food by the German Shepherds is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms/Shepherd = 15 kilograms/day

------------------------

**Step 2** Calculate the total daily consumption of dog food by the Bulldogs.
The Kennel house keeps 2 Bulldogs and each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.

The total daily consumption of dog food by the Bulldogs is:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms/Bulldog = 6 kilograms/day

------------------------

**Step 3** Calculate the total daily consumption of dog food by all the dogs.
The total daily consumption of dog food by all the dogs is the sum of the consumption by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs.

Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms/day (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms/day (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms/day

------------------------

**Step 4** Calculate the total weekly consumption of dog food by all the dogs.
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total daily consumption by 7.

Total weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 147 kilograms/week

To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and then add them together.

Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs, and there are 10 of them. So, the total number of legs for 2-legged animals is:
- 2 legs per animal
- 10 animals
- Total legs for 2-legged animals = 2 * 10 = 20 legs

Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs, and there are 15 of them. So, the total number of legs for 4-legged animals is:
- 4 legs per animal
- 15 animals
- Total legs for 4-legged animals = 4 * 15 = 60 legs


### 2
Now, we need to add the total number of legs for 2-legged animals and 4-legged animals to find the overall total number of legs on the farm.
- Total legs for 2-legged animals = 20 legs
- Total legs for 4-legged animals = 60 legs
- Total legs on the farm = 20 + 60 = 80 legs


### 3
Since we are asked to find the number of pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2.
- Total legs on the farm = 80 legs
- Number of pairs of legs = 80 / 2 = 40 pairs

We are given that the tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. Let's start by finding the number of yellow blocks.

There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

There are 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, which makes a total of 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.

### 2
Since there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
= 32 - (4 + 8)
= 32 - 12
= 20

### 3
Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

### 4
To confirm our answer, let's add up the number of blue, yellow, and red blocks to make sure it equals the total number of blocks.

Total number of blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks + Number of red blocks
= 4 + 8 + 20
= 32

### 5
Since the total number of blocks is indeed 32, our answer is correct.

### 6
We can also express the number of red blocks as a fraction of the total number of blocks.

Fraction of red blocks = Number of red blocks / Total number of blocks
= 20 / 32
= 5/8

### 7
This fraction tells us that the red blocks make up 5/8 of the total number of blocks.

### 8
We can also express the number of red blocks as a percentage of the total number of blocks.

Percentage of red blocks = (Number of red blocks / Total number of blocks) * 100
= (20 / 32) * 100
= 62.5%

### 9
This percentage tells us that the red blocks make up 62.5% of the total number of blocks.

### 10
In conclusion, there are 20 red blocks in the tower, which makes up 5/8 or 62.5% of the total number of blocks.

**Step 2** Calculate the distance traveled east
Elvis travels east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time.

There is a double new line here


**Step 3** Calculate the net distance from the house
Since Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to find the net distance from the house. We subtract the distance traveled east from the distance traveled west.

Net Distance = Distance West - Distance East
Net Distance = 90 miles - 144 miles
Net Distance = -54 miles

There is a double new line here

To find the total age of all siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother.

The age of the older brother can be calculated by doubling the age of the younger brother, since the younger brother is half the age of the older brother.

### 2
Given that the younger brother is 12 years old, we can calculate the age of the older brother as follows:

- Age of the younger brother: 12 years
- Age of the older brother: 2 * Age of the younger brother = 2 * 12 = 24 years

### 3
Now that we know the age of the older brother, we can calculate the total age of all siblings by adding the ages of all siblings together.

- Age of the older brother: 24 years
- Age of the younger brother: 12 years
- Age of the sisters: 16 years (since there are 3 sisters, the total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48 years)

### 4
To find the total age of all siblings, we add the ages of the older brother, the younger brother, and the sisters together.

- Total age of the siblings: Age of the older brother + Age of the younger brother + Total age of the sisters
- Total age of the siblings: 24 + 12 + 48

### 5
Now we can calculate the total age of all siblings.

- Total age of the siblings: 24 + 12 + 48 = 84

### 6
Since we have calculated the total age of all siblings, we can now provide the final answer.

### 7
The total age of all siblings is the sum of the ages of the older brother, the younger brother, and the sisters.

### 8
We have already calculated the total age of all siblings in step 5.

To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we first need to determine the total number of bars produced in two weeks.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. To find out how many bars are produced in two weeks, we need to multiply the number of bars produced in one day by the number of days in two weeks.

### 2
There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days in two weeks.

### 3
Now, we can multiply the number of bars produced in one day by the number of days in two weeks to find the total number of bars produced in two weeks.

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

### 4
The company sells all the produced bars for $2 per bar. To find out how much money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to multiply the total number of bars produced in two weeks by the price per bar.

### 5
Now, we can multiply the total number of bars produced in two weeks by the price per bar to find the total amount of money the company will receive.

70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

### 6
Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

### 7
To confirm our answer, let's calculate the daily revenue of the company.

5000 bars/day * $2/bar = $10,000/day

Josh is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week.

There are 7 days in a week, and Josh is open 5 days a week, so he is open 5/7 of the week.

## 
**Step 2** Calculate the number of days Josh is open in 2 weeks
Since Josh is open 5/7 of the week, in 2 weeks he will be open 2 * (5/7) = 10/7 of the weeks.

To convert this to a whole number of days, we can multiply by 7: 10/7 * 7 = 10 days.

## 
**Step 3** Calculate the number of cars Josh services in 2 weeks
Josh services 3 cars a day, and he is open 10 days in 2 weeks, so he will service 3 * 10 = 30 cars in 2 weeks.

## 
**Step 4** Calculate Josh's total earnings in 2 weeks
Josh gets paid $4 per car, and he services 30 cars in 2 weeks, so his total earnings will be 4 * 30 = $120.

## 
**Step 5** Calculate Josh's earnings per week
Since Josh earns $120 in 2 weeks, we can divide this by 2 to find his earnings per week: $120 / 2 = $60 per week.

## 
**Step 6** Calculate Josh's earnings per day
Since Josh earns $60 per week, and he is open 5 days a week, we can divide this by 5 to find his earnings per day: $60 / 5 = $12 per day.

## 
**Step 7** Calculate Josh's earnings per car
Since Josh earns $12 per day, and he services 3 cars a day, we can divide this by 3 to find his earnings per car: $12 / 3 = $4 per car.

## 
**Step 8** Verify Josh's earnings per car
Josh gets paid $4 per car, which matches our calculation in step 7.

## 
**Step 9** Verify Josh's total earnings in 2 weeks
Josh services 30 cars in 2 weeks, and he gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings will be 4 * 30 = $120, which matches our calculation in step 4.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many days it takes Nate to fill them in.

### 2
First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days.

### 3
The total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

### 4
Now, let's consider the situation when Nate gets home. The dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night, but Nate fills in 9 holes a day.

### 5
To simplify the problem, we can calculate the net change in the number of holes each day. Nate fills in 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new holes, so the net change is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled per day.

### 6
However, we need to consider the initial number of holes, which is 84. Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to account for this in our calculation.

### 7
Let's calculate the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. We can use the formula: total holes / net change per day.

### 8
However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add 6 to the total number of holes each day. So, the correct formula is: (total holes + 6 * number of days) / net change per day.

### 9
We can simplify this formula by calculating the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes without considering the dog's nightly digging. This is given by: total holes / net change per day = 84 / 3 = 28 days.

### 10
However, since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, we need to add 6 * 28 = 168 holes to the total number of holes. But we already know that Nate will fill in 9 holes a day, so we can simply add 6 * 28 days to the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes.

### 11
The number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 28 days + 6 * 28 days = 28 days + 168 days = 196 days.

### 12
To convert the number of days to weeks, we can divide the number of days by 7.

### 13
The number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 196 days / 7 days/week = 28 weeks.

### 14
However, we need to consider the last week, which is not a complete week. Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, and there are 7 days in a week, he will fill in 63 holes in the last week (9 * 7 = 63).

To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total cost price of all the watermelons.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

### 2
We can calculate the cost price of each watermelon by dividing the total cost price by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of each watermelon = Total cost price / Number of watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

### 3
Now, we need to calculate the selling price of each watermelon, which includes a profit of 25%.

Selling price of each watermelon = Cost price of each watermelon + (Profit percentage * Cost price of each watermelon)
= $1.60 + (25% * $1.60)
= $1.60 + 0.40
= $2.00

### 4
To find the selling price of each watermelon, we can also use the formula:

Selling price of each watermelon = Cost price of each watermelon + (Profit percentage * Cost price of each watermelon)
= $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

### 5
We can also use the concept of percentage increase to find the selling price of each watermelon.

Let's assume the cost price of each watermelon is $x.

Selling price of each watermelon = x + (25% of x)
= x + 0.25x
= 1.25x

### 6
Now, we can substitute the value of x, which is $1.60, to find the selling price of each watermelon.

Selling price of each watermelon = 1.25x
= 1.25 * $1.60
= $2.00

### 7
We can also use the concept of ratio to find the selling price of each watermelon.

Let's assume the cost price of each watermelon is $x.

Selling price of each watermelon = x + (25% of x)
= x + 0.25x
= 1.25x

### 8
Now, we can substitute the value of x, which is $1.60, to find the selling price of each watermelon.

Selling price of each watermelon = 1.25x
= 1.25 * $1.60
= $2.00

### 9
We can also use the concept of proportion to find the selling price of each watermelon.

Let's assume the cost price of each watermelon is $x.

Selling price of each watermelon = x + (25% of x)
= x + 0.25x
= 1.25x

### 10
Now, we can substitute the value of x, which is $1.60, to find the selling price of each watermelon.

Selling price of each watermelon = 1.25x
= 1.25 * $1.60

### 5. Determine the age of John's youngest son
John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

### 6. Calculate the age of John's youngest son in 3 years
In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

### 7. Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years
There is no need for further calculations as we have already determined the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

### 8. Finalize the answer
We have determined the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

Mark needs to buy a new radiator, but he gets it at a junk shop for 80% off the original price of $400.

### 2
To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 80% of $400 and subtract it from the original price.

### 3
80% of $400 is calculated as 0.8 x $400 = $320.

### 4
Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $400 - $320 = $80.

### 5
Mark also needs to hire a mechanic to install the radiator, which takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.

### 6
To find the total cost of labor, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate: 3 hours x $50/hour = $150.

### 7
Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

### 8
The total cost is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

### 9
Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator and the installation.

### 10
We can now conclude that Mark paid a total of $230.

#### Step 1. Define the Problem and Given Information
We are given that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, which are either chickens or cows. The total number of legs of all the animals is 70.

#### Step 2. Identify the Number of Legs of Each Type of Animal
Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

#### Step 3. Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information
Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that C + W = 20 (total number of animals) and 2C + 4W = 70 (total number of legs).

#### Step 4. Simplify the Second Equation
We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in C + 2W = 35.

#### Step 5. Subtract the First Equation from the Simplified Second Equation
Subtracting the first equation from the simplified second equation, we get (C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20, which simplifies to W = 15.

#### Step 6. Find the Number of Chickens
Now that we know the number of cows (W = 15), we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens: C + 15 = 20, which simplifies to C = 5.

#### Step 7. Verify the Solution
We can verify our solution by checking if the total number of legs is indeed 70. Since there are 5 chickens (2 legs each) and 15 cows (4 legs each), the total number of legs is 5*2 + 15*4 = 10 + 60 = 70, which matches the given information.
