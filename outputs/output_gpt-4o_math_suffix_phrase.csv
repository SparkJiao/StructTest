0,"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate how many eggs she sells daily.

1. **Total eggs laid per day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs each day.

2. **Eggs used for breakfast:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.

3. **Eggs used for baking:** Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.

4. **Eggs available for sale:** To find out how many eggs are left for sale, we subtract the eggs used for breakfast and baking from the total eggs laid:

   \[
   \text{Eggs available for sale} = \text{Total eggs laid} - \text{Eggs used for breakfast} - \text{Eggs used for baking}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Eggs available for sale} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9
   \]

5. **Income from selling eggs:** Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the income she makes from selling the eggs is:

   \[
   \text{Income} = \text{Eggs available for sale} \times \text{Price per egg}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Income} = 9 \times 2 = 18
   \]

Thus, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

2,"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Investment:**
   Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, his total investment in the house is:
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Increased Value of the House:**
   The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value of the house is 150% more than the original purchase price of $80,000. To find the increased value, we calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original price:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price (new value of the house) and the total investment. Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

4,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens each day and then find out how much feed is left for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed required for all the chickens each day is:

\[
20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to account for the feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. Wendi gives 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement:

\[
60 \text{ cups (total needed)} - 40 \text{ cups (already given)} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. Therefore, the final result is:

1. Henry's total bike trip was 60 miles.
2. He made his first stop after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

Since the total trip is 60 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we can calculate the distance at which the second stop occurred:

\[ \text{Second stop} = 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Let's define:
- \( g \) as the number of gold coins.
- \( s \) as the number of silver coins.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   g + s = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   g = s + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( g \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
(s + 30) + s = 110
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2s + 30 = 110
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2s = 80
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
s = 40

Now that we know \( s = 40 \), we can find \( g \) using the equation \( g = s + 30 \):

\[
g = 40 + 30 = 70

3. At work, she used 1 Post-it note for each of the 220 cups of coffee, so she used a total of 220 Post-it notes.
4. After using the Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Initial Post-it notes + Purchased Post-it notes - Used Post-it notes = Remaining Post-it notes

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Combine like terms: \( 80 + x - 220 = 23 \)
2. Simplify the left side: \( x - 140 = 23 \)
3. Add 140 to both sides to solve for \( x \): \( x = 23 + 140 \)
4. Calculate the result: \( x = 163 \)

Therefore, the package that Candice purchased contained ### 163",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
47,"To determine how much John spent on ties, we need to calculate the number of blue and red ties he bought and their respective costs.

1. **Calculate the number of blue ties:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Calculate the number of red ties:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Calculate the cost of red ties:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Cost of one red tie = Cost of one blue tie + 50% of the cost of one blue tie
   - Cost of one red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total amount spent = Total cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
   - Total amount spent = $200 + $600 = $800

48,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 4-foot long wire.

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we have a total of 48 inches of wire. We want to cut this wire into pieces that are each 6 inches long. To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the original 4-foot wire.

49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:
     \[
     \text{Total units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - We are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - To find the number of occupied units, multiply the total number of units by the fraction that is occupied:
     \[
     \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - To find the number of unoccupied units, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
     \[
     \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units}
     \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

1. **Calculate the weight removed by the comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - If Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed from the comic books is:
     \[
     30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining weight that needs to be removed:**
   - Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds.
   - He has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books.
   - The remaining weight that needs to be removed is:
     \[
     15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys to remove:**
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - To remove 7.5 pounds using toys, we need to find how many toys, \( x \), satisfy:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

We are given that the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16. Each level below has double the square footage of the level above it, since each level above has half the square footage of the level below.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level starting from the top:

1. **4th Level (Top Level):**  
   The square footage is given as 16.

2. **3rd Level:**  
   Since the 4th level has half the square footage of the 3rd level, the 3rd level must have double the square footage of the 4th level.  
   \[
   \text{Square footage of 3rd level} = 2 \times 16 = 32
   \]

3. **2nd Level:**  
   Similarly, the 2nd level has double the square footage of the 3rd level.  
   \[
   \text{Square footage of 2nd level} = 2 \times 32 = 64
   \]

4. **1st Level (Bottom Level):**  
   The 1st level has double the square footage of the 2nd level.  
   \[
   \text{Square footage of 1st level} = 2 \times 64 = 128
   \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- 1st Level: 128
- 2nd Level: 64
- 3rd Level: 32
- 4th Level: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels.

\[
\text{Total square footage} = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
\]

There are 4 levels, so the average square footage is:

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total cups for the first 180 days = 1 cup/day × 180 days = 180 cups.

2. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining days of the year:**
   - There are 365 days in a year, so the remaining days after the first 180 days are 365 - 180 = 185 days.
   - For these 185 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total cups for the remaining 185 days = 2 cups/day × 185 days = 370 cups.

3. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the entire year:**
   - Total cups for the year = cups for the first 180 days + cups for the remaining 185 days

94,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of pet in the neighborhood and then find the total number of pets.

1. **Determine the number of dogs:**
   - We are given that the number of dogs is 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We are told that there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, if there are 60 dogs, the number of cats is:
     \[
     \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. First, we calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
     \[
     \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
     \[
     \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

First, let's find out how many boys are in Grade 5. We know that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:

\[
\text{Girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

Finally, to find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[
\text{Girls not in girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40

96,"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept.

Harry slept for 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of the time Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we multiply the number of hours Harry slept by 2/3:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, James slept for 6 hours.

Next, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference in sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

97,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce, given that the sauce loses half its volume when cooked.

1. **Understanding the Volume Reduction:**
   - When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, the volume is reduced by half. Therefore, if the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice that amount.
   - Initial volume of canned tomatoes = \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Relating Cans to Tomatoes:**
   - Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces and contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many cans were used, we divide the initial volume of canned tomatoes by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Tomatoes:**
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

   \]

3. **Cars Driving Through in the Remaining 15 Minutes**: We know that 20 cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam.

4. **Cars Driving Through in the First 15 Minutes**: Since 25 cars are left to drive through the traffic jam after 5 cars take an exit, and 20 of these drive through in the remaining 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:

   \[
   \text{Cars driving through in the first 15 minutes} = 25 - 20 = 5

- On Monday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode.
- On Tuesday, he watched another 1-hour episode.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. We need to find out how many.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's calculate the total hours of TV he watched from Monday to Friday:

1. Monday: 1 hour
2. Tuesday: 1 hour
3. Wednesday: Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \( x \). Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time for Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Therefore, he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, which means the number of cookies left is \( (2x + 15) - 5 \).

We are told that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 110

115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate both her total cost and her total revenue from selling the lumber, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Calculate the original cost of the lumber:**

   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Total cost for ten boards = 10 boards × $10/board = $100

   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Total cost for five boards = 5 boards × $16/board = $80

   - Total original cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price of the lumber:**

   Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price for each type of board will be 150% of the original cost.

   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Original cost per board = $10
     - Increased cost per board = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15
     - Total selling price for ten boards = 10 boards × $15/board = $150

   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Original cost per board = $16
     - Increased cost per board = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24
     - Total selling price for five boards = 5 boards × $24/board = $120

   - Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

3. **Calculate the profit:**

   Profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total original cost.

   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost

116,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio given and how it relates to the total amount used. Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

Let's denote the number of parts of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of parts of water as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \(x\), divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. Since the sugar is represented by \(7x\), we substitute \(x = 6\) into the expression:

\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

Initially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of vehicles on the first day} = 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, additional containers were imported, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

\[ \text{Number of vehicles added on the second day} = 30 \text{ total vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles from the first day} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day can be calculated by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

\[ \text{Number of containers on the second day} = \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

1. **Adrien's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   - We know Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

2. **Adrien's Salary Now (Four Years Later):**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years.
   - To find the new salary, calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original salary:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.40 \times 40,000 = 16,000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Adrien's Salary Now} = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000

First, let's look at what Morisette brought:
- Morisette brought 5 apples.
- Morisette brought 8 oranges.

Next, let's determine what Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, we calculate the total number of fruits:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps.
   - There is another pile of letters that are already stamped, but we don't know how many are in this pile initially.

2. **Jennie's Action:**
   - Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   - One-third of 60 letters is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
     \]
   - So, Jennie stamps 20 letters.

3. **Final Situation:**
   - After Jennie stamps 20 letters, these 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters.
   - We are told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

4. **Determine the Initial Number of Already-Stamped Letters:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of letters initially in the pile of already-stamped letters.
   - After adding the 20 newly stamped letters, the total number of stamped letters becomes 30.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons left.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia had \( x \) spoons from her package. Her husband added 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons before she used any was:

\[ x + 5 \]

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left after sampling was:

\[ (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 \]

We know that after using the 3 spoons, Julia had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]

\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

1. **Calculate the total number of patient hours per day:**

   Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

   \[
   \text{Time per patient in hours} = \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \text{ hours}

2. **Calculate the revenue from patients:**

   The hospital charges patients $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from patients per day is:

   \[
   \text{Revenue per day} = 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}

**First Test:**
- Total questions: 75
- Rate of completion: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions and he completed 40, the number of incomplete questions is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

**Second Test:**
- Total questions: 100
- Rate of completion: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Next, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions and he completed 30, the number of incomplete questions is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

**Total Incomplete Questions:**
Add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( b \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( p \).

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ p = 4b + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we substitute \( b = 12 \) into the equation:

\[ p = 4(12) + 22 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 12 \):

140,"To determine the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are.

We know the total number of cars is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic cars and 4 are manual cars. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars}
\]

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4

Now, we calculate the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic. The formula for percentage is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}}\right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{4}{20}\right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%

Let's define:
- \( q \) as the number of queen bees.
- \( b \) as the number of baby bees.
- \( w \) as the number of worker bees.

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( w = 2b \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( b = 2q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( q + b + w = 700 \).

We can substitute the expressions for \( b \) and \( w \) in terms of \( q \) into the total equation:

First, substitute \( b = 2q \) into \( w = 2b \):
\[ w = 2(2q) = 4q \]

Now substitute \( b = 2q \) and \( w = 4q \) into the total equation:
\[ q + b + w = 700 \]
\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]
\[ 7q = 700 \]

Solve for \( q \):
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now that we know \( q = 100 \), we can find \( b \) and \( w \):
\[ b = 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ w = 4q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

Let's categorize the items:

- Milk: $2 (food item, no tax)
- Eggs: $3 (food item, no tax)
- Light bulbs: $3 (nonfood item, subject to tax)
- Cups: $3 (nonfood item, subject to tax)
- Roach traps: $4 (nonfood item, subject to tax)

Next, we calculate the tax for each nonfood item:

1. Light bulbs: The cost is $3. The tax is 10% of $3, which is \(0.10 \times 3 = 0.3\) dollars.
2. Cups: The cost is $3. The tax is 10% of $3, which is \(0.10 \times 3 = 0.3\) dollars.
3. Roach traps: The cost is $4. The tax is 10% of $4, which is \(0.10 \times 4 = 0.4\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost before tax = \(2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we add the tax for the nonfood items:

Total tax = \(0.3 + 0.3 + 0.4 = 1\) dollar.

Finally, we add the total tax to the total cost before tax to find the total cost including tax:

Total cost including tax = \(15 + 1 = 16\) dollars.

1 mile = 5280 feet.

**Steve's distance:**
\[ 3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

**Tim's distance:**
\[ 2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

**Steve's time:**
Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. The time it takes for Steve to get home is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} \]

Calculating this:

161,"To determine the total number of fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish Locsin caught and then sum up the totals for both Anakin and Locsin.

First, let's find out how many of each type of fish Locsin caught:

1. **Starfish:**
   - Anakin caught 10 starfish.
   - Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin.
   - Therefore, Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.

2. **Sea horses:**
   - Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
   - Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin.
   - Therefore, Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.

3. **Clownfish:**
   - Anakin caught 3 clownfish.
   - Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin.
   - Therefore, Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught:

- **Anakin's total catch:**
  - Starfish: 10
  - Sea horses: 6
  - Clownfish: 3
  - Total for Anakin = \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\)

- **Locsin's total catch:**
  - Starfish: 5
  - Sea horses: 3
  - Clownfish: 5
  - Total for Locsin = \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)

Finally, we add the totals for Anakin and Locsin to find the total number of fish they caught together:

- Total fish caught by both = \(19 + 13 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of fish Anakin and Locsin were able to catch is:

162,"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the increase rate:**
   - The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
   - The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. This means the increase every two months is \(0.2 \times 20 = 4\) dollars.

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Since each period is two months, the number of periods in 36 months is \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\).

3. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months:**
   - Each period, the price increases by $4. Over 18 periods, the total increase is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the final price:**
   - The final price after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase: \(20 + 72 = 92\) dollars.

1. **Doing Taxes Herself:**
   - If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour from her freelance work.
   - Therefore, the total income she loses by doing the taxes herself is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105

Now, we compare the costs of both options:

- **Cost of Doing Taxes Herself:** $105 (in lost income)
- **Cost of Hiring an Accountant:** $90

By hiring the accountant, Jackie avoids losing $105 in income and only pays $90. Therefore, the difference in cost between doing the taxes herself and hiring the accountant is:

\[
\$105 - \$90 = \$15
\]

Thus, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing the taxes herself.

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:

\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

Substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2B + B = 24 \]

Combine like terms:

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. Billy takes about a minute and a half to peel one potato. A minute and a half is equivalent to 1.5 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 1.5 minutes is equal to:

\[ 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it takes Billy 90 seconds to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. Billy takes about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

First, let's calculate the total revenue they made from selling lemonade. They made $25 in profit. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. 

Let's denote:
- \( G \) as the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
- The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
- The total cost for \( G \) gallons is \( 5G \) dollars.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars per gallon} \]

The total revenue for \( G \) gallons is:
\[ 10G \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Now, we need to calculate how much they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3. Therefore, for 5 gallons, the cost for lemons is:

Let's break down the information given:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
2. She ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

From point 2, we can find the number of white carnations:
- Let the number of white carnations be \( x \).

   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years more than 15, which means \( M - 2 = 15 + 5 \).

3. **Solving for Mark's age:**
   - From the equation \( M - 2 = 20 \), we can solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M - 2 = 20 \\
     M = 20 + 2 \\
     M = 22
     \]

4. **Finding Jean's age:**
   - Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is \( M + 2 = 22 + 2 = 24 \).

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

183,"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team 1 (Well-rounded team):**

Each member of this team runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for Team 1 is:

\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Team 2 (Less well-rounded team):**

The first runner of this team runs their leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for Team 2 is the sum of these times:

\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Calculating the difference:**

To find out how many seconds the faster team (Team 1) will win by, we subtract the total time of Team 1 from the total time of Team 2:

\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}

184,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate two probabilities and then compare them.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**

Now, we compare the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 with the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \(\frac{1}{2}\), and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (\(\frac{1}{4}\)), we calculate:
\[ \left(\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}}\right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

Therefore, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
- Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
- Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 hamsters.
- The rabbits collectively receive 20 pieces of straw.

The total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces. We can set up the equation based on the distribution of straw:

The formula for compound interest is:

\[ A = P \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount owed), which is $100 in this case.
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (expressed as a decimal), which is 2% or 0.02.

3. **Calculate the sum of the highest five scores (after removing the lowest score):**
   \[
   438 - 71 = 367
   \]

4. **Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The sum of the highest five scores including the sixth test will be:**
   \[
   367 + x
   \]

5. **To find the average of these five scores, divide by 5:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465

**First Period:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.

First, calculate the total number of rides in the first period:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ rides} \]

Next, calculate the total distance covered in the first period:
\[ 20 \text{ rides} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

**Second Period:**
- Micheal changed his routine to riding 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \, \text{g} = 1000 \, \text{g} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. We are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is half the weight of a chocolate bar:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \, \text{g}}{2} = 20 \, \text{g} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, so:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \, \text{g} = 1600 \, \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate is sold at $6000, the cost for half a dozen (which is 6 plates) is:

\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of these plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, let's determine how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen equals 12, twenty dozen is:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Thus, there are 240 cups in twenty dozen.

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:

First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\).

Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, so her total savings after babysitting is:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to determine how much more money Sara needs to reach the total cost of $70:
- She needs $70 and currently has $30, so she needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40, we divide the amount needed by the amount she earns per mowing:

211,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs each per day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each per day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs produced per day as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Additionally, we know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This gives us another equation:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)
2. \( w = r + 2 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the first equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

3. **Third Day:**
   We know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day can be found by subtracting the number of customers from the first two days from the total:

- Let \( x \) be the amount of water (in gallons) in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Then, the big pool had \( 2x \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago, since it had twice as much water as the small pool.

Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, in 4 minutes, each pool would have lost:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

\[ x - 16 \]

And the amount of water in the big pool now is:

\[ 2x - 16 \]

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

1. Expand the right side:

   \[ 2x - 16 = 4x - 64 \]

2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) on one side:

   \[ 2x - 4x = -64 + 16 \]

3. Simplify:

   \[ -2x = -48 \]

4. Divide both sides by -2:

   \[ x = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Now, the small pool has:

\[ x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is 8 gallons.

First, we account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is \(40 - 8 = 32\).
- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is \(20 + 14 = 34\).

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can place:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Together, Kalinda and her mom can place:

\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle at this combined rate. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[
\frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since we want to know the time in hours, we convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
\frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.

2. **First visit (after two months)**:
   - Ashlyn found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Calculate 30% of 120: 
     \[
     0.30 \times 120 = 36
     \]
   - Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons, which means:
     \[
     120 - 36 = 84
     \]
     watermelons were left on the farm.

3. **Second visit (two weeks later)**:
   - 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Calculate 3/4 of 84:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63

Let's calculate how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens:

1. From the 25 empty pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]

Now, Ram has 5 new pens. After using these 5 pens, he will have 5 more empty pens. He can again combine the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 more new pen:

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( R \) be the number of candies Robert has.
- According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, \( J = 2R \).
- We are given that John has 54 candies, so \( J = 54 \).

From the equation \( J = 2R \), we substitute \( J = 54 \) to find \( R \):
\[
54 = 2R

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. The problem states that James has 6 more candies than Robert:
\[
\text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
\]

Finally, we need to find how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies:

1. **Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide:**
   - Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel.
   - To find 30% of Mitchel's 30 times: 
     \[
     30 \times 0.30 = 9

278,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how the sum of Mico's and Marco's ages changes over time.

Currently, the sum of their ages is 20. Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ M + N = 20 \]

We are asked to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( N + 10 \).

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (N + 10) = M + N + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem that \( M + N = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + N + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expand the right side of the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( S \):
\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

First, let's calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 stars and the rows of 6 stars:

1. **Rows of 8 stars:**
   - There are 3 rows, each with 8 stars.
   - Total stars from these rows = \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.

2. **Rows of 6 stars:**
   - There are 2 rows, each with 6 stars.

First, let's find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**

   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice for both lunch and dinner. Therefore, the total rice consumption per meal is:

   \[
   \text{Rice per meal} = 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg}
   \]

   Since they eat rice for both lunch and dinner, the total daily rice consumption is:

   \[
   \text{Daily rice consumption} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}

299,"To calculate how much John pays for the driving service each year, we need to consider both the cost per mile and the monthly bonus he gives to the driver.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**
   - John travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, totaling 60 miles per day.
   - He works 5 days a week, so he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles per week.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles per year.

2. **Calculate the cost per mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile.
   - Therefore, the cost for the miles driven per year is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

3. **Calculate the total bonus per year:**
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus per year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

4. **Calculate the total cost per year:**
   - Add the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

301,"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand how the pages are arranged on each piece of paper.

A tabloid is typically made by folding large sheets of paper in half. Each sheet of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages of the tabloid. Here's how it works:

1. Each piece of paper has two sides, and when folded, it creates 4 pages:
   - The front side of the folded paper has two pages (e.g., pages 2 and 31).
   - The back side of the folded paper also has two pages (e.g., pages 1 and 32).

2. Therefore, each sheet of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid.

3. To find out how many sheets of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each sheet contributes:

   \[
   \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

Thus, 8 pieces of paper are required to create a 32-page tabloid.

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks.

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

To find out the total amount she spent, we add the amount spent on food and snacks to the amount spent on rides:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Annika spent a total of $35 at the fair.

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:

303,"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year.

First, let's establish the total number of books sold over the three years. Elise started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books. Therefore, she has sold:

\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books} \]

Next, we know that she sold 45 books in the current year (the third year). Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as \( x \). According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore:

\[ x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books} \]

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year. Since the total number of books sold over the three years is 200, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + \text{books sold in the second year} + 45 = 200 \]

Substituting the value of \( x \):

\[ 90 + \text{books sold in the second year} + 45 = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 135 + \text{books sold in the second year} = 200 \]

\[ \text{books sold in the second year} = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

Elise sold 65 books in the second year. Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:

1. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours per day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, he works \(10 \times 5 = 50\) hours per week.
   - Watson earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
     \[
     50 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 500 \, \text{dollars/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Since the company performed very well for the whole month, he receives this bonus every week.

3. **Calculate Watson's total weekly earnings:**
   - His total weekly earnings are the sum of his earnings from his hourly wage and his bonus:
     \[
     500 \, \text{dollars/week} + 300 \, \text{dollars/week} = 800 \, \text{dollars/week}

First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, the amount of weight Joey loses per week is:

\[
\text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Next, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take her to lose 8 pounds:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ weeks}}

   - Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
   - Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \).

2. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \).

3. **Relate Noah's age to Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.

322,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pencils are in each box and then calculate the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have.

First, let's find out how many pencils are in each box. Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3b + 2 = 26 \]

where \( b \) represents the number of pencils in each box. Solving for \( b \):

1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

   \[ 3b = 24 \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:

   \[ b = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils, given that each box holds 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

First, let's calculate the effect of the ice cubes:

1. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
2. Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
3. To find out how many ice cubes are needed, divide the total cooling needed by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65}{13} = 5
   \]

4. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
5. Therefore, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:
   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Next, consider the effect of the added cream:

1. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
2. Any added liquid, including cream, weakens the coffee by the amount added.
3. Therefore, the weakening effect from the cream is:
   \[
   \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Finally, add the weakening effects from both the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening of the coffee:

\[
\text{Total weakening} = 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters}

3. **Customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale:**  
   Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.  
   Therefore, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**  
   We know the total number of people kicked out is 50.  
   Let \( y \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons.  
   The equation for the total number of people kicked out is:  
   \[
   x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50

368,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.
2. Sara scored 8 points.
3. Therefore, Erin's points after scoring 14 can be expressed as 3 times Sara's points.

Let's denote Erin's points after scoring 14 as \( E \).

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can write:
\[ E = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin has 24 points after scoring 14.

Now, we need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14.

Let \( x \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring 14.

After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points are:
\[ x + 14 = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x + 14 = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 14 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14.

Mary has 30 sheep in total. She gets milk from half of them at a rate of 1 kg per sheep, and from the other half at a rate of 2 kg per sheep.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half:

- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

So, Mary has 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each, and 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each.

Now, calculate the total milk from each group:

1. For the 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg of milk}

\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial loan),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

First, we need to convert the time from months to years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 months is:

\[
t = \frac{5}{12} \text{ years}
\]

The principal amount \( P \) is $3,650, and the annual interest rate \( r \) is 10%, or 0.10 as a decimal.

Now, calculate the interest:

\[
I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

\[
I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167
\]

\[
I = 3650 \times 0.04167

392,"To determine how much money Tim saves by canceling his cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of his new streaming services and compare it to his previous cable package cost.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:**
   - Normally, Hulu costs $10 per month and Disney Plus costs $10 per month.
   - However, Tim saves 20% by bundling these two services.
   - The combined normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - The savings from bundling is 20% of $20, which is \(0.20 \times 20 = 4\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the bundled cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services:**
   - The total monthly cost for all streaming services is the sum of Netflix and the bundled Hulu and Disney Plus:
   \[
   10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

4. **Savings from canceling cable:**
   - Tim's cable package costs $60 per month.
   - By switching to streaming services, he spends $26 per month.
   - Therefore, the savings per month is:
   \[
   60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

Thus, Tim saves $34 per month by canceling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

1. **Time spent writing the song:**  
   Carol spends 4 hours writing the song.

2. **Time spent recording the song:**  
   She spends half the time recording as she does writing.  
   \[
   \text{Time spent recording} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Time spent editing the song:**  
   She spends 90 minutes editing. We need to convert this to hours for consistency.  
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total work time:**  
   Add up all the time spent on each activity.  
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours (writing)} + 2 \text{ hours (recording)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (editing)} = 7.5 \text{ hours}

394,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. Therefore, the total number of slots available in the shelving system is calculated by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns:

   \[
   6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of books Wendy wants to place**: Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Let's denote the number of books she initially considers as \( x \).

   - Double the number of books is \( 2x \).
   - Adding 20 more books gives us \( 2x + 20 \).

3. **Equating to the total slots**: Since Wendy wants to fill the entire shelving system, the total number of books she wants to place must equal the total number of slots available:

   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**: We solve the equation to find the value of \( x \).

   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

   Subtract 20 from both sides:

   \[
   2x = 16
   \]

   Divide both sides by 2:

   \[
   x = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of books**: Now that we know \( x = 8 \), we can find the total number of books Wendy wants to place:

   \[
   2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

Thus, Wendy needs to carry a total of 36 books to complete her task.

- Each employee worked a 40-hour workweek.
- The hourly wage for each employee was $15.

First, calculate the weekly earnings for one employee:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings per employee} = 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Next, calculate the total payment for all employees in May:

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
- Therefore, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ \text{Remaining employees} = 40 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40\right) = 40 - 10 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Each of these 30 employees also worked a 40-hour workweek at $15 per hour.

Calculate the weekly earnings for one employee in June (same as May):

412,"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies per night, we can calculate the total number of cookies needed as follows:

\[ 
2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} 
\]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies this equates to. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12 to find the number of dozens:

\[ 
\frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} 
\]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

413,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles both explode and smell like wet dog.

First, let's understand the probabilities given:

1. Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles do explode. Therefore, the probability of a candle exploding is 1%.

2. Of the candles that explode, 5% also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Now, let's calculate the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog:

1. Calculate the number of candles that explode:
   - Total candles = 50,000
   - Probability of a candle exploding = 1% = 0.01
   - Number of exploding candles = 50,000 * 0.01 = 500

2. Calculate the number of exploding candles that also smell like wet dog:
   - Probability of an exploding candle smelling like wet dog = 5% = 0.05
   - Number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog = 500 * 0.05 = 25

Therefore, 25 of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

Now, let's consider her sister's contribution:

1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. Her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[

416,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals (heads) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (bumps) is 304.

We can translate these into equations:
1. The total number of heads (animals) is given by:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is given by:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]
   This is because each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump.

Now, we have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
c + d &= 180 \\
2c + d &= 304
\end{align*}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
c + d = 180
\]
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is 56.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Distance for the first 4 days = 4 days × 200 km/day = 800 km.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance covered in the first 4 days = 800 km.
   - 30% of 800 km = 0.30 × 800 km = 240 km.
   - Distance for the next 2 days = 240 km.

3. **Next day (7th day):**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance for this day = 0 km.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Distance for the second week = 7 days × 300 km/day = 2100 km.

Now, we sum up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip:

- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the 7th day + Distance for the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

1. **Understanding the relationships:**
   - Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker.
   - Peter's locker is given to be 5 cubic inches.

2. **Expressing the relationships mathematically:**
   - Let \( T \) be the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches.
   - Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, the size of Zack's locker, \( Z \), is:
     \[
     Z = \frac{1}{2}T
     \]
   - Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) the size of Zack's locker, so the size of Peter's locker, \( P \), is:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4}Z
     \]
   - We know that \( P = 5 \) cubic inches.

3. **Substituting the known value:**
   - Substitute \( Z = \frac{1}{2}T \) into the equation for \( P \):
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{1}{2}T\right) = \frac{1}{8}T

1. **First 6 months at the introductory rate:**
   - Cost per month = $8
   - Total cost for 6 months = 6 months × $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at the normal rate:**
   - Cost per month = $12
   - Total cost for 8 months = 8 months × $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining months at the increased rate:**
   - Total duration of the service = 2 years = 24 months
   - Months already accounted for = 6 months (introductory) + 8 months (normal) = 14 months
   - Remaining months = 24 months - 14 months = 10 months

3. He had 1% of his money left after his purchases.

First, calculate the total cost of the chips:
- Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.
- George bought 3 bags of chips.

Total cost of chips = 3 bags × 40 cents/bag = 120 cents.

Next, calculate how much money George had left after spending on chips:
- George spent $5 in total, which is 500 cents (since $1 = 100 cents).
- He had 1% of his money left after his purchases.

1% of $5 is:
1% of 500 cents = 0.01 × 500 = 5 cents.

This means George had 5 cents left after buying chips and candy bars.

Now, calculate how much money he spent on candy bars:
- Total money spent = 500 cents.
- Money left = 5 cents.

Money spent on chips and candy bars = Total money spent - Money left
= 500 cents - 5 cents
= 495 cents.

We already know he spent 120 cents on chips, so the money spent on candy bars is:
Money spent on candy bars = Total money spent on chips and candy bars - Money spent on chips
= 495 cents - 120 cents
= 375 cents.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, divide the total money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
Number of candy bars = Money spent on candy bars / Cost per candy bar
= 375 cents / 75 cents/bar
= 5 bars.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

   - The farmer buys two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - The farmer buys four 12-pound bags of carrots.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - The farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales of hay.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees. The company divided its employees into 3 groups, with each group consisting of 200 employees. Therefore, the total number of employees is:

\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees per group} = 600 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of tour guides. Each group of employees is assigned 7 tour guides. Therefore, the total number of tour guides is:

\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides per group} = 21 \text{ tour guides} \]

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found,
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found,
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   D = \frac{B}{2}
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

Substitute \( L = D + 7 \) into equation 1:
\[
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
\]

Simplify this equation:
\[
2D + B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
2D + B = 36
\]

Now, substitute \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) into the equation \( 2D + B = 36 \):
\[
2\left(\frac{B}{2}\right) + B = 36
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
B + B = 36
\]

Which further simplifies to:
\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we know \( B = 18 \), we can find \( D \) using \( D = \frac{B}{2} \):
\[
D = \frac{18}{2} = 9

Finally, we find \( L \) using \( L = D + 7 \):
\[
L = 9 + 7 = 16

504,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total: two packs of strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum, and one pack of green apple gum.

2. She paid $2 for the grape gum.

3. She paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum. Since the grape gum cost $2, the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

4. The total amount she spent on all the gum was $7.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the grape and green apple gum:

- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1

Total for grape and green apple gum = $2 + $1 = $3

Since she spent $7 in total, the amount spent on the strawberry gum is:

Total spent - Cost of grape and green apple gum = $7 - $3 = $4

She bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the cost per pack of strawberry gum is:

Cost of two packs of strawberry gum / Number of packs = $4 / 2 = $2

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

505,"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and yield of each type of wood.

1. **Cost and Yield Analysis:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

2. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - For a 2 x 4: $4 for 200 sticks means $4/200 = $0.02 per stick.
   - For a 2 x 8: $6 for 400 sticks means $6/400 = $0.015 per stick.

The 2 x 8 is more cost-effective because it costs less per stick.

3. **Budget Allocation:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.
   - If he buys only 2 x 8 pieces, each costing $6, he can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces.

First, let's analyze the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Therefore, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
3. The zoo has 20 sheep.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Therefore, the farm has \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at each location:

- At the farm:
  - Cows: 30
  - Sheep: 10
  - Total animals at the farm = 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals

- At the zoo:
  - Cows: 60
  - Sheep: 20
  - Total animals at the zoo = 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Finally, we add the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo to find the combined total:

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
- Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of onions Rose bought is 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought:
   \[
   4x = 12
   \]

2. The total number of potatoes Rose bought is 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
   \[
   4y = 4
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

For the onions:
\[
4x = 12
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

For the potatoes:
\[
4y = 4
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
y = \frac{4}{4} = 1

Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot. Therefore, the cost of the house can be expressed as \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we combine like terms:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]

\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:

\[ \text{Cost of the house} = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

526,"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate her total electricity consumption and cost in both scenarios.

**Before adding the new device:**

1. Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50.
3. Her daily cost is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 12 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18
   \]
4. To find her weekly cost, multiply the daily cost by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost before} = \$18 \times 7 = \$126
   \]

**After adding the new device:**

1. The new device consumes an additional 2 kilowatts per hour.
2. Ada's new daily consumption becomes:
   \[
   12 \, \text{kWh} + 2 \, \text{kWh} = 14 \, \text{kWh}
   \]
3. Her new daily cost is:
   \[
   \text{New daily cost} = 14 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21
   \]
4. To find her new weekly cost, multiply the new daily cost by 7:
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost after} = \$21 \times 7 = \$147
   \]

**Difference in weekly electric bill:**

1. Calculate the difference between the new weekly cost and the old weekly cost:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \$147 - \$126 = \$21

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since it takes twice as long to paint a whole house as it does to paint half a house).

2. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, one person would take \(10 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 240 \text{ hours}\) to paint a whole house.

3. **Determine the rate for 5 people:**
   - If one person takes 240 hours to paint a whole house, 5 people working together would take \( \frac{240 \text{ hours}}{5} = 48 \text{ hours} \).

Thus, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
- Let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).

Substituting the value of \( S_O \) into the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Next, we know:
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Total sofas: \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \)

Finally, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

First, let's determine the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. We know there are 8 weeks in total, and we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for different durations:

1. He worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
2. He worked out for 6 hours in one week.

These account for 3 weeks (2 weeks at 5 hours each and 1 week at 6 hours). Therefore, the remaining weeks where he worked out for 4 hours each are:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we calculate the total hours for each scenario:

1. **Weeks with 4 hours of workout:**
   \[
   5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}

2. **First stop:**  
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.  
   - Therefore, the number of passengers remaining on the bus is:  
     \( 48 - 8 = 40 \) passengers.  
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.  
     Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:

First, let's break down the month of April. April has 30 days. We can divide these 30 days into two halves:
- The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15).
- The second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16 to April 30).

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day during the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first half of the month, he saves a total of:
\[

In the second half of the month, Elvis saves twice as much each day as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day during the second half. Thus, in the second half of the month, he saves a total of:
\[
15 \times 2x = 30x
\]

The total savings for the entire month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[
15x + 30x = 45x
\]

We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 45:
\[
x = \frac{1125}{45}

Calculating the division:
\[
x = 25
\]

Thus, Elvis saves $25 each day during the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much each day during the second half, the amount he saves each day in the second half is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 25 = 50

549,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has.

First, let's understand the situation:

1. James's play set has 80 toys.
2. Jonathan wants a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.

To find out how many toys Jonathan needs for his play set, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

So, Jonathan needs 400 toys to have a play set five times larger than James's.

However, we know that Jonathan is sad because he needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this number. This means that the number of toys Jonathan currently has is 2 less than 400.

Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \).

According to the problem:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

550,"To determine how much Daniel has to spend, we first calculate the total cost of each type of item before any discounts, and then apply the discount to the total.

1. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 notebooks × $1.50/notebook = $7.50.

2. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 2 pens.
   - Each pen costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for pens = 2 pens × $0.25/pen = $0.50.

3. **Cost of Calculator:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 calculator.
   - Each calculator costs $12.
   - Total cost for calculator = 1 calculator × $12/calculator = $12.00.

4. **Cost of Geometry Set:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 geometry set.
   - Each geometry set costs $10.
   - Total cost for geometry set = 1 geometry set × $10/geometry set = $10.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost of all items before the discount:

- Total cost before discount = $7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $12.00 (calculator) + $10.00 (geometry set) = $30.00.

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

- Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 × $30.00 = $3.00.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount Daniel has to spend:

- Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \), and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when set to 450 degrees.
2. The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
3. The percentage error is calculated as the difference divided by the set temperature, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100
   \]

   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

The oven is off by 4%.

Now, we need to find the set temperature for a recipe that requires 520 degrees, considering the same 4% error:

1. Let \( x \) be the set temperature that results in an actual temperature of 520 degrees.
2. The actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature, so:

   \[
   520 = x + 0.04x
   \]

   \[
   520 = 1.04x
   \]

3. Solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{520}{1.04}

592,"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing the boots from each platform, including the shipping costs.

First, let's calculate the total cost on Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we compare the total costs:
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The total cost on eBay is $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
- $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay than on Amazon.

593,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed 20 feet in height, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles in height each day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
2. **Doubling Each Day**: Each day, the beanstalk doubles its height.

We need to find the smallest number of days, \( n \), such that the height of the beanstalk is greater than 20 feet.

The height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as:
\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We want to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

To solve for \( n \), we first divide both sides of the inequality by 4:
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Now, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) for which \( 2^n > 5 \).

Let's calculate the powers of 2:
- \( 2^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)

We see that \( 2^3 = 8 \), which is greater than 5. Therefore, \( n = 3 \) is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality \( 2^n > 5 \).

Thus, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to grow taller than Mark's window.

1. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - We know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms daily.
   - Therefore, the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}

1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years.

2. **Setting up the equation**: 
   - Let \( x \) be Jerry's age 5 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jerry's current age is \( 2x \) (since he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago).

3. **Relating Jerry's age 5 years ago to his current age**:
   - 5 years ago, Jerry was \( x \) years old.
   - Now, Jerry is \( 2x \) years old.

4. **Finding Jerry's current age**:
   - Since Jerry's current age is \( 2x \), we need to express this in terms of his age 5 years ago.
   - 5 years ago, Jerry was \( x \) years old, so now he is \( x + 5 \) years older.
   - Therefore, \( 2x = x + 5 \).

5. **Solving the equation**:
   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides: \( 2x - x = x + 5 - x \).
   - Simplify: \( x = 5 \).

6. **Finding Jerry's current age**:
   - Since \( x = 5 \), Jerry's age 5 years ago was 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jerry's current age is \( 2x = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

7. **Finding Jerry's age in 3 years**:
   - Jerry's current age is 10 years.
   - In 3 years, Jerry will be \( 10 + 3 = 13 \) years old.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Now that we have the smallest angle, \( x = 30 \) degrees, we can find the other angles:

- The angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat consumed by each player:

- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces
- Fourth player: 0 ounces
- Fifth player: 0 ounces

Total ounces of meat consumed = \(6 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 0 = 30\) ounces.

   - We are given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

2. **Price of the Gold Jewel:**
   - The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - Therefore, the price of the gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \).
   - Calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \).
   - So, the price of the gold jewel is $1600.

3. **Price of the Silver Jewel:**
   - The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: $60
2. **Total Number of Classes**: 10

The cost per class is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of classes attended. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny attends. Then the cost per class is:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{x}
\]

We need this cost per class to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10x
\]

Divide both sides by 10:

\[
6 \leq x
\]

This inequality tells us that Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at $10 or less. Therefore, he can miss:

637,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Lynn ran based on the information given about Reggie and Paisley's running distances.

1. **Determine Reggie's running distance:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Therefore, Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

2. **Relate Reggie's and Lynn's running distances:**
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means if Lynn ran \(x\) miles, then Reggie ran \(x + 3\) miles.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - From step 1, we know Reggie ran 20 miles.
   - From step 2, we have the equation \(x + 3 = 20\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate \(x\):
     \[
     x + 3 - 3 = 20 - 3

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

For Bob's hole, the dimensions are:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig out this volume of earth. We know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds to dig the entire hole is:

\[ T = \text{Volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture, which consists of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound of almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts.

1. The cost of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound of almonds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
   \]

2. The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts:
   \[
   \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
   \]

3. Total cost of the first mixture:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of first mixture} = 5 + 5 = 10
   \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture, which consists of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound of almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts.

1. The cost of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound of almonds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2
   \]

2. The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts:
   \[
   \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
   \]

3. Total cost of the second mixture:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of second mixture} = 2 + 5 = 7
   \]

Finally, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 10 - 7 = 3

660,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads is the sum of the sheep and geese:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs each, and geese have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, solve for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the second equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
\]
\[
2s + 40 = 70
\]
\[
2s = 70 - 40
\]
\[
2s = 30
\]
\[
s = 15
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

   - Christina had twelve good days, eight bad days, and the rest were neutral over the past thirty days.
   - Since there are 30 days in total, and 12 were good and 8 were bad, the remaining days must be neutral.
   - Calculation for neutral days: \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) neutral days.

2. **Mood Distribution by Periods:**

First, we need to convert the current height from feet to inches because the growth rate and the target height are both given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The current height of the bamboo is 240 inches.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[
x + 0.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
1.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
1.5x = 120
\]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{120}{1.5}
\]

Calculating the division:

\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final result:

\[
\text{Result: } 80

683,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Chris to mow his lawn when he uses both ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode for half of the lawn each.

First, let's understand the rates at which Chris mows the lawn in each mode:

1. In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour. This means his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is 1 lawn per hour.

2. In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. To convert this to hours, we note that 40 minutes is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of an hour. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is 1 lawn per \(\frac{2}{3}\) hour, which is equivalent to \(\frac{3}{2}\) lawns per hour.

Now, Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Let's calculate the time taken for each half:

- **Turtle Mode:**
  - Since Chris mows the entire lawn in 1 hour in turtle mode, he will mow half the lawn in half the time.
  - Time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \text{ hour} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour}\).

- **Rabbit Mode:**
  - Since Chris mows the entire lawn in \(\frac{2}{3}\) hour in rabbit mode, he will mow half the lawn in half the time.
  - Time taken to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ hour} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}\).

Now, we add the time taken in both modes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} + \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 2 and 3 is 6.

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hour}
\]

Finally, we convert \(\frac{5}{6}\) hour to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes:

\[
\frac{5}{6} \text{ hour} = \frac{5}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.

684,"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and subtract it from the total time they have available.

1. They have 30 minutes in total to walk to school.
2. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
3. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we add the time it takes to get to the library and the fire station:

6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Next, we subtract the time spent walking so far from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time spent so far) = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late.

687,"Let's define the variables:

- Let \( t \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( r \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the problem, we know:

1. There is one set of twins, so there are 2 twins.
2. There is one set of triplets, so there are 3 triplets.
3. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( t = r + 7 \).
4. The combined ages of all the twins and triplets is 44: \( 2t + 3r = 44 \).

We have two equations:

1. \( t = r + 7 \)
2. \( 2t + 3r = 44 \)

Substitute the expression for \( t \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(r + 7) + 3r = 44 \]

Expand and simplify:

\[ 2r + 14 + 3r = 44 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5r + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 5r = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ r = 6 \]

Now that we have \( r = 6 \), substitute back to find \( t \):

\[ t = r + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is 13.

First, we add up the time for all his homework:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes (math)} + 40 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 20 \text{ minutes (history)} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert these hours into minutes to make the units consistent. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on homework from the total time available before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

First, let's find the total cost of the five lollipops that Manolo bought. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost for five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40/\text{lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Manolo spent a total of $3.20 on five lollipops and four candies. Therefore, the cost of the four candies is:

\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30/\text{candy} \]

First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John’s dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( x \) be the total bill. The cost of the heartworm check is then \( 0.6x \).

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:

\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]

\[ 0.4x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much money he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

705,"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the turtle's speed.

We know that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. The cat's speed is given as 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}

706,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the fundraising goal of $6300, given that the firefighters have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours.

First, let's calculate the rate at which the firefighters are raising money per hour. They have raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the rate of fundraising per hour is:

\[
\text{Rate per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more dollars are needed to reach the goal of $6300. Since they have already raised $2100, the remaining amount needed is:

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many additional hours are required to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour. We can find this by dividing the remaining amount by the rate per hour:

\[
\text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, to find the total number of hours required to reach the goal, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional 6 hours:

   Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of the city's water used for industrial purposes:**
   80% of the water that Colorado City uses is for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the city's water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   If 80% is used for industrial purposes, then the remaining 20% is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate how many quarts of each type of ice cream can be made in 48 hours:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Start by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 9x = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9x = 90 \]

Next, divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\).

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\).

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\).

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-fourths of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\).

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Windows smashed from students' cars: 64
- Windows smashed from teachers' cars: 48
- Total windows smashed: \(64 + 48 = 112\)

Initially, we have 54 students who are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size. To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \text{Size of each group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means each group has 9 students. Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to determine how many more groups are needed.

Currently, there are 6 groups. The activity requires 12 groups, so we calculate the difference:

750,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends over two 4-week months.

First, let's determine the number of weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month. A week consists of 7 days, with 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

For one 4-week month:
- Number of weekdays = 4 weeks × 5 weekdays/week = 20 weekdays
- Number of weekend days = 4 weeks × 2 weekend days/week = 8 weekend days

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays = 60 chairs/day × 20 weekdays = 1,200 chairs
- Chairs rented during weekends = 100 chairs/day × 8 weekend days = 800 chairs

Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = 1,200 chairs (weekdays) + 800 chairs (weekends) = 2,000 chairs

Since we need to find the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one month by 2:
Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2,000 chairs/month × 2 months = 4,000 chairs

1. **Calculate the total annual electricity bill:**
   - The monthly electricity bill is $100.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total annual electricity bill is calculated as follows:
     \[
     100 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 1200 \, \text{dollars/year}

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses Jeff sent to the event. He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12 items, we have:

\[
8 \text{ dozen glasses} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of plates Jeff sent to the event. He sent 4 dozen plates, so:

\[

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers.
   - Therefore, 27 small stickers can be traded for 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button.
   - Therefore, 20 large stickers can be traded for 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.
   - Therefore, 20 large stickers can be traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Converting Everything to Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - She has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - She has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - She also has 3 small stickers left, which can be traded for 3 small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 60 (from large stickers) + 3 (from remaining small stickers) = 63 small buttons.

8. **Converting Large Buttons to Small Buttons:**
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons.
   - Therefore, 29 large buttons are worth 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons.

9. **Total Small Buttons:**
   - Total small buttons = 87 (from large buttons) + 63 (small buttons) = 150 small buttons.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.
- \( y \) as the number of votes against the new regulation.

According to the problem, the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against. This gives us the equation:
\[
x = 2y
\]

Additionally, we know that the total number of council members is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against must equal 33:
\[
x + y = 33
\]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( x = 2y \)
2. \( x + y = 33 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2y + y = 33
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
3y = 33
\]

To find \( y \), divide both sides by 3:
\[
y = \frac{33}{3} = 11
\]

Now that we have \( y = 11 \), we can find \( x \) using the first equation \( x = 2y \):

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of cases needed for the first house,
- \( y \) as the number of cases needed for the second house,
- \( z \) as the number of cases needed for the third house.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The first house needs half as many cases as the second house: \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \).
2. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house: \( z = 2x \).
3. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250: \( x + y + z = 250 \).

We can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) into the total equation:

1. Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into \( z = 2x \):
   \[
   z = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right) = y
   \]

2. Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) and \( z = y \) into the total equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = 250
   \]

3. Combine the terms:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}y + y + y = \frac{1}{2}y + 2y = \frac{1}{2}y + \frac{4}{2}y = \frac{5}{2}y
   \]

4. Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   \frac{5}{2}y = 250

   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   5y = 500

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Based on the problem:
- Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level with \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

The scoring system is as follows:
- 10 points per enemy jumped on.
- 5 points per berry collected.
- 30 points per second left on the timer.

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

**Emma's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times B \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times T \)

Emma's total score is:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

**Ava's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

Ava's total score is:
\[ 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]

Simplifying Ava's score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Now, we find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:

1. Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding these fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's define some variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- Let \( y \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- \( x + y = 17 \) (since he bought 17 fish in total).

After adding the fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + x \), and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. From \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[ x = 17 - y \]

2. Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):
   \[ 3 + (17 - y) = 2(4 + y) \]
   \[ 20 - y = 8 + 2y \]

3. Solve for \( y \):
   \[ 20 - 8 = 2y + y \]
   \[ 12 = 3y \]
   \[ y = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

793,"To determine how much Jamie was paid for her work last Tuesday, we need to calculate her earnings for both her regular hours and her additional hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   Jamie works 8 regular hours each day at a rate of $20 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for the regular hours are calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Regular earnings} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160
   \]

2. **Additional Hours:**
   Last Tuesday, Jamie worked a total of 11 hours. This means she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8-hour workday (11 total hours - 8 regular hours = 3 additional hours).

3. **Special Hourly Rate:**
   Jamie's special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this rate, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Special hourly rate} = 150\% \times \$20/\text{hour} = 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour}
   \]

4. **Earnings for Additional Hours:**
   Jamie worked 3 additional hours at the special rate of $30 per hour. Her earnings for these additional hours are:
   \[
   \text{Additional earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90
   \]

5. **Total Earnings:**
   To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we add her regular earnings and her additional earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200

2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20

3. **Salary per employee per month**: $4000

Let's calculate the number of employees at the end of each month:

- **Month 1**: 
  - Initial employees = 200
  - New employees hired = 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 1 = 200 + 20 = 220

- **Month 2**:

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals.

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying these goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation is:

814,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quarters each person uses during the 4 hours of play and then sum up the total.

First, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:

1. **Jack**: 
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 240 minutes, the number of quarters Jack uses is:
   \[
   \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ quarters}
   \]

2. **Two friends who are worse**:
   - Each of these friends can play for half as long as Jack with 1 quarter, which means they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - In 240 minutes, the number of quarters each of these friends uses is:
   \[
   \frac{240}{10} = 24 \text{ quarters}
   \]
   - Since there are two friends, the total number of quarters used by these two friends is:
   \[
   2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ quarters}
   \]

3. **One friend who is better**:
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack with 1 quarter, which means they can play for \( 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - In 240 minutes, the number of quarters this friend uses is:
   \[
   \frac{240}{30} = 8 \text{ quarters}
   \]

Finally, we sum up the quarters used by all four players:
\[
12 \text{ (Jack)} + 48 \text{ (two worse friends)} + 8 \text{ (better friend)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\) quarters.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
815,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( z \) as the amount of citrus zest (in ounces),
- \( f \) as the amount of fragrance (in ounces),
- \( s \) as the amount of salt (in ounces),
- \( o \) as the amount of oil (in ounces),
- \( u \) as the amount of sugar (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance),
2. \( s = u \) (the same amount of salt as sugar),
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt),
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest).

The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + o + u = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
- Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \).
- Since \( s = u \), we can replace \( u \) with \( s \).
- Since \( o = 2s \), we can replace \( o \) with \( 2s \).
- Since \( s = 2z \), we can replace \( s \) with \( 2z \).

Substituting these into the total equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2(2z) + 2z = 10 \]

Simplifying:
\[ 2z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we find \( s \) using \( s = 2z \):
\[ s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Finally, we find \( o \) using \( o = 2s \):
\[ o = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Thus, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

Let's define:
- \( B \) as the number of cards Becca has,
- \( S \) as the number of cards Smendrick has,
- \( P \) as the number of cards PJ has.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of cards is 341:
   \[
   B + S + P = 341
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has:
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) from equations (2) and (3) into equation (1):

Substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Now substitute \( B = 3P + 12 \) and \( S = 3P \) into the total equation:
\[
(3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( P \):
\[
7P = 329
\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[
P = 47

Now that we have \( P = 47 \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):

Calculate \( S \) using \( S = 3P \):
\[
S = 3 \times 47 = 141

Calculate \( B \) using \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 141 + 12 = 153

835,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's establish the relationship between speed, distance, and time. The formula is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Since the kangaroos and turtles are traveling the same distance, we can set up the equation for the kangaroos first:

Let \( v_k \) be the speed of one kangaroo. Then, the distance traveled by the kangaroos is:

\[
\text{Distance} = v_k \times 18
\]

Now, consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle, \( v_t \), is:

\[
v_t = \frac{v_k}{2}
\]

We need to find the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance. Let \( t \) be the time it takes for the turtles. The distance traveled by the turtles is:

\[
\text{Distance} = v_t \times t = \frac{v_k}{2} \times t
\]

Since the distances are the same, we equate the two expressions for distance:

\[
v_k \times 18 = \frac{v_k}{2} \times t
\]

We can cancel \( v_k \) from both sides (assuming \( v_k \neq 0 \)):

\[
18 = \frac{1}{2} \times t
\]

To solve for \( t \), multiply both sides by 2:

\[
t = 36
\]

Thus, it will take the turtles 36 hours to travel the same distance.

837,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Erika already has in her purse.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the new laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the reduced price of the laptop is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs $400 to buy the laptop after the discount.

Next, let's consider the money Erika has received and needs:

1. She was paid $150 from her part-time job.
2. Her mom gave her $80.
3. She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika already has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, should equal the cost of the laptop minus the extra $50 she still needs. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Combine the amounts on the left side:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 230 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]

\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students who are good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students who are good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students who are good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of students good at math only is 5.
- The number of students good at English only is 8.
- The total number of students is 20.

The students who are good at math (\( M \)) include those who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects. Therefore, we can express \( M \) as:

\[
M = \text{(students good at math only)} + \text{(students good at both math and English)}

We are given:
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8

Let \( B \) be the number of students who are good at both math and English. Then:

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the rate of interest per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The rate of interest \( r \) is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, three-quarters of this is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{300} \times 3 \]

Since the rate is given as a dollar amount rather than a percentage, we can directly use it in the calculation:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the simple interest to the original principal:

We will calculate the number of newly infected people each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

**Day 0:**
- Initially infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 new people.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected by the end of Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 new people.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected by the end of Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 new people.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected by the end of Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

863,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of silver coins Gretchen has and then find the total number of coins.

We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. Therefore, we can express the number of gold coins as \( S + 30 \).

We are also told that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ S + 30 = 70 \]

To find the number of silver coins \( S \), we solve the equation:

\[ S + 30 = 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]

\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together:

Number of gold coins = 70

Number of silver coins = 40

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of books Sofie has,
- \( A \) as the number of books Anne has,
- \( F \) as the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books: 
   \[

   Sarah wants to buy a new rope, and the cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter. Since she is replacing the entire 20 meters, the cost of the new rope is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over.**

   To find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she received from selling the old rope:

   \[
   \text{Money left over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 30 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the new rope, Sarah will have $10 left over.

881,"To solve this problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age and then find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is 18 years minus 10 years.
   - Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years.

2. **Find when her age will be thrice her current age:**
   - Melanie's current age is 8 years.
   - We need to find the number of years, \( x \), after which her age will be three times her current age.
   - Three times her current age is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) years.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be 24 years.
   - Her age in \( x \) years will be her current age plus \( x \) years, which is \( 8 + x \).
   - Set up the equation: \( 8 + x = 24 \).

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Subtract 8 from both sides: \( x = 24 - 8 \).
   - \( x = 16 \).

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon costing $10 in total.

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:

- Total cost of bacon = $10
- Total cost of chicken = $24
- Total cost of strawberries = $12
- Total cost of apples = $14

Total cost of all items = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

$65 - $60 = $5.

Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as a usual concert plus a 15-minute encore. Therefore, we can express the total runtime of the final concert as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we need to solve this equation for \( x \).

First, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]

\[ x = 25 \]

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Kamala's lawn was mowed thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- Alba's lawn was mowed five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the payment per mowing session from Joe is \( \frac{6}{x} \).

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Earnings from Joe: \( 6 \) dollars.
- Earnings from Kamala: Since she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times and assuming the same rate per mowing session as Joe, the earnings from Kamala would be \( 3x \times \frac{6}{x} = 18 \) dollars.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:

- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. 
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).

To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one mask by 20:

2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote:

   - Total cost for candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all these expenses:

- Total cost for movies: \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars.
- Total cost for snacks: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.
- Total expenses for the month: \(106 + 24 = 130\) dollars.

Colby receives $150 each month for movies. Therefore, the amount of money he has left is:

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**  
   Rita removed 48 Junebugs.

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**  
   Rita removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

- First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
  \[
  39 + 78 + 78 = 195
  \]

- Next, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
  \[
  195 + 48 = 243
  \]

- Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
  \[
  243 + 57 = 300
  \]

The total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, divide the total number by the number of days (5):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
929,"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours

\[ \text{Distance traveled by the bus} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car.

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours

\[ \text{Distance traveled by the car} = 30 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in distance between the bus and the car:

\[ \text{Difference in distance} = \text{Distance traveled by the bus} - \text{Distance traveled by the car} \]

\[ \text{Difference in distance} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

931,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jean's age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \)
2. \( A = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = A + J \)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( A = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into equation (1):
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( A \) and \( P \):
- \( A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \)
- \( P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, Peter's age is 50.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**

   Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours, and from 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours. Therefore, the total duration of his stay is 12 + 5 = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**

   - The base cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 5 hours beyond the initial 12 hours, Cameron pays 70 pesos per hour.
   - The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Therefore, the total cost using this option is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**

   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

4. **Calculate the savings:**

   - The savings is the difference between the cost of the 24-hour stay and the cost of the 12-hour stay with additional hours.
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for each additional hour after the initial 12 hours, Cameron saves 250 pesos compared to paying for a full 24-hour stay.

3. Marcus is also described as being half of Leo's age. We can express this relationship with the equation:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
   \]

   Substituting Marcus's age from step 2 into this equation gives:
   \[
   21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
   \]

4. To find Leo's age, we solve the equation for Leo's age:
   \[
   \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old.

950,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of points Bahati scored,
- \( A \) as the number of points Azibo scored,
- \( D \) as the number of points Dinar scored.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

Substitute \( B = A + 20 \) into equation 1:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
Simplify:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Substitute \( B = D + 10 \) into equation 1:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's solve for \( D \) in terms of \( A \) from equation 4:
\[
D = 25 - 2A
\]

Substitute \( D = 25 - 2A \) into equation 5:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtract 50 from both sides:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Divide by -3:
\[
A = 5
\]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

951,"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to understand how the thickness of the book relates to the number of pages.

1. **Understanding the Paper and Printing:**
   - The paper used for the book is such that 100 pages stack to make 1 inch of thickness.
   - Each sheet of paper has two sides, and each side is printed with one page of the book.

2. **Calculating the Number of Sheets:**
   - Since 100 pages make up 1 inch, and each sheet has 2 pages (one on each side), there are 50 sheets of paper per inch (because 100 pages / 2 pages per sheet = 50 sheets).

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Sheets in the Book:**
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets in the book is 1.5 inches * 50 sheets per inch = 75 sheets.

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Pages:**
   - Since each sheet has 2 pages, the total number of pages in the book is 75 sheets * 2 pages per sheet = 150 pages.

Thus, the book contains 150 pages.

1. **Calculate the total time spent stapling:**

   Vince starts stapling at 8:00 AM and finishes at 11:00 PM. We need to find the total number of hours between these two times.

   - From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (noon) is 4 hours.
   - From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours.

   Therefore, the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 11 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Convert hours to minutes:**

   Since Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes:
   \[
   15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of 15-minute intervals:**

   Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are there in 900 minutes:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes per interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled:**

   Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. Therefore, the total number of reports he staples is:
   \[
   60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports per interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}

1. **Total Sleep Time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., which is 8 hours. In minutes, this is:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Sleepwalking Time**: Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. To find out how long she was sleepwalking, we calculate the difference:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Waking Up Early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. Normally, she wakes up at 6:00 a.m., but this day she woke up at 5:55 a.m. Therefore, she lost an additional 5 minutes of sleep.

4. **Total Sleep Time on Bed**: Subtract the sleepwalking time and the early wake-up time from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied beds initially is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
     \]
   - This means the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
     \[

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Simplify:
\[

Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
\[
W = 40

Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4W - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13

1. **Emil's Age Now and in the Future:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - When Emil turns 24, we are given two conditions about his dad's and brother's ages.

2. **Condition about Emil's Dad:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let Emil's dad's current age be \( D \).
   - In 5 years (when Emil is 24), Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \).
   - According to the condition: \( 24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \).

3. **Condition about Emil's Brother:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let Emil's brother's current age be \( B \).
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \( B + 5 \).
   - According to the condition: \( 24 = 2(B + 5) \).

Now, let's solve these equations:

**Equation for Emil's Dad:**
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \]
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

**Equation for Emil's Brother:**
\[ 24 = 2(B + 5) \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]

Now we have:
- Emil's dad's current age \( D = 43 \).
- Emil's brother's current age \( B = 7 \).

**Sum of the Ages of Emil's Dad and Brother Now:**

3. **Determine the Time Between Bill's First and Second Sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley appears every 75 years, the time between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, then Bill must have been \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas Bill**: Similarly, Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Therefore, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church Donations**: Buford writes two checks per month for the church. Thus, he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes one check quarterly for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters} = 4 \text{ checks}

993,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of flights the first plane makes in one day and then find out how many of those flights are to France.

First, let's find out how many flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane:

\[ \text{Number of trips by the first plane} = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes 88 trips in one day.

Next, we need to determine how these 88 flights are distributed among the destinations: Greece, France, and Germany.

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[ \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. First, we calculate the number of remaining flights:

\[ \text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22 \]

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \) years
- Alessandro's age: \( B = 4 \) years
- Helene's age: \( H \) years
- Wilfred's age: \( W \) years

We are given that the total age of the children is 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
A + B + H + W = 20
\]

Substituting the known values for Akbar and Alessandro, we have:
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]

Simplifying this equation gives:
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we find:
\[
H + W = 13

We are also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, Helene's age is:
\[
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[
10 + W = 13

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient. Therefore, the total time spent on rounds is:

\[
9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. Doctor Jones has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[
10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[
180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes}

1. **Making the cake batter:** This step takes 20 minutes.

2. **Baking the cake:** This step takes 30 minutes.

3. **Cooling the cake:** This step takes 2 hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

4. **Frosting the cake:** This step takes 10 minutes.

Now, let's add up all these times to find the total time required:

- Making the batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = \(20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours and minutes. Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours (because \(180 \div 60 = 3\)), the entire process takes 3 hours.

To find the latest time Jordan can start, we subtract the total time required from the time the cake needs to be ready:

1. **First Phase of Discharge:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Total loss in the first 5 hours = \( 5 \times 9\% = 45\% \).

2. **Second Phase of Discharge:**
   - For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Total loss in the next 3 hours = \( 3 \times 7\% = 21\% \).

3. **Total Discharge:**
   - Total percentage lost over the 8 hours = \( 45\% + 21\% = 66\% \).

4. **Remaining Charge:**
   - After 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, the initial charge \( x \) minus the total discharge (66%) equals the remaining charge (28%).
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     x - 66\% = 28\%
     \]

5. **Solve for Initial Charge \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to find \( x \):

1. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per hour:**

   Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. Therefore, her total earnings per hour are:

   \[
   10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**

   Janet works 40 hours a week. Therefore, her total earnings per week are:

   - Jamaar bought 3 peaches and 4 pears.
   - Each peach and pear costs $0.5.
   - Total cost for peaches and pears: 
     \[
     (3 + 4) \times 0.5 = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5

3. **Apples:**
   - Jamaar bought 5 apples.
   - Each apple costs $0.75.
   - Total cost for apples: 
     \[
     5 \times 0.75 = 3.75
     \]

Now, we add up the total cost of all the fruits he has purchased:

\[
3.5 \, (\text{peaches and pears}) + 2 \, (\text{kiwis}) + 3.75 \, (\text{apples}) = 9.25

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^n \]

Where:
- The initial price is $120.
- The rate of increase is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal form.
- \( n \) is the number of years, which is 3.

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and distributed them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:

1. **Selfies:**
   - There are 3 albums of selfies.
   - Each album contains 9 pictures.
   - Total selfies = \( 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \)

2. **Portraits:**

1022,"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold as \( x \) and the number of large stuffed animals as \( y \).

According to the problem, each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the total revenue from small stuffed animals is \( 4x \).

Each large stuffed animal is sold for three times the price of a small one, so each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars. Therefore, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is \( 12y \).

The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is $120, so we have the equation:

\[
4x + 12y = 120
\]

Additionally, the problem states that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, which gives us the equation:

\[
x = 2y
\]

Now, we can substitute \( x = 2y \) into the first equation:

\[
4(2y) + 12y = 120
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
8y + 12y = 120
\]

\[
20y = 120
\]

Solving for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Since \( x = 2y \), we substitute \( y = 6 \) back into the equation for \( x \):

\[
x = 2 \times 6 = 12

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present, and in this case, the homework won't be collected. Therefore, there's a 50% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - If the normal teacher is present, which happens with a probability of 50% (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute), we need to consider the following:
     - There's a 40% chance that the teacher will give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance that she won't give an extension.
     - If no class-wide extension is given, Marcus still has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher that his dog ate his homework, resulting in a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher:** 0% (since homework isn't collected with a substitute).
- **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:**
  - Probability that the normal teacher is present: 50%
  - Probability that no class-wide extension is given: 60%
  - Probability that Marcus doesn't get a personal extension: 80%

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework with the normal teacher is calculated by multiplying these probabilities:

1. **Calculate the total loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total Loans} = 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the lost income:**
   Jim was earning $25,000 per year before college. Over 4 years, he loses:
   \[
   \text{Lost Income} = 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost (loans + lost income):**

Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person. Therefore, the share of the second person is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took. Therefore, the share of the third person is \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount divided among the three people:

\[

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
- According to the problem, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. We can set up the following equation to represent this:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve this equation, first combine the terms on the left side:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[
2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The formula to calculate the depreciated value of an asset is given by:

\[
V = P \times (1 - r)^t
\]

where:
- \( V \) is the value of the car after \( t \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

In this problem:
- \( P = 20000 \),
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, let's consider the twin beds. Greg changes sheets on 4 twin beds every week. Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, he will need:

\[
\frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads for twin sheets per week}

According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( x + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for making the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total time:

\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( x \):

\[ 2x = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 40 \]

Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 minutes to Donovan's time:

\[ x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. Therefore, the final result is:

First, let's calculate the cost of butter without the promotion. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, and each pound costs $4.00. Therefore, without any promotion, the total cost would be:

\[ 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$24.00 \]

Now, let's apply the promotion. The promotion is ""buy one, get one half off,"" which means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis pays full price for one pound and half price for the second pound.

1. For the first pair of pounds:
   - Full price for the first pound: $4.00
   - Half price for the second pound: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00
   - Total for the first pair: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

2. For the second pair of pounds:
   - Full price for the third pound: $4.00
   - Half price for the fourth pound: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00
   - Total for the second pair: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

3. For the third pair of pounds:
   - Full price for the fifth pound: $4.00
   - Half price for the sixth pound: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00

1. **First Train:**
   - The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.
   - It stays at the station for 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, it leaves the station 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - The second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting, so the second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Therefore, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - The third train arrives 1 hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting, so the third train arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting, so the fourth train arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Therefore, Paul will wait a total of 145 minutes for his train.

First, let's calculate how many seconds are in 4 hours:

1 hour = 60 minutes  
1 minute = 60 seconds  
Therefore, 1 hour = 60 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds.

So, 4 hours = 4 × 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds.

Now, since each spring creates one jellyfish per second, one spring would create 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Since there are 5 springs, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5:

14400 jellyfish/spring × 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide:

- The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long.
- The sliding speed is 60 feet per minute.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the slide / Speed
\[ \text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide:

- The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long.
- The sliding speed is 80 feet per minute.

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the slide / Speed
\[ \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:

Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.

According to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. This means that the distance Sofie walks is twice the distance Brian walks. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

We already calculated that Sofie will walk 70 miles. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

To find the distance Brian walks, we need to solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

1122,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour.

First, let's calculate how many toys the first four workers produce in total during their 10-hour shift:

1. The first two workers each produce 6 toys per hour. Therefore, in 10 hours, each of these workers produces:
   \[
   6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys}
   \]
   So, together, these two workers produce:
   \[
   60 \text{ toys} + 60 \text{ toys} = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. The next two workers each produce 4 toys per hour. Therefore, in 10 hours, each of these workers produces:
   \[
   4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys}
   \]
   So, together, these two workers produce:
   \[
   40 \text{ toys} + 40 \text{ toys} = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

Adding the toys produced by these four workers, we get:
\[
120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

According to the problem, by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that 380 toys have been produced so far.

Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
\[
380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
\]

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, we can find the number of toys they produce per hour by dividing the total number of toys they produced by the number of hours they worked:
\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
\]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

1. **Determine the number of eggs Camden and Sarah painted:**
   - We know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

   Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \).
   Therefore, Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.

   The equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:
   \[
   S + (S + 12) = 30
   \]

   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2S + 12 = 30
   \]

   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 18
   \]

   Divide by 2:
   \[
   S = 9

- \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces (volume of water from the first mug),
- \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce (volume of water from the second mug).

The total volume of the mixture is \( V_1 + V_2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The condition for Donny to drink the water is that the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is given by the weighted average:

\[
T_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2}
\]

Substituting the known values, we have:

\[
T_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{5}
\]

We need this to be at least 40 degrees:

The ratio of men to women is given as 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can use the ratio to find out how many men and women are on the bus.

First, we find the number of men:
- The number of men is \(\frac{5}{14}\) of the total passengers.
- Number of men = \(\frac{5}{14} \times 84 = 30\).

Next, we find the number of women:
- The number of women is \(\frac{9}{14}\) of the total passengers.
- Number of women = \(\frac{9}{14} \times 84 = 54\).

Now, we know there are initially 54 women on the bus. At the next stop, 20 women alight from the bus.

To find the number of women remaining on the bus, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women:
- Women remaining = 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

1145,"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the sales of individual sunflowers and bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earned $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.

The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of individual sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from individual sunflowers per day}}{\text{Cost per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

The number of bouquets sold per day is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
\[
\text{Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times \text{Number of sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of individual sunflowers sold per day} + \text{Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

First, let's understand the energy coverage provided by one bottle of juice. Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need:

\[ \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles per person} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required for 2300 people. Since each person needs 5 bottles to meet their full daily energy requirement, the total number of bottles needed is:

- Babies wearing purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies wearing blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many babies in each color group are wearing bows:

- All the blue-wearers wear bows, so there are 2 blue-wearing babies with bows.
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers wear bows, so there are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearing babies with bows.

Now, we find the total number of babies wearing bows:

1165,"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then determine his earnings based on the number of collections and the payment per collection.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the first two complexes:**

   Each of the first two apartment complexes has 200 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
   \[
   200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**

   The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined. First, calculate 60% of 400:
   \[
   0.60 \times 400 = 240
   \]
   Therefore, the third complex has:
   \[
   400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**

   Add the apartments from all three complexes:
   \[
   400 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**

   John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
   \[
   1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}
   \]

5. **Calculate John's earnings per week:**

   John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, his total earnings per week are:
   \[
   3120 \times 0.40 = 1248
   \]

Thus, John makes \(\boxed{1248}\) dollars in a week.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. **5-year-old tree**: The tree produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree**: The tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits. Since the initial amount is 50 fruits, the tree produces:
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]

3. **7-year-old tree**: The tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits. Therefore, it produces:
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]

4. **8-year-old tree**: The tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We will calculate the 10-year-old tree's production first.

5. **9-year-old tree**: The tree doesn't produce any fruits, so it produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree**: The tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. Therefore, it produces:
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, we can determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree:
- The 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, which is:
  \[
  1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
  \]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

The total number of fruits produced over the 10 years is:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

- Let \( b \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is \( 4b \).
- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope's length is \( b + 7 \).

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
b + 4b + b + 7 = 37
\]

Combine like terms:

\[

\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
6b = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

\[
b = 5

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.

3. **Rissa's Remaining Money:**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount after giving money to their little sister.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: 
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

4. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3

We know the following:
1. The mural uses four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
3. Half of the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint used as \( r \). Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( r \), and the amount of purple paint is \( r \).

Since half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is half of the total paint, which is:
\[

   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - To find 20% of 100, we calculate: 
     \[
     20\% \times 100 = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20

1. **First piece of information:**
   - Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - Seven years from now, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).
   - Therefore, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times this future age of Colin:

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

**Step 1: Express \( W \) in terms of \( C \) using the first equation:**
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the second equation:**
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C}{3} + \frac{35}{3}
\]

Multiply every term by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Simplify:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( C \):**
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese pizza slices. Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is:

\[
6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese pizza slices}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cheese pizzas needed.**

Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ cheese pizza slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed.**

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices. Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is:

\[
6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pepperoni pizzas needed.**

Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of pizza pies needed.**

Adding the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas gives us the total number of pizza pies needed:

\[
3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Thus, Kate needs to buy a total of 6 pizza pies.

1. **Miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:**
   - Sam ran 3 miles each on these three days.
   - Total miles for these days: 
     \[
     3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}

1187,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net rate at which Jay is accumulating snowballs, taking into account both the rate at which he builds them and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. This means he builds:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ snowball}}{3 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

2. **Melting Rate**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means the melting rate is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Accumulation**: To find the net rate, subtract the melting rate from the building rate:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ snowball}}{3 \text{ minutes}} - \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

   First, convert the building rate to snowballs per minute:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ snowball}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

   Now, calculate the net rate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
   \]

   To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. Convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}
   \]

   Now subtract:
   \[
   \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

   So, the net rate is \(\frac{1}{5}\) snowballs per minute.

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs**: Jay needs to accumulate 60 snowballs at a net rate of \(\frac{1}{5}\) snowballs per minute. The time \(t\) in minutes required is given by:
   \[
   t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it came out 20 years ago.

2. **Calculate John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - Therefore, 20 years ago, John's age was:
     \[
     28 - 20 = 8
     \]

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - At that time, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let Jim's age 20 years ago be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim, so:
     \[
     8 = 2x

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: 10 fewer than the first day = 38 - 10 = 28

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 × 50 = 100 bandages
   - Bandages used: Half a pack = 50 / 2 = 25 bandages

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as \( x \).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the information:

- Initial bandages: \( x \)
- Bandages used over three days: \( 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 \)
- Bandages ordered over three days: \( 50 + 100 = 150 \)
- Bandages left at the end of the third day: 78

The equation representing the situation is:

\[ x - 91 + 150 = 78 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

Subtract 59 from both sides:

\[ x = 78 - 59 \]

\[ x = 19 \]

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

The average distance walked by the dogs is calculated by dividing the total distance walked by all the dogs by the number of dogs. We can set up the equation for the average as follows:

\[
\text{Average distance} = \frac{\text{Total distance walked by all dogs}}{\text{Number of dogs}}
\]

Given that the average distance is 3 miles, we can write:

\[
3 = \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4}
\]

where \( x \) is the distance the last dog needs to walk.

First, calculate the total distance walked by the first three dogs:

\[
1 + 4 + 3 = 8
\]

Now substitute this into the equation:

\[
3 = \frac{8 + x}{4}
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
3 \times 4 = 8 + x
\]

\[
12 = 8 + x
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[
12 - 8 = x
\]

\[
x = 4
\]

Thus, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

1206,"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the calculations based on the information provided:

1. **Calculate the loan amount:**  
   John gets a loan worth 40% of the value of his house. The house is worth $250,000.  
   To find 40% of $250,000, we calculate:  
   \[
   \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount used to pay off debts:**  
   John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.  
   To find 60% of $100,000, we calculate:  
   \[
   \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the leftover amount:**  
   To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount:  
   \[
   \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

Therefore, after paying off his debts, John has $40,000 leftover.

1208,"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Determine the Selling Price:**
   - Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them.
   - The cost price of the magazines is $72.
   - Therefore, the selling price is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
     \]

2. **Calculate the Selling Price:**
   - First, multiply 72 by 11:
     \[
     72 \times 11 = 792
     \]
   - Then, divide the result by 8:
     \[
     \frac{792}{8} = 99
     \]
   - So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
   - Therefore, the profit is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 27

According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, which is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:

   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. **Magazine with 6 issues per year:**
   Susan has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. Therefore, the total number of issues from this magazine is:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. **Magazine with 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine:**
   Susan's last magazine sends her 4 times the number of issues as the 6-issue magazine. Therefore, the total number of issues from this magazine is:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. According to the problem, Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means Shelley has 12 more paintings than Samantha.
   - So, we calculate the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has:
     \[
     \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39

1229,"To find the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November:** The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December:** The price increased by 80%. To calculate the new price after the increase, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

   \[
   \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Percentage Increase})
   \]

   Here, the percentage increase is 80%, or 0.80 in decimal form. So, the calculation is:

   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 \times (1 + 0.80) = 40 \times 1.80 = 72
   \]

   Thus, the price of the toy in December was $72.

3. **Price Decrease in January:** The price decreased by 50%. To calculate the new price after the decrease, we use the formula for percentage decrease:

   \[
   \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \text{Percentage Decrease})
   \]

   Here, the percentage decrease is 50%, or 0.50 in decimal form. So, the calculation is:

   \[
   \text{New Price in January} = 72 \times (1 - 0.50) = 72 \times 0.50 = 36
   \]

   Therefore, the price of the toy after the discount in January was $36.

1230,"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both his standard rate lessons and his reduced rate lessons for veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. Today, he has 4 lessons at this rate. Therefore, the earnings from the standard rate lessons are:

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times 80 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from the lessons with veterans. Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veterans. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the reduced rate for veterans is:

\[ 80 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate. Therefore, the earnings from the veteran lessons are:

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times 60 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

1. **First side:** It takes John 5 minutes to solve the first side.

2. **Second side:** The second side takes twice as long as the first side. Therefore, it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.

3. **Third side:** Similarly, the third side also takes twice as long as the first side, which is another 10 minutes.

4. **Fourth side:** The fourth side takes half as long as the first side. Therefore, it takes \(\frac{1}{2} \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.

5. **Fifth side:** The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, which is another 2.5 minutes.

Once John completes the fifth side, he has effectively solved all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube.

Now, we add up the time taken for each side:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30\) minutes.

1253,"To determine how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to calculate the total number of calls he handles each day and then multiply that by the number of days he works.

First, we need to find out how many calls Tim can handle in one day. He spends 6 hours each day answering phones. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the hours into minutes:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he can handle in 360 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the minutes per call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls} \]

So, Tim can handle 24 calls in one day.

Finally, to find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days he works:

First, let's calculate the drying time for 6 paintings using the old varnish:
- With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- Therefore, for 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(6 \times 7 = 42\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the drying time for 6 paintings using the new varnish:

1. **Cost of the tickets:**
   - There are two parents, so they need 2 adult tickets. Each adult ticket costs $12.
   - Therefore, the cost for the adult tickets is: 
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - There is one child, so they need 1 child ticket. The child ticket costs $8.
   - Therefore, the cost for the child ticket is:

1. **Weight of the car:** 1200 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage:** 250 pounds
3. **Weight of the children:** 75 pounds each, so for two children: \( 75 \times 2 = 150 \) pounds

First, let's calculate the number of each item Avery needs. Since she is having 12 people over for dinner, she will need 12 dinner plates, 12 salad plates, and 12 bowls.

Next, we calculate the cost for each type of item:

1. **Dinner Plates:**
   - Cost per dinner plate = $6.00
   - Total cost for dinner plates = Number of dinner plates × Cost per dinner plate
   - Total cost for dinner plates = 12 × $6.00 = $72.00

2. **Salad Plates:**

  \[
  1.5 \, \text{pounds} \times 8 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- **Honey cost:**  
  Each jar requires 2 pounds of honey.  
  The cost per pound of honey is $10.  
  Therefore, the cost for honey per jar is:  
  \[
  2 \, \text{pounds} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 20 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

- **Total cost per jar:**  
  Adding up all the costs for one jar:  
  \[
  12 \, \text{dollars (passion fruit)} + 12 \, \text{dollars (jackfruit)} + 20 \, \text{dollars (honey)} = 44 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.**

- The cost to produce 10 jars is:  
  \[
  10 \, \text{jars} \times 44 \, \text{dollars/jar} = 440 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars.**

- Each jar is sold for $50.  
- The revenue from selling 10 jars is:  
  \[
  10 \, \text{jars} \times 50 \, \text{dollars/jar} = 500 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

- Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.  
  \[
  500 \, \text{dollars (revenue)} - 440 \, \text{dollars (cost)} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60.

First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances:

1. **Aaron's Speed and Distance:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

2. **Vanessa's Speed and Distance:**
   - Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

Let's denote:
- \( v_A \) as Aaron's speed in miles per minute.
- \( v_V \) as Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we have:
\[ v_A = 2v_V \]

Now, let's calculate Aaron's distance:
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
- The distance Aaron ran can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

Let \( d_A \) be the distance Aaron ran. Then:
\[ d_A = v_A \times 16 \]

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron:
\[ d_V = 2d_A \]

We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, so:
\[ d_V = 4 \]

Substituting \( d_V = 2d_A \) into the equation:
\[ 4 = 2d_A \]
\[ d_A = 2 \]

Now, we know Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, Aaron's speed \( v_A \) is:
\[ v_A = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since \( v_A = 2v_V \), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{8} = 2v_V \]
\[ v_V = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles:
- Using the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\),
- Vanessa's time \( t_V \) is:
\[ t_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( w \) as the number of cows.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. We can write the following equations based on these facts:

1. \( c + w = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2c + 4w = 70 \) (since the total number of legs is 70)

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Let's start with the first equation:

\[ c + w = 20 \]

From this, we can express \( w \) in terms of \( c \):

\[ w = 20 - c \]

Now, substitute \( w = 20 - c \) into the second equation:

\[ 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):

\[ 2c + 80 - 4c = 70 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ -2c + 80 = 70 \]

Subtract 80 from both sides:

\[ -2c = 70 - 80 \]

\[ -2c = -10 \]

Divide both sides by -2:

\[ c = 5 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens.
