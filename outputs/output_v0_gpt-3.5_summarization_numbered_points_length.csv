1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, such as ratchet systems, are not well understood. These systems involve directed transport in asymmetric periodic potentials and have origins in extracting work from noisy fluctuations in biological systems.
2. Recent studies have focused on chaotic deterministic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, which exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter changes. The behavior of these systems can transition from regular to chaotic, leading to complex phase-space structures with stability islands and chaotic seas.
3. Mateos proposed a connection between current direction reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in ratchet models. However, subsequent investigations by Barbi and Salerno suggested that current reversals can occur without bifurcations, attributing them to different stability properties of periodic orbits.
4. The dynamics of chaotic ratchets are not straightforward, and the behavior of an ensemble of particles can significantly impact the current. Ensembles of particles in chaotic systems exhibit net directed transport, but the details depend on system parameters and ensemble characteristics.
5. Bifurcations in single-trajectory behavior often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system. Current reversals are a special case of this heuristic, but not all spikes or jumps necessarily correspond to bifurcations.
6. The dependence on ensemble characteristics is critical near certain bifurcation points, and it is important to factor out issues of size, location, spread, and transience in computing the current due to an ensemble. The heuristic that bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes enhances our ability to characterize changes in current behavior.
7. Not all spikes or jumps in the current correspond to bifurcations, and vice versa, indicating that there are situations where the heuristics may not apply. Understanding when these rules are violated or valid remains an open question in the study of chaotic deterministic ratchets.
8. Collaborative efforts and discussions have contributed to the understanding of chaotic ratchets, with researchers acknowledging the importance of ensemble characteristics, parameter dependencies, and the relationship between bifurcations and current behavior in these complex systems.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit correlations that go beyond classical descriptions, with varying degrees of non-classicality. Non-separable or entangled states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states and violate local hidden state models.
2. Bell-nonlocality is a phenomenon where measurement correlations violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality. It is a way for spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement when trust in detectors is lacking.
3. EPR-steering is a way to verify entanglement when one party or their detectors cannot be trusted. It allows for correlations that cannot be explained by a local hidden state model.
4. The hierarchy of non-locality concepts includes Bell-nonlocality, EPR-steerability, and non-separability. Pure states exhibit all three types of non-locality, while mixed states have a richer structure of quantum and classical correlations.
5. The EPR-steerability of two-qubit states, specifically T-states with maximally mixed reduced states, is investigated. A deterministic local hidden state model is developed for projective measurements on T-states, with sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability derived.
6. The quantum steering ellipsoid formalism is used to develop the deterministic local hidden state model for T-states. Two asymmetric steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states are derived to determine EPR-steerability.
7. The necessary condition for EPR-steerability of T-states is defined by a surface in the space of possible spin correlation matrices. Sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability are derived using linear and nonlinear steering inequalities.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems with a white dwarf primary and a low mass main sequence secondary that transfers mass to the white dwarf. The orbital period distribution of CVs shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour range and a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have struggled to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the orbital period distribution near this cut-off. Various mechanisms, such as consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) and donor star deformation, have been explored to explain the discrepancies.
2. The minimum orbital period in CVs is influenced by factors such as mass transfer rate, thermal equilibrium, and angular momentum losses. Models have been developed to investigate ways to increase the period minimum by adjusting the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of values in the CV population. Theoretical calculations of long-term CV evolution have been conducted, considering effects like CAML and donor star deformation. The observed period distribution of CVs has been compared with various synthesized model distributions to assess the fit and significance of different evolutionary parameters.
3. Despite efforts to address the period minimum and period spike discrepancies in CVs, the issues remain unresolved. Model populations have been tested against the observed CV period distribution using statistical tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Different mechanisms, such as varying CAML efficiencies and donor star deformations, have been explored to explain the observed distribution. The study highlights the challenges in accurately modeling the orbital period distribution of CVs and the need for further research to better understand the underlying physical processes driving the evolution of these binary systems.

1. The spectra of type 1 AGN show a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of gas near the central massive object. Two populations of type 1 AGN have been identified based on broad-line widths, with population A having smaller widths and population B having larger widths. FeII emission, which correlates with FeII and Hα line widths, is found to be ubiquitous in the brightest SDSS quasars. However, there is no evidence for systematic FeII redshifts in the bright quasar sample composites.
2. FeII redshifts reported in previous studies are not confirmed in the analysis of FeII shifts relative to narrow lines and broad Hα emission. The accuracy of FeII shift measures depends on FeII strength, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and the presence of HeII 4686 emission. The exclusion of HeII 4686 from fits can lead to a false impression of FeII redshift in low-luminosity samples.

1. The scientific community relies on citation mechanisms to identify high-quality publications enriched with original ideas. The number of citations a paper receives is often used as a measure of its credibility, although it may not always accurately reflect the paper's impact. Feedback from citations can be valuable for authors, leading to a demand for statistical analysis of citation data.
2. Empirical studies have shown that the distribution of citations follows a power-law form, with highly cited papers more likely to receive further citations. Network models have been developed to mimic the complex structure of citation distributions, but they often focus on total citations without considering the issuing publications. Scientific publications often bridge different research areas by referencing findings from other disciplines.
3. A simple model is proposed to investigate referencing patterns between two research areas, applicable to networks like the web of human sexual contacts. The model involves the introduction of new nodes with outgoing links that attach preferentially to existing nodes in both networks. The rate of acquiring a link depends on the number of connections and the initial attractiveness of the nodes.
4. The model's time evolution is analyzed using rate equations, leading to the derivation of distributions for intra-links and cross-links in the networks. The distribution of nodes with incoming links follows a power-law form, with exponents depending on parameters like initial attractiveness and coupling strength. The model can represent various complex systems, such as citation networks and human sexual contact networks.
5. The model's flexibility allows it to capture the dynamics of different systems, including citation networks and human sexual contact networks. By adjusting parameters like coupling strength, the model can reproduce observed power-law distributions in empirical studies. Financial support from organizations like the China Scholarship Council and EPSRC, as well as discussions with experts, have contributed to the development and analysis of the model.

The correlation between the W boson mass and the top quark mass in the Standard Model can be used to limit the allowed region for the Higgs boson mass.
2. Models with Higgs particles in representations other than doublets and singlets have more parameters in the gauge/Higgs sector than the Standard Model, requiring extra input parameters for renormalization. Phenomenological studies have considered contributions from new physics beyond the Standard Model, showing that the SM is not recovered when the scale of new physics is much larger than the electroweak scale.
3. The possibility of a heavy Higgs boson consistent with precision electroweak data has been explored in the context of oblique corrections. The triplet model provides an explicit realization of this mechanism, showing that the scalar masses in the W-boson mass dependence are quadratic and non-decoupling.
4. The non-decoupling property of the triplet model is seen in the dependence of the W-boson mass on the top quark mass, demonstrating that the scalar fields must be included in any effective field theory analysis of low-energy physics. The quadratic dependence on scalar masses has important implications for models with triplets, such as the Littlest Higgs model.
5. The LR model also shows non-decoupling effects, with the dependence of the W-boson mass on the top quark mass weakened compared to the SM. The LR model requires a fourth input parameter for consistent renormalization, and the discontinuity between the LR model and the SM highlights the importance of correctly accounting for new physics effects in renormalization.

The embedding scheme for the Dirac equation allows for the explicit solution of a limited region within a larger system, with region ii replaced by an additional term in the Hamiltonian for region i. The method is stable and converges to exact eigenvalues, as demonstrated in calculations for a confined hydrogen atom and an Au/Ag/Au sandwich structure.
2. The scheme involves a trial function that is discontinuous in the small component, leading to solutions that are continuous in both large and small components when the embedding potential is evaluated at the same energy as the Dirac equation itself. This approach has been successfully used in various applications, including determining currents and transport properties.
3. Further considerations include exploring alternative formulations of the trial function, investigating the spectrum of negative energy solutions, and adapting novel schemes for deriving embedding potentials to the relativistic case.

1. Open dielectric resonators have various applications, such as microlasers and sensors, and are studied as chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities ranges from a few to several hundred wavelengths, and semiclassical methods are used for their analysis.
2. The field distributions of resonance states in dielectric cavities can be localized on periodic orbits, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from ray dynamics. Semiclassical corrections are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
3. Trace formulas relate the density of states of a system to the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system. A trace formula for two-dimensional dielectric resonators has been developed and tested successfully in experiments with microwave resonators and polymer microlasers.
4. However, there is a lack of investigation into the trace formula for three-dimensional dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of numerically solving the full 3D Maxwell equations. Flat dielectric cavities are often treated as 2D systems using an effective index of refraction, but this introduces errors.

The comparison of experimental and calculated resonance frequencies further highlighted the limitations of the effective index of refraction model.

2. By using monte-carlo simulations, the lattice spacing in 2D colloidal crystals can be predicted from the electric field strength, allowing for a quantitative comparison of tunable interactions and material properties.

Networks of randomly distributed single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are being used for various applications, especially in electronics, leading to a need for accurate determination of their electrical properties. These networks exhibit percolation behavior with nonlinear thickness dependence, with metallic behavior dominating in thicker films. Frequency- and electric field-dependent conductivity have been studied for individual SWCNTs and networks, showing interesting behavior such as power law frequency dependence and nonlinearity in electric field dependence.

1. The supernova remnant G65.2@xmath05.7, initially ignored after being identified, has regained interest due to its classification as a thermal composite SNR. This classification is based on its shell-like radio continuum morphology and centrally bright x-ray emission. Various theories suggest reasons for this morphology, including radiative phase evolution and interactions with molecular clouds.
2. Optical observations revealed the true extent of G65.2@xmath05.7, showing dense shell fragments and postshock cooling regions. Radio and x-ray observations confirmed its thermal composite classification, with a centrally filled x-ray morphology and slowly decreasing temperature gradient. The remnant's age, distance, and luminosity were estimated, supporting its classification as a thermal composite SNR.
3. Analysis of _ROSAT_ data confirmed the extended and centrally filled x-ray emission of G65.2@xmath05.7, with slightly harder emission towards the interior. Spectral modeling showed a shallow temperature gradient and lower electron density compared to other thermal composite SNRs. The presence of a slightly extended point source within the remnant was noted, but no pulsar was found at that location.

Optical evidence of cooling behind G65.2@xmath05.7's shockfront supports this hypothesis. The remnant's age indicates it is the oldest known thermal composite SNR, and the possibility of interactions with molecular clouds remains inconclusive.

1. The study utilizes data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to investigate the relationship between star formation and cluster mass and location within 69 local galaxy clusters at low redshifts. The study finds that the fraction of star-forming galaxies and the mean specific star formation rate of cluster galaxies increase with distance from the cluster center, but remain below field values even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.
2. Despite the increase in star formation with distance, there is no significant correlation between cluster specific star formation rate and cluster mass, indicating that mechanisms such as ram pressure or harassment, which scale with cluster mass, do not play a dominant role in star formation evolution in local clusters. The lack of correlation suggests that star formation is quenched in galaxies in small groups or filaments before they enter the cluster environment.
3. The study also suggests that strangulation, a process where a galaxy's hot halo gas is removed upon entering the cluster environment, may be a plausible mechanism for quenching star formation in cluster galaxies. The results are consistent with previous studies that have found no significant correlation between cluster specific star formation rate and cluster mass, supporting the idea that evolutionary effects may be more influential.
4. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex interplay between cluster mass, location within a cluster, and star formation rates in galaxies. By utilizing WISE and SDSS data, the study sheds light on the mechanisms that regulate star formation in dense environments and highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in understanding galaxy evolution within clusters.

1. The frozen nucleon approximation is a fast and efficient method for calculating the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic fermi gas model. By neglecting the momentum dependence of the two holes in the ground state and using an averaged @xmath1 propagator, the approximation reduces the calculation to a one-dimensional integral. This approach provides accurate results for a range of momentum transfers, making it suitable for implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo event generators and modifying parameters within the codes.
2. The frozen approximation has been validated through comparisons with exact calculations and shell model results, showing good agreement in the transverse electromagnetic 2p-2h response functions. The approximation works well for momentum transfers above the fermi momentum, where the sharing of energy and momentum between the nucleons leads to a soft dependence on the initial state. This method offers a practical and reliable way to compute 2p-2h responses efficiently, demonstrating its potential for future studies on nuclear species and further model developments.

These disk models are of great astrophysical interest and can be used to represent galaxies or accretion disks. The method involves dividing space into two parts, one with sources and one without, and then reflecting the nonsingular part to create a disk with a singularity at the boundary. The method has been applied to generate disks made of perfect fluid with well-behaved density and pressure.

2. The generated disk models have positive surface energy density and pressures, with the radial pressure equal to the azimuthal pressure. The method can also be used to construct disks surrounded by a halo of perfect fluid matter. The density and pressure of the disks decrease monotonically with radius, and the sound velocity and tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion are restricted to be less than the speed of light. The tangential velocity reaches a maximum and then decreases with radius.

3. The stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is determined using an extension of Rayleigh's criteria. The disks generated from the method exhibit regions of unstable orbits for high relativistic disks. Parameters can be chosen to ensure that the disks have no unstable circular orbits.

Perturbative corrections to the mean-field solution are derived to improve the description of short-range correlations. Numerical results show corrections to local observables and the density matrix, with perturbation theory providing a better description of the short-range behavior. Expansion patterns are studied to visualize the differences between the Mott and superfluid phases, with perturbative corrections leading to modifications in the expansion patterns.

Perturbative corrections to expansion patterns in such situations show substantial modifications, with different behaviors observed for different constellations of superfluid and Mott-insulator regions. Comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo results show good qualitative agreement in high superfluid fraction cases but discrepancies in situations with a large Mott-insulator fraction.

Trigonometric parallax astrometry was conducted to estimate the distance to LSPM J2322 + 7847, indicating it is likely an M-dwarf. The star Hip 115147 is known for its extreme ultraviolet activity and high x-ray luminosity, suggesting a very young age of less than 20 million years.
2. Photometric data and model isochrones were used to estimate the age of Hip 115147 and its companions, with the best fit found for a 50 million year isochrone. The metallicity of Hip 115147 was determined to be subsolar, potentially influenced by its high chromospheric activity. Comparison with other young stars in the solar neighborhood suggests an age older than 16 million years but younger than 52 million years.
3. The star Hip 115147 is believed to have originated from the Ophiuchus star forming region, with a probable age of 16 million years. However, the high departing velocity of the star suggests that its close proximity to the Ophiuchus association may be a chance occurrence. The proper motion difference between Hip 115147 and LSPM J2322 + 7847 indicates they may not be gravitationally bound, but rather part of a moving group of young stars in the vicinity.
4. Further observations and analysis are needed to clarify the dynamical status of the Hip 115147 system, including accurate proper motions and spectroscopic radial velocities. The evidence suggests that LSPM J2322 + 7847 is one of the youngest stars in the near solar neighborhood. The research was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and made use of data from the SIMBAD database and 2MASS project.
5. The study also involved photometric observations, trigonometric parallax astrometry, and model isochrone analysis to estimate the age and properties of Hip 115147 and its companions.

Experiments have confirmed the creation of quark matter, with a consensus on the formation of a quark-gluon liquid with low viscosity.
2. Theoretical calculations estimate critical temperatures for the creation of quark matter at high temperature and baryon density. The phase of quark matter may exist in the early universe after the cosmic big bang or in super-dense stars. Quark matter can also be created in heavy ion collisions in accelerators.
3. The Landau Fermi liquid theory is used to describe relativistic systems like quark matter and quark gluon plasma. Thermodynamic properties of quark matter are calculated based on interactions between quarks using the one gluon exchange scheme.

1. The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors has been shown to have a predominant d-wave pairing symmetry, with thermal transport measurements confirming the predominance of this symmetry for the gap function. The angular variation of the thermal conductivity depends on the heat transport by quasiparticles, their interaction with supercurrents, and the symmetry of the order parameter. The nodal characteristics of the gap are directly observable by thermal conductivity at low temperatures, while thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature affects the symmetry of the gap.
2. Measurements of the longitudinal thermal conductivity in ybco single crystals at different temperatures and angles in a magnetic field parallel to the cuo6 planes show a fourfold oscillation at low temperatures. The oscillation amplitude increases with increasing magnetic field strength, with a competition between the doppler shift and andreev scattering mechanisms influencing the behavior. The experimental results are well described by a model involving andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the two-dimensional brt expression for thermal conductivity assuming a d-wave pairing symmetry.
3. The symmetry of the thermal conductivity curves differs slightly between twinned and untwinned samples, with impurity scatterers affecting the directionality of the andreev scattering and doppler shift mechanisms. The temperature dependence of the gap structure and the relative increase of the inelastic scattering rate contribute to changes in the thermal conductivity patterns at different temperatures. The experimental results support the predominance of the d-wave pairing symmetry of the order parameter up to temperatures close to the critical temperature.
4. The overall results suggest that the behavior of quasiparticles below the critical temperature and above a certain temperature range is well described by the fermi liquid theory, with small differences in the angle patterns between twinned and untwinned samples explained by impurity concentration and oxygen deficiency. The agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical model indicates that the mechanisms influencing quasiparticle behavior in high-temperature superconductors are consistent with the fermi liquid theory at nearly optimal doping levels.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties such as calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor-invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariance. These models require sequestering the hidden sector on a separate brane from the observable sector in extra-dimensional universes to avoid tachyonic states.
2. The minimal AMSB model suffers from negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be resolved by adding a universal mass term. An alternative setup, hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB), localizes SUSY breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, leading to a different mass spectrum and parameter space.
3. HCAMSB models feature left-right splitting of scalar masses, severe left-right splitting of third-generation squarks, and a large mass gap between the lightest stau state and other sparticles. The mass ordering in HCAMSB models leads to distinct event characteristics at the LHC compared to AMSB models.
4. The reach of the LHC for HCAMSB models is lower than for AMSB models due to differences in the sparticle mass spectrum and event characteristics. HCAMSB models predict a high multiplicity of top and bottom quarks in collider events, along with long-lived wino-like charginos.
5. The composition of neutralinos in HCAMSB models differs from AMSB models, leading to distinct dilepton invariant mass distributions in cascade decay events. The reach of the LHC for HCAMSB models depends on the value of the parameter governing the hypercharge contribution to soft terms.
6. HCAMSB models can be distinguished from AMSB models at the LHC based on the mass spectrum, event characteristics, and sparticle branching fractions. The presence of long-lived wino-like charginos and distinct event topologies can serve as signatures for HCAMSB models.
7. The study of HCAMSB models at the LHC provides insights into the parameter space, sparticle mass spectrum, and expected collider events. The distinct features of HCAMSB models compared to AMSB models offer opportunities for testing supersymmetry and exploring new physics scenarios at the LHC.

1. The zero range potential (ZRP) approach offers an exact solution to scattering problems by representing the potential as a boundary condition or pseudopotential. Darboux transformation (DT) can be used to construct solvable potentials and modify the ZRP model. By dressing the ZRP with DT, it is possible to improve the model's capabilities and generate potentials with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels.

2. The ZRP model can be extended to multi-centered potentials by using DT to correct and add poles to the scattering matrix. The dressing procedure involves defining free parameters of solutions and modifying boundary conditions on dressed wavefunctions. DT introduces short-range cores of centrifugal type in the potential, leading to the generation of complex poles corresponding to quasi-stationary states.

3. The application of DT in multi-center scattering problems allows for corrections to the ZRP model at low energies and the possibility of inducing long-range forces depending on angular momentum. By considering higher partial waves in the scattering process, the agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental results can be improved, especially at higher collision energies.

1. Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Fermilab Tevatron. These gaps are attributed to color singlet quanta exchange between incident partons, with the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state being a simple model. The observation of rapidity gaps at the Tevatron demonstrates the relevance of color singlet exchange effects at high momentum transfers, allowing for perturbative methods to be used for quantitative descriptions.
2. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of about one percent in dijet events due to color singlet exchange, with a survival probability estimating the fraction of hard dijet events without soft interactions. The color singlet fraction in elastic scattering was estimated in terms of the imaginary part of the two-gluon exchange amplitude. The two-gluon exchange model predicts a growth in the color singlet fraction with the color charge of the scattered partons.
3. Recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron show no significant effect on the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse energy, casting doubt on the validity of the two-gluon exchange model. The limitations of the two-gluon exchange model are demonstrated, showing that the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative. Unitarity constraints and the diagonalization of amplitudes in momentum and color space are discussed.
4. The unitarization of the two-gluon exchange model is analyzed, showing that the two-gluon exchange approximation violates partial wave unitarity. The unitarized amplitude is needed for phenomenological applications, preserving the successful description of hard dijet events by perturbative QCD. The unitarization of hard elastic quark and gluon scattering is shown to be necessary for a quantitative understanding of the color singlet exchange process.
5. The unitarized gluon exchange model is capable of fitting the Tevatron data, but the strong dependence on regularization parameters highlights the limitations of a perturbative approach to color singlet exchange probability. The formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence, requiring a theoretical explanation within QCD. The unitarized gluon exchange model provides a unified phenomenological description of rapidity gap data.

1. Ground ambulance services are provided by various organizations with different structures, staffing types, and revenue sources. Medicare payments for ambulance services consist of service-level and mileage payments, with providers being affiliated with institutions or independent. Revenue sources include community tax support, charitable donations, and payments from Medicare or private insurance companies.
2. Providers may specialize in nonemergency or emergency transports, with some offering only basic life support (BLS) services and others offering advanced life support (ALS) services. Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule, with payments having two components: service-level payment and mileage payment. Providers with lower transport volumes generally have higher costs per transport due to high fixed costs for maintaining readiness.
3. In 2010, providers' costs for ground ambulance transports varied significantly, ranging from $224 to $2,204 per transport. Personnel costs accounted for the largest percentage of total costs and contributed the most to cost increases between 2009 and 2010. The median Medicare margin for providers in 2010 was about positive 2 percent, but decreased to negative 1 percent when add-on payments were removed.
4. Ambulance transports for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in the nation increased by 33 percent from 2004 to 2010, with growth seen in urban, rural, and super-rural areas. The increase in ambulance transports was primarily due to an increase in BLS nonemergency transports. Factors such as age, race, and sex remained stable from 2004 to 2010 in urban, rural, and super-rural areas.
5. Some of the increase in ambulance transports was attributed to increased billing for Medicare ambulance services at the local-government level. The national fee schedule introduced in 2002 may have contributed to increased billing by allowing providers to anticipate revenue. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that improper payments for ambulance services were primarily for nonemergency transports.
6. Regression analysis showed that providers with higher government subsidies tend to have higher costs. The use of volunteer staff did not significantly contribute to differences in providers' total costs. Medicare payments for providers in 2010 were lower due to factors such as the expiration of temporary payment increases and the introduction of a productivity adjustment.
7. The reliability of Medicare claims data was assessed by comparing payments in a sample of claims to expected payments based on the ambulance fee schedule. Medicare claims data were found to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of the report.

1. Supply Chain Integration, an office under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics & Materiel Readiness, is responsible for developing DOD supply chain policies and improving accountability of critical assets, including SRC I ammunition. The Army plays a significant role in managing SRC I ammunition, procuring a majority of the department's ammunition and providing storage for other military services. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, under USTRANSCOM, tracks the movement of SRC I ammunition and coordinates responses to transportation issues while in transit. DOD policy requires SRC I ammunition to have a higher level of protection and security than other conventional ammunition.
2. The military services have entities responsible for the accountability, physical inventory, and transportation of SRC I ammunition. Each service has automated information systems for managing accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition, maintaining item-specific data such as serial number, production lot number, and quantity. The department is evaluating various automated information systems to designate one as the DOD-wide authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition, including SRC I ammunition. The evaluation is in response to a congressional mandate to issue department-wide guidance by September 2015 to designate an authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition.
3. Since 1994, reports have been issued on the management of SRC I ammunition, focusing on serial-number registration, physical inventories, and transportation issues. Recommendations have been made to strengthen inventory accountability, manage SRC I rockets by serial number, and implement internal controls consistent with federal standards. The military services have maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition at sampled locations in the continental United States, but gaps exist in some service-level guidance and procedures for accountability across locations.
4. The military services have policies and plans for maintaining in-transit accountability for SRC I ammunition, with the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps generally adhering to DOD requirements. However, the Army's policy and processes do not fully comply with DOD requirements for maintaining accountability of in-transit items. The Army does not retain accountability for all in-transit items within the logistics records until acknowledgment of receipt, which creates a potential gap in accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition.
5. The military services have not consistently ensured timely, complete, and accurate information to maintain full visibility of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States.

The IAEA derives its authority from various treaties and agreements, including the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT requires non-nuclear weapon states to conclude agreements with the IAEA to apply safeguards to all nuclear material in their territories. The five nuclear weapons states that are parties to the NPT have voluntarily entered into safeguards agreements with the IAEA.
2. India, Israel, and Pakistan are not parties to the NPT, and they have nuclear weapons programs. North Korea briefly accepted safeguards in 1992 and 1993 but later withdrew from the NPT.

The global nature of the problem adds to the risk, with many countries lagging behind in addressing the issue. The government has been slow in fixing its systems, with only about 40 percent of mission-critical systems being compliant by May 1998.

2. Federal agencies, such as the FAA, Social Security Administration, and Department of Defense, have made progress in addressing the Year 2000 issue but still face challenges. Contingency planning, end-to-end testing, and data exchanges are critical areas that need improvement. State and local governments also face risks of service disruptions due to Year 2000 problems, with many states reporting limited progress in assessing and remediating critical systems. Greater leadership, partnerships, and increased efforts are necessary to prevent major disruptions as the new millennium approaches.

1. In the mid-1970s, structural changes in the American economy led to the dislocation of workers, prompting the implementation of worker profiling to identify those likely to face long periods of joblessness. The Clinton administration proposed legislation in 1993 to implement worker profiling, requiring states to establish systems to identify claimants likely to exhaust benefits and refer them to reemployment services. States use statistical models or characteristic screens to identify claimants likely to exhaust benefits, with some states facing challenges in updating their models to maintain predictive accuracy over time.
2. While early studies showed positive impacts of worker profiling on reducing UI duration and increasing subsequent employment earnings, there is limited current data on the effectiveness of the initiative. States provide reemployment services to referred claimants, but the services offered may not align with Labor's original vision for in-depth assessments and tailored service plans. Labor's data collection on worker profiling outcomes has limitations, and there is a need for a more active federal role to ensure the accuracy of state profiling models and evaluate the program's impact on reemployment.

The military health system has three missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness for wartime casualties, and providing care to dependents, retirees, and survivors of military personnel. TRICARE was implemented in the mid-1990s to improve beneficiary access and quality while containing costs. TRICARE offers three options: Prime, Extra, and Standard, covering inpatient and outpatient services, skilled nursing, and prescription drugs. Medicare covers health care expenses for the elderly, some people with disabilities, and those with end-stage kidney disease.
2. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees, receiving part A benefits and optional part B benefits. Medicare beneficiaries can choose traditional Medicare or Medicare+Choice, which allows enrollment in private managed care plans. TRICARE For Life, a program under Medicare, provides expanded health care coverage for older military retirees. The Medicare subvention demonstration allowed DOD to create managed care organizations participating in Medicare+Choice.
3. The demonstration aimed to provide care to older retirees through Senior Prime, a DOD-run managed care organization. Senior Prime enrollees had higher utilization of services compared to similar Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. DOD's costs for Senior Prime enrollees were considerably higher than the capitation rate, mainly due to high utilization. Medicare payment to DOD for Senior Prime care in 1999 was capped at $60 million.
4. DOD's costs for Senior Prime enrollees in 1999 were $586 per person per month, while the capitation rate was $320 per person per month. Senior Prime enrollees were healthier on average than fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. DOD's costs were higher due to the design of the Senior Prime benefit package and high utilization by enrollees. Medicare did not pay DOD for Senior Prime care in 1999.
5. The BBA required DOD to maintain its level of effort (LOE) in providing care to older military retirees, ensuring that the government would not pay for the same care twice. DOD's LOE was based on the amount spent on space-available care for retirees in 1996. DOD's costs for Senior Prime enrollees were much higher than the capitation rate, resulting in no payment from Medicare in 1999.

1. The exchange rate policies of East Asian nations like China, Japan, and South Korea have been a source of tension with the United States due to accusations of currency manipulation to keep exports competitive. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires enhanced analysis of exchange rates for major trading partners, with six countries placed on a ""Monitoring List."" East Asian nations adopt various exchange rate policies, including fixed, free float, and managed float, depending on economic and political interests. Some nations, like Hong Kong and Singapore, prefer pegged exchange rates to avoid currency volatility.
2. A pegged exchange rate virtually eliminates exchange-rate risk but limits autonomy in domestic monetary policy. Managed float policies allow currencies to fluctuate until certain economic indicators reach critical levels, with some nations using a ""crawling peg"" approach. China, for example, adopted a crawling peg policy in 2005, allowing gradual appreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar. However, maintaining a fixed exchange rate, free capital movement, and independent monetary policy simultaneously is challenging for nations.
3. The Department of the Treasury provides biannual reports to Congress on exchange rate policies of foreign countries, with recent reports placing major trading partners like China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan on a ""Monitoring List."" China has a history of large-scale foreign exchange intervention, while Japan has a significant trade surplus with the U.S. South Korea and Taiwan have also engaged in foreign exchange interventions, prompting calls for more transparent policies. U.S. policy generally supports a ""free float"" exchange rate, but many East Asian governments prefer a ""managed float"" approach.
4. East Asian governments may resist a ""free float"" policy due to past experiences during financial crises, where economies with more liberal exchange rate policies suffered. The impact of adopting ""free float"" policies on U.S. trade deficits with East Asian countries remains uncertain, with no consensus among economists on the potential outcomes. The Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act aims to impose countervailing duties on countries with ""fundamentally undervalued"" currencies, based on criteria like large-scale intervention and undervaluation of the real effective exchange rate.
5. The act also considers factors like persistent global current account surpluses and excessive foreign asset reserves as indicators of undervalued currencies. The debate over foreign exchange rate policies and their impact on the U.S. economy continues in the 115th Congress, with ongoing discussions on the implications of currency manipulation.

The current system allows for deductions of losses against gains and ordinary income, with a $3,000 annual limit. The concentration of capital gains and losses is higher among upper-income individuals, and increasing the loss deduction limit would primarily benefit them. However, there are concerns that such a change may not effectively stimulate the economy and could lead to further market volatility.

The current asymmetry allows for net long-term losses to be deducted against short-term gains and ordinary income. Suggestions for increasing the net loss deduction limit raise concerns about gaming the system and the potential impact on stock market values. Restoring the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level would require addressing the asymmetry in the tax treatment of gains and losses.

1. High risk health insurance pools have been established in 35 states to provide coverage for individuals with preexisting health conditions who cannot obtain or afford insurance in the private market. These pools target those who have been denied coverage, received high quotes, or faced exclusions for preexisting conditions. State high risk pools enroll a small percentage of the uninsured population, with limited enrollment reflecting the narrow focus on individuals with preexisting conditions seeking coverage in the private market.
2. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established a temporary high risk pool program to provide coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions who have been uninsured for six months. High risk pools operate at a loss and are often underfunded, leading to unaffordable premiums and limited coverage for preexisting conditions. Some researchers doubt the effectiveness of high risk pools in reducing the number of uninsured individuals, especially those with serious medical conditions.
3. State high risk pools are operated through nonprofit organizations and overseen by boards with representatives from various sectors. Premiums in high risk pools are capped to limit costs for individuals with costly medical conditions. States use various funding sources, including assessments on insurers and federal grants, to cover operating expenses and losses incurred by the pools.
4. Eligibility criteria for high risk pools vary by state, with many allowing HIPAA-eligible individuals and those with specific medical conditions to enroll. Participation in high risk pools varies significantly across states, with average enrollment numbers ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands. Federal funding has been provided to states through grant programs to support the establishment and operation of high risk pools.
5. The federal government has provided financial assistance to states through grants to establish and operate high risk pools. Funding formulas for operational grants have changed over the years, with Congress reauthorizing and appropriating funds for these programs. High risk pools serve as a safety net for individuals with preexisting conditions who cannot access health insurance in the private market, but there are concerns about their ability to effectively reduce the number of uninsured individuals.

1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) was created in 1951 to meet the nation's airlift needs in times of crisis, managed jointly by the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Transportation (DOT). CRAF participants must be U.S. carriers certified by the FAA, committing a percentage of their passenger and cargo fleets. Activation of CRAF occurs in three stages based on the level of crisis, with carriers having 24 to 48 hours to prepare for missions once activated.

2. CRAF has been activated twice in its history, during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Iraqi Freedom, transporting passengers and cargo at a lower cost than acquiring and maintaining additional military aircraft. Recent legislation, such as the FY2008 NDAA, called for assessments of CRAF viability and the size and mix of the airlift force. The study plan for the latter includes analyzing lift requirements, fleet capabilities, and the impact of CRAF on DOD's airlift needs.

3. The future of CRAF may be influenced by factors such as economic conditions for commercial carriers, potential changes in DOD's strategic airlift requirements, and the acquisition of new tanker aircraft.

1. The United States has approximately 766 million acres of forestlands, with the majority being privately owned. The federal government provides assistance for forest management on private and public forests through programs administered by the Forest Service. These programs support various goals such as wildfire planning, wood product development, and conservation efforts.
2. Forestry assistance programs have been a part of USDA's initiatives for over a century, with specific programs authorized by legislation like the Clarke-McNary Act and the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act. The 2008 and 2014 farm bills made significant changes to forestry assistance programs, setting funding priorities, and requiring state forest action plans. Most programs are administered by the Forest Service but implemented by state partners.
3. To be eligible for funding, states must prepare State Forest Action Plans, conduct assessments, and establish Forest Stewardship Coordination Committees. Programs may offer technical assistance, financial aid, or both, with funding typically coming from discretionary appropriations. Funding for forestry assistance programs has decreased over the past 15 years, with the Administration proposing cuts to several programs in the FY2019 budget.

1. Transnational organized crime groups in Burma traffic contraband such as drugs, humans, guns, wildlife, gems, and timber, generating billions of dollars annually. Corruption among officials in the ruling military junta facilitates trafficking, providing immunity from law enforcement. The country's border regions share features of ""ungoverned spaces"" due to difficult terrain and ethnic tensions.

2. Congress has been active in U.S. policy toward Burma, imposing sanctions for issues related to transnational crime. Recent legislation, such as the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, strengthens sanctions against SPDC officials and prohibits the indirect import of Burmese gems. The U.S. State Department and other observers indicate widespread corruption among Burmese officials, including military involvement in drug trafficking.

3. Burma is a major drug-producing state, barred from U.S. foreign assistance under legislative provisions. The country is listed as a Tier 3 state for human trafficking, subject to sanctions. Burma's involvement in illegal activities extends to trafficking in wildlife, gems, small arms, and other contraband.

4. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on individuals and entities linked to drug trafficking in Burma. The country's involvement in money laundering and illicit financial activities poses risks. Burma's underdeveloped financial sector and informal money transfer networks contribute to its status as a money laundering risk.

5. Despite sanctions, the effectiveness of U.S. policies in Burma is limited by factors such as uneven international sanctions, booming natural gas industry revenue, and China's support. Sanctions have led to flourishing black markets and trafficking activities, impacting vulnerable populations. U.S. assistance to combat transnational crime in Burma focuses on training law enforcement officials in neighboring countries.

6. Policy makers are re-evaluating U.S. policy toward Burma in light of recent junta violence. Considerations include increasing humanitarian aid, leveraging multilateral dialogue through ASEAN, involving India and other regional players, and collaborating with China and Thailand to address transnational crime. The United States aims to address the challenges posed by transnational crime emanating from Burma through strategic partnerships and policy adjustments.

The incidence of delayed hemorrhage was significantly lower in the SMUPPP group compared to the tonsillectomy group. The technique of suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Bipolar cauterization followed by tacking with 3-0 vicryl sutures may have also contributed to reducing bleeding rates.

2. The study found that the rate of postoperative bleeding was higher in tonsillectomy patients whose muscular tissue of the tonsillar fossa was not approximated using interrupted 3-0 vicryl sutures. Suturing both layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP appeared to be an influencing factor in lowering the bleeding incidence. Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help in postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence. Submucosal tonsillectomy, a part of SMUPPP, was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative delayed hemorrhage in adult patients compared to tonsillectomy using unipolar cautery.

1. Delirium is a common and severe complication among elderly patients, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may shed light on the pathophysiology and improve delirium recognition and care.
2. Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission may be involved in the pathophysiology of delirium, with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) playing a crucial role as a cofactor for serotonin and dopamine production. BH4 deficiency, reflected in the phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio, was found in patients with delirium, suggesting a potential link to reduced serotonin and dopamine synthesis.
3. Patients with delirium also showed lower tryptophan/large neutral amino acids ratios, indicating reduced serotonin production, and lower levels of arginine and citrulline, suggesting increased oxidative stress. However, no significant differences were found in dopamine metabolite levels between patients with and without delirium.
4. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in a larger population and explore differences in the pathophysiology of delirium in patients with and without cognitive disorders. Understanding the role of BH4, neurotransmitter disturbances, and oxidative stress in delirium may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this common and serious condition in elderly patients.

1. The role of specific miRNAs, such as miR-200c, in cancer progression has been extensively studied, with findings indicating their involvement in regulating oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and pathways relevant to cancer. MiR-200c has been shown to repress ZEB1 and ZEB2, leading to a restoration of E-cadherin expression and a decrease in migration and invasion in cancer cells. Additionally, miR-200c has been implicated in increasing chemosensitivity to paclitaxel by targeting TUBB3, a protein associated with resistance to microtubule-targeting agents.

2. The reciprocal regulation between miR-200c and ZEB1 is not observed in all cell lines, suggesting variability in the feedback loop mechanism. While some cells show a decrease in proliferation and adhesion to substrates in response to miR-200c expression, others do not exhibit the same effects. Furthermore, the enhanced chemosensitivity to paclitaxel caused by miR-200c is independent of increased proliferation, indicating that the downregulation of TUBB3 is the primary mechanism behind the increased sensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents. Overall, miR-200c plays a crucial role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype and influencing various aspects of cancer progression.

1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence with midurethral sling placement was developed to reduce complications. Both inside-out and outside-in approaches have been studied, with similar cure rates reported. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both approaches from a neurovascular perspective. A cadaveric study compared the relationship between the tape and urethra in both approaches using CT scan image analysis.

2. The study found that the inside-out approach angulated around the urethra more acutely than the outside-in approach. The tapes were positioned posterior/dorsal to the urethra, rather than inferior, and were shown to be u-shaped bands heading backwards. The in-out trajectory had higher variability compared to the out-in trajectory, emphasizing the importance of strict adherence to operative technique. Radiographic visualization allowed for a better understanding of the tapes' spatial configuration in relation to the bony pelvis and urethra.

3. Clinical implications from the study suggest that surgeons must pay attention to the helical pass during both approaches. The in-out passage requires careful rotation around the ischiopubic ramus, while the out-in pass necessitates thorough dissection of the peri-urethral tunnel. Three-dimensional ultrasonography may provide dynamic measurements of tape trajectories in vivo, correlating findings to clinical outcomes. New approaches incorporating iron particles into implants may offer insights into mesh action mechanisms in the pelvic floor.

4. The study's limitations included the lack of correlation to clinical findings, as it was a cadaveric study. Clinical studies have reported differences in outcomes between the inside-out and outside-in approaches, with varying risks of complications. The study highlighted the importance of proper tape placement to avoid complications such as button-holing and dyspareunia. Future research using advanced imaging techniques may provide further insights into the effects of mesh in the pelvic floor.
