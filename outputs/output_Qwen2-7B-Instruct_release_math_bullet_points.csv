First, we need to find out how many calories are in each serving. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and totals 250 calories, we can calculate the calories per serving.

### Step 2. Calculate calories per serving
\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

### Step 3. Determine the remaining calorie target
Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after consuming 1800 calories. 

### Step 4. Calculate remaining calorie target
\[ \text{Remaining calorie target} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 5. Calculate servings based on remaining calories
Now, we need to figure out how many servings of 50 calories each can be consumed from the remaining 200 calories.

### Step 6. Calculate servings from remaining calories
\[ \text{Servings from remaining calories} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

### Step 7. Calculate grams per serving
To find out how many grams can be eaten per serving, we need to know the weight of the bag and the number of servings it contains.

### Step 8. Calculate grams per serving
Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving weighs:

\[ \text{Grams per serving} = \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

### Step 9. Calculate total grams that can be eaten

### Step 2. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life
After the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day. Assuming the puppy lives for a year after the first 180 days, the number of days for this period is \(365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days}\). The total amount of dog food needed for this period is \(2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}\).

### Step 3. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed in the first year
The total amount of dog food needed in the first year is the sum of the food needed for the first 180 days and the food needed for the rest of the year, which is \(180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}\).

First, calculate the total number of vacations Gene has been on. He started vacationing at 23 and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for \(34 - 23 = 11\) years.

### Step 2
Next, determine the number of vacations he goes on each year. He goes on \(4\) vacations a year.

### Step 3
Calculate the total number of vacations by multiplying the number of years by the number of vacations per year: \(11 \times 4 = 44\) vacations.

### Step 4
Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, Gene has \(44\) quilt blocks in total.

### Step 5
To confirm, we can also calculate the total number of blocks by considering the progression of years. Each year, he adds \(4\) blocks (one for each vacation), starting from \(0\) blocks at age \(23\). This forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 0\), the common difference \(d = 4\), and the number of terms \(n = 11\). The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(S = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)\).

### Step 6
Plugging in the values, we get \(S = \frac{11}{2} \times (2 \times 0 + (11 - 1) \times 4) = \frac{11}{2} \times (0 + 40) = \frac{11}{2} \times 40 = 11 \times 20 = 220\).

### Step 7
However, this calculation seems to have gone awry since it exceeds the expected total based on the direct calculation in Step 4. The correct approach is to simply multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year, as done in Step 4.

### Step 8
Given the direct calculation in Step 4, Gene has \(44\) quilt blocks in total.

### Step 9
To summarize, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is \(44\), derived from multiplying the number of years he has been vacationing by the number of vacations he goes on each year.

### Step 3
The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

### Step 4
To find out how many times the alarm rang in all, add the number of times it rang each time it went off: \(4 + 12 + 6\).

### Step 5
Calculate the total number of times the alarm rang: \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\).

### Step 6
Since the alarm is set to ring three times a day, and it went off three times today, we need to multiply the total number of times it rang by 3: \(22 \times 3\).

### Step 7
Calculate the total number of times the alarm rang considering it goes off three times a day: \(22 \times 3 = 66\).

### Step 8
However, this calculation assumes the alarm rings for the same duration each time it goes off, which is not specified in the question. The question only asks for the total number of times it rang, not the total duration.

Calculate the monthly increase amount: $600 * 0.10 = $60.

### Step 4
To find the annual salary increase, multiply the monthly increase by the number of months in a year: $60 * 12.

### Step 5
Calculate the annual salary increase: $60 * 12 = $720.

### Step 6
Add the annual salary increase to the initial salary to find Sylvie's new annual salary after 5 years of service: $600 * 12 + $720.

### Step 7
Calculate Sylvie's new annual salary after 5 years: $600 * 12 + $720 = $7200 + $720 = $7920.

### Step 8
Every year after the initial 5 years, Sylvie's salary increases by 10% of her current salary. Calculate the annual salary increase for the next 3 years.

### Step 9
For the first year after 5 years, the increase is 10% of $7920: $7920 * 0.10.

### Step 10
Calculate the increase for the first year: $7920 * 0.10 = $792.

### Step 11
Add the first year's increase to the salary from Step 7 to find the salary after the first year: $7920 + $792.

### Step 12
Calculate the salary after the first year: $7920 + $792 = $8712.

### Step 13
Repeat the process for the next two years, calculating the 10% increase of the salary from the previous year.

### Step 14
For the second year, the increase is 10% of $8712: $8712 * 0.10.

### Step 15
Calculate the increase for the second year: $8712 * 0.10 = $871.20.

### Step 16
Add the second year's increase to the salary from Step 12 to find the salary after the second year: $8712 + $871.20.

### Step 17
Calculate the salary after the second year: $8712 + $871.20 = $9583.20.

### Step 18
For the third year, the increase is 10% of $9583.20: $9583.20 * 0.10.

### Step 19
Calculate the increase for the third year: $9583.20 * 0.10 = $958.32.

### Step 20
Add the third year's increase to the salary from Step 16 to find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service: $9583.20 + $958.32.

### Step 21
Calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years: $9583.20 + $958.32 = $10541.52.

94,"### Step 1. Identify the given information
- Number of rabbits = Number of pet dogs + Number of cats - 12
- Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
- Number of dogs = 60

### Step 2. Calculate the number of cats
Given that there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs = 2 * 60 = 120

### Step 3. Calculate the number of rabbits
Using the information that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, we can find the number of rabbits:
Number of rabbits = Number of pet dogs + Number of cats - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168

### Step 4. Calculate the total number of pets
To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

If we denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \(y\), then Brittany's phone can hold \(50y\) photographs.

Given that Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour and had 8 hours to complete it, we can calculate the number of questions he completed as follows:

\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Questions completed in the first test} = 40 \]

**Step 2** **Calculating the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:**

Similarly, for the second test, where he completed at the same rate of 5 questions per hour but had 6 hours, we calculate:

\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = 5 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Questions completed in the second test} = 30 \]

**Step 3** **Calculating the number of questions left incomplete in each test:**

For the first test, the number of questions left incomplete is:

\[ \text{Questions left incomplete in the first test} = \text{Total questions in the first test} - \text{Questions completed in the first test} \]
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete in the first test} = 75 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete in the first test} = 35 \]

For the second test, the number of questions left incomplete is:

\[ \text{Questions left incomplete in the second test} = \text{Total questions in the second test} - \text{Questions completed in the second test} \]
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete in the second test} = 100 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete in the second test} = 70 \]

**Step 4** **Calculating the total number of questions left incomplete:**

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete across both tests, we sum the incomplete questions from each test:

\[ \text{Total questions left incomplete} = \text{Questions left incomplete in the first test} + \text{Questions left incomplete in the second test} \]
\[ \text{Total questions left incomplete} = 35 + 70 \]

To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount owed including interest.

### Step 2
First, calculate the monthly interest. The monthly interest rate is 2%, so the monthly interest on $100 is:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest} = \$100 \times \frac{2}{100} = \$2 \]

### Step 3
Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \$2 \times 3 = \$6 \]

### Step 4
Now, add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$100 + \$6 = \$106 \]

188,"### Step 1. Understanding the profit formula
The profit formula is: Profit = Revenue - Cost. In this case, the trader's profit is $400, and we need to find the number of bags sold.

### Step 2. Calculating total revenue
The total revenue is the selling price per bag times the number of bags sold. Let's denote the number of bags sold as \(x\). So, the total revenue is \(30x\).

### Step 3. Calculating total cost
The total cost includes the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transporting them. The cost of buying \(x\) bags is \(20x\), and the cost of transporting \(x\) bags is \(2x\). Therefore, the total cost is \(20x + 2x = 22x\).

### Step 4. Applying the profit formula
Using the profit formula, we have \(400 = 30x - 22x\). Simplifying this equation gives us \(400 = 8x\).

### Step 5. Solving for \(x\)
To find the number of bags sold (\(x\)), we divide both sides of the equation by 8: \(x = 400 / 8 = 50\).

The trader sold 50 bags of wheat to make a total profit of $400.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints6MathFormat'}

The total cost of the tickets is given as $20.25.

**Step 2** Calculate the cost of food.
The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. So, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides. So, the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

**Step 4** Calculate the total cost.
The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tickets, food, and rides. So, the total cost is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

**Step 2** **Calculating water loss**: Since both pools lose water at the same rate, the difference in their water levels is due to the difference in their initial volumes. Over 4 minutes, each pool loses \(4 \times 4 = 16\) gallons of water.

**Step 3** **Setting up equations**: Let \(x\) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, it has \(4x\) gallons. Four minutes ago, the big pool had \(4x + 16\) gallons and the small pool had \(x + 16\) gallons.

First, calculate the total number of slices needed. Since each of the 20 friends gets 4 slices, the total slices required are \(20 \times 4 = 80\) slices.

### Step 2
Next, determine how many slices are in each pizza. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, one pizza provides 8 slices.

### Step 3
To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, divide the total slices required by the number of slices per pizza. This gives \(80 \div 8 = 10\) pizzas.

### Step 4
Since you can't order a fraction of a pizza, and the calculation shows exactly 10 pizzas are needed, John must order 10 whole pizzas.

### Step 5
Double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy. \(10 \times 8 = 80\) slices, which matches the total slices required for 20 friends each having 4 slices.

### Step 6
Consider any potential for guests to eat more than one slice. Ordering an extra pizza would ensure there are enough slices for everyone, but based on the initial calculation, 10 pizzas are sufficient.

### Step 7
Account for any potential waste or leftovers. Ordering 10 pizzas is calculated to exactly meet the need, minimizing waste.

### Step 8
Finalize the order based on the calculations. John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.

First, calculate the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

### Step 2
Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys and girls combined is equal. Therefore, there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and 30 girls in the school.

### Step 3
Calculate the total number of girls in the first two classes. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls, making a total of \(15 + 12 = 27\) girls.

### Step 4
Subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class. \(30 - 27 = 3\) girls are in the third class.

### Step 5
Since the school is evenly split between boys and girls, and there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is the same as the number of girls in the third class, which is 3.

### Step 6
However, this calculation assumes that the gender distribution is consistent across all classes. Given the specific numbers provided, the number of boys in the third class is actually determined by the total number of students minus the number of girls in the third class.

### Step 7
Calculate the number of boys in the third class by subtracting the total number of girls in the school from the total number of students and then subtracting the number of girls in the third class. \(60 - 30 = 30\) boys in total, and since there are 3 girls in the third class, \(30 - 3 = 27\) boys are in the third class.

First, calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

### Step 2
To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, subtract 30% of Mitchel's count from Mitchel's count. 30% of 30 is \(30 \times 0.30 = 9\).

### Step 3
Anne went down the slide 30 times minus 9 times, which equals \(30 - 9 = 21\) times.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, and the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide the height by the section length to find the number of sections: \(200 \div 10 = 20\) sections.

### Step 2
Next, calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any of it. Multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: \(20 \times 400 = 8000\) pounds.

### Step 3
Determine the amount of wood eaten by the termites. Since they ate 30% of the tree, calculate 30% of the total weight: \(8000 \times 0.30 = 2400\) pounds.

We can substitute \(R = 6S\) from the first equation into the second equation to solve for \(S\):
\[6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)\]

### Step 4. Simplifying the equation
Simplifying the equation:
\[6S + 9 = 3S + 27\]

### Step 5. Solving for \(S\)
Subtract \(3S\) from both sides and subtract \(9\) from both sides to isolate \(S\):
\[6S - 3S = 27 - 9\]
\[3S = 18\]

Divide both sides by \(3\) to solve for \(S\):

First, calculate the total length of topaz gemstones used in a necklace. Since each necklace uses 8 topaz gemstones and each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand how the pages are arranged.

### Step 2
A typical tabloid or newspaper is printed on a single sheet of paper that is folded in half. This means that each sheet of paper contains two pages.

### Step 3
Since the tabloid has 32 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet to find out how many sheets are needed.

### Step 4
\[ \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

- \(5 \times $100 = $500\)
- \(+$700 = $1200\)

### Step 4. Calculate the total amount spent so far
The total spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket is:
- \( $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2050\)

### Step 5. Calculate the amount Theo wishes to save
Theo wishes to save $2000 for this trip.

### Step 6. Calculate the total amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts
The total amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts is the difference between his total budget and the amount he wishes to save plus the total amount already spent:
- \( $6000 - ($2000 + $2050) = $1950\)

### Final Result

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this number as follows:

- Total number of employees = 100
- Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \)

### Step 2. Calculate the number of senior programmers
Since the total number of employees is 100 and 40 of them are junior programmers, the remaining employees are senior programmers:

- Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

### Step 3. Calculate the monthly salary for senior programmers
Given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month:

- Monthly salary for senior programmers = Junior programmer salary + $400 = $2000 + $400 = $2400

### Step 4. Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers
To find the total monthly salary for all junior programmers, multiply the number of junior programmers by their monthly salary:

- Total monthly salary for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Junior programmer salary = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000

### Step 5. Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers
Similarly, calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:

- Total monthly salary for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Senior programmer salary = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000

### Step 6. Calculate the total amount paid to all programmers per month
Finally, add the total monthly salaries for both junior and senior programmers to find the total amount paid to all programmers per month:

- Total amount paid to all programmers = Total monthly salary for junior programmers + Total monthly salary for senior programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The problem involves dividing 200 students into 3 groups where 2 groups have the same number of students and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two.

Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits from her friend.

### Step 2
At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits from her friends, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) outfits.

### Step 3
Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

### Step 4
To find the total number of outfits, we add all the outfits together: \(24 + 48 + 15\).

### Step 5
Calculating the sum, we get \(24 + 48 = 72\).

### Step 6
Adding the 15 outfits from her mom, \(72 + 15 = 87\).

### Step 7
Thus, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is obtained by summing up all the outfits received.

### Step 8
The final calculation is \(24 + 48 + 15 = 87\).

### Step 9
Therefore, the answer is reached by combining all the outfits Laurel received.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \(x\). According to the problem, \(x = 3\).

### Step 2
The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those who refused to wear masks minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters is \(4x - 5\). Substituting \(x = 3\) into this equation gives us \(4 \times 3 - 5 = 7\).

### Step 3
The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, this number is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

### Step 4
The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is given as 50. We can set up an equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let's denote this number as \(y\). The equation is \(x + (4x - 5) + 21 + y = 50\).

### Step 5
Substituting \(x = 3\) into the equation gives us \(3 + (4 \times 3 - 5) + 21 + y = 50\), which simplifies to \(3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50\).

- Employees renewed in June = 40 employees * (3/4) = 30 employees

### Step 5
Calculate the total number of employees for June:

- Total employees in June = 40 employees - 10 employees (expired contracts) + 30 employees (renewed) = 60 employees

### Step 6
Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees in June:

- Total hours per employee in June = 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours
- Total hours for all employees in June = 60 employees * 160 hours/employee = 9,600 hours

### Step 7
Calculate the total amount paid to all employees in June:

- Total pay per employee in June = 160 hours * $15/hour = $2400
- Total pay for all employees in June = 60 employees * $2400/employee = $144,000

### Step 8
Finally, calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months:

- Total pay for May and June = $96,000 (May) + $144,000 (June) = $240,000

First, calculate the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees. Since she gathered half as many from the shortest trees as from the tallest trees, she gathered \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples from the shortest trees.

### Step 2
Next, calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees. Since she gathered twice as many as Joanne, she gathered \(30 * 2 = 60\) apples from the tallest trees.

### Step 3
Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the shortest trees. Since she gathered three times as many as Joanne, she gathered \(15 * 3 = 45\) apples from the shortest trees.

### Step 4
Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees combined. This is \(60 + 45 = 105\) apples.

### Step 5
Subtract the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the overall total to find out how many apples were gathered from the average trees. \(500 - 105 = 395\) apples were gathered from the average trees.

### Step 6
Since Joanne gathered more apples from the average trees than her sister, and we know the total number of apples gathered from the average trees, we can find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees by subtracting the number of apples her sister gathered from the average trees. However, we don't have the exact number of apples her sister gathered from the average trees. We can infer that since the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 395, and we know Joanne's sister didn't gather any from the average trees, Joanne must have gathered all 395 apples from the average trees.

2. \(2C + D = 304\) (total humps)

### Step 3
Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(D\):

440,"**Step 1** Understanding the problem, we know the area of the rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet and the length is given in yards. We need to convert the length from yards to feet to solve the problem.

**Step 2** Converting the length from yards to feet, we use the conversion factor 1 yard = 3 feet. So, if the length is 3 yards, it becomes 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

**Step 3** We know the area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: Width = Area / Length.

**Step 4** Plugging in the values we have, Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

**Step 5** Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

**Step 6** Substituting the values we have, Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

**Step 7** The answer is derived by performing the calculation step-by-step, ensuring that all units are consistent throughout the process.

**Step 8** We have converted the length from yards to feet, calculated the width using the area, and then used the perimeter formula to find the perimeter of the bedroom.

**Step 9** The final step is to state the answer clearly, without any extra units.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat as \(C\). According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. 

### Step 2
The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is given as 5. The equation based on the given conditions is: 
\[ \frac{C}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

### Step 3
To find \(C\), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{C}{2} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{C}{2} = 3 \]

### Step 4
Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \(C\):
\[ C = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ C = 6 \]

### Step 5
Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to satisfy the conditions set by his dad.

**Step 2** **Converting units**: First, we need to convert the shark's length into inches since the remoras' length is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is \(10 \times 12 = 120\) inches long.

**Step 3** **Calculating total remora length**: Each remora is 6 inches long, so the combined length of the 2 remoras is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.

**Step 4** **Finding the percentage**: To find what percentage the remoras' length is of the shark's length, we use the formula \(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \times 100\). Here, the part is the total length of the remoras (12 inches), and the whole is the shark's length (120 inches). So, the percentage is \(\frac{12}{120} \times 100 = 10\%\).

**Step 2** Since 20 students represent the one-fourth of students who do not have a desktop computer, we can find the total number of students by calculating how many times 20 fits into the whole.

**Step 3** To find the total number of students, we divide the number of students without a desktop computer (20) by the fraction that represents them (1/4). This gives us the total number of students.

The problem states that Heather has a bag of 27 cups of raisins and wants to divide them equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. It also mentions that a batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

### Step 2. Calculating the total raisins per batch
To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount required for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

### Step 3. Dividing the total raisins
Given that Heather has 27 cups of raisins and each batch of oatmeal cookies uses 3/4 cup of raisins, we calculate the number of batches as follows:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total raisins}}{\text{Raisins per batch}} = \frac{27}{\frac{3}{4}} \]

### Step 4. Simplifying the calculation
To simplify the division, we can multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

### Step 5. Performing the multiplication
\[ \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 36 \]

Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies using the raisins from the jumbo bag, assuming she divides the raisins equally among the three recipes.

Calculate the rate of work per day for one person. Since it takes 10 days to paint a whole house, one person paints \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the house per day.

### Step 3
Find the rate of work per day for 5 people. Since each person paints \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the house per day, 5 people together paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of the house per day.

The problem states that Elvis aims to save $1125 in a month and wants to divide this saving equally between the first and second halves of the month. Additionally, he plans to save twice as much daily in the second half compared to the first half.

### Step 2. Calculating total savings for the first half
Since the total monthly saving target is $1125 and it's divided equally between the two halves, the savings for the first half would be $1125 / 2 = $562.5.

### Step 3. Calculating total savings for the second half
Given that Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, the total savings for the second half would be 2 * $562.5 = $1125.

### Step 4. Determining the number of days in each half
Assuming a month has 30 days, the first half would have 15 days and the second half would also have 15 days.

### Step 5. Calculating daily savings for the second half
To find out how much Elvis needs to save daily in the second half, divide the total savings for the second half by the number of days in the second half: $1125 / 15 = $75.

To find out how much Jeff gets, we first need to understand the relationship between Jeff's and Brad's shares. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

### Step 2
Let's denote Brad's share as \(B\) and Jeff's share as \(J\). According to the problem, \(J = 4B\).

### Step 3
We also know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars. Therefore, \(B + J = 100\).

### Step 4
Substituting \(J = 4B\) into the equation \(B + J = 100\), we get \(B + 4B = 100\).

### Step 5
Combining like terms, we have \(5B = 100\).

### Step 6
To find Brad's share, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: \(B = \frac{100}{5} = 20\).

### Step 7
Now that we know Brad's share is 20 dollars, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying Brad's share by 4: \(J = 4 \times 20 = 80\).

### Step 8
Jeff gets 80 dollars in this scenario.

The bag initially contains 21 buttons.

There are 7 buttons with two holes each.

First, we need to find out the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting. This is done by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then dividing by the actual temperature, and finally multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

- Difference: \(468 - 450 = 18\)
- Percentage error: \(\frac{18}{468} \times 100 = 3.85\%\)

### Step 2. Apply the percentage error to the desired temperature
Next, we apply this percentage error to the desired temperature of 520 degrees to find the correct setting on the oven.

- Desired temperature: 520 degrees
- Percentage error: 3.85%

### Step 3. Calculate the correct setting
To find the correct setting, we subtract the percentage error from 100% and then apply this to the desired temperature.

- Correct setting percentage: \(100\% - 3.85\% = 96.15\%\)

### Step 4. Calculate the actual temperature setting
Finally, we calculate the actual temperature setting by applying the correct setting percentage to the desired temperature.

- Actual setting: \(520 \times 0.9615 = 499.02\)

First, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the discount. 

### Step 2
Each box costs $100.00, so 2 boxes cost $100.00 * 2 = $200.00.

### Step 3
Apply the 10% discount to the total cost. 10% of $200.00 is $200.00 * 0.10 = $20.00.

### Step 4
Subtract the discount from the total cost: $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00.

### Step 5
Divide the total cost by the number of contacts to find the cost per contact. Pete gets 90 contacts per box, so 2 boxes give him 90 * 2 = 180 contacts.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \(B\). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \(1\%\) fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is \(1\%\) more than the number of blue jelly beans.

### Step 2: Express Red and Green Jelly Beans in Terms of Blue Jelly Beans
- Red jelly beans: \(B - 0.01B = 0.99B\)
- Green jelly beans: \(B + 0.01B = 1.01B\)

### Step 3: Sum Up All Jelly Beans
The total number of jelly beans is given as \(4500\). Therefore, the equation to represent the total number of jelly beans is:

The problem states that the beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

### Step 2: Setting up the equation
Let's denote the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet as \(d\). The height of the beanstalk after \(d\) days can be represented as \(4 \times 2^d\), since it doubles every day.

### Step 3: Creating the inequality
We need to find \(d\) such that \(4 \times 2^d > 20\).

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us \(2^d > 5\).

### Step 5: Solving for \(d\)

To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to determine the relative speed between Tom and Bob. 

### Step 2
Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour, and Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour.

### Step 3
The initial distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the initial distance by the relative speed.

The time it takes for Tom to catch up is \(75 \div 15 = 5\) hours.

First, calculate the total number of people in the group. Aiden and 12 friends initially, then they meet up with 7 more friends.

Total people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 friends = 21 people

### Step 2
Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 21 people, there are 21 seats.

### Step 3
Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed. Each seat requires two drinks and three snacks.

Total drinks = 21 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 42 drinks
Total snacks = 21 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 63 snacks

### Step 4
Drinks and snacks cost $2 each. Calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks.

Total cost for drinks = 42 drinks * $2/drink = $84
Total cost for snacks = 63 snacks * $2/snack = $126

### Step 5
Add the total cost for drinks and snacks to find the overall amount spent.

First, calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, we add 800 pounds to Gissela's truck capacity.

### Step 2
Gissela's truck capacity is 4,000 pounds. Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity is \(4,000 + 800 = 4,800\) pounds.

### Step 3
Next, determine the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. We add their capacities together: \(4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800\) pounds.

The problem states that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this, 80% is used for industrial purposes. We need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

### Step 2. Calculating the industrial usage
First, we calculate the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes by Colorado City. This is given as 40% of the total water, and 80% of this industrial usage is for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage percentage is \(40\% \times 80\% = 32\%\).

### Step 3. Calculating the non-industrial usage
Next, we find the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes by Colorado City. This is the remainder of the water used by the city after accounting for industrial usage. Since 32% is used for industrial purposes, \(40\% - 32\% = 8\%\) is used for non-industrial purposes.

First, determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 \]

### Step 2
Substitute Boris's apples (100) into the equation:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 \]

### Step 3
Calculate the result:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 77 \]

### Step 4
Next, calculate how many apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck:

### Step 2. Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading 27 small stickers.
Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons in return.

The problem states that the regulation passed with twice as many votes in favor as against. This means for every vote against, there are two votes in favor.

### Step 2. Setting up the equation

Ava gets 10 points per enemy, Emma gets 10 points per enemy, Ava gets 5 points per berry, Emma gets 5 points per berry, and both get 30 points for every second left on the timer.

2. **Calculating points for enemies jumped on**: Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. If Emma jumps on \(E\) enemies, then Ava jumps on \(E + 8\) enemies. Points for enemies jumped on are \(10 \times (E + 8)\) for Ava and \(10 \times E\) for Emma.

3. **Calculating points for berries collected**: Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. If Emma collects \(B\) berries, then Ava collects \(B + 3\) berries. Points for berries collected are \(5 \times (B + 3)\) for Ava and \(5 \times B\) for Emma.

4. **Calculating points for seconds left on the timer**: Both finish the level 4 seconds slower than the timer ends. Points for seconds left are \(30 \times 4\) for both, as the difference in time does not affect the points.

5. **Calculating total scores**: Ava's total score is \(10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times 4\), and Emma's total score is \(10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times 4\).

To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we first need to calculate the total cost of each item.

### Step 2
The cost of 3 loaves of bread is calculated by multiplying the cost of one loaf by 3. 

### Step 3
The cost of 2 bagels is calculated by multiplying the cost of one bagel by 2.

### Step 4
Let's calculate the total cost for each item:
- Cost of 3 loaves of bread = 3 * $2 = $6
- Cost of 2 bagels = 2 * $1 = $2

### Step 5
Now, we subtract the total cost of the 2 bagels from the total cost of the 3 loaves of bread to find out how much more the bread costs.

### Step 6
The difference in cost = Cost of 3 loaves of bread - Cost of 2 bagels = $6 - $2 = $4

### Step 2
To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy for the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we first need to understand that the total number of stuffed animals after buying goats will be the sum of the current stuffed animals and the new goats.

### Step 3
Let's denote the number of goats Bubbles needs to buy as \(G\). The total number of stuffed animals after buying goats will be \(14 + G\).

### Step 4
According to the problem, the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30% of all stuffed animals. This can be represented as:

\[ \frac{G}{14 + G} = 0.30 \]

### Step 5
Solving the equation for \(G\):

\[ G = 0.30 \times (14 + G) \]

\[ G = 4.2 + 0.30G \]

\[ G - 0.30G = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70G = 4.2 \]

First, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain. Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, we multiply 1 inch by 12.

### Step 2
Next, we determine how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain. Given that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, we multiply the height Saskay can lift by 4.

### Step 3
After finding out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, we calculate Naruto's lifting capacity. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so we multiply the height Kagiyami can lift by 10.

### Step 4
To convert the height Naruto can lift from inches to feet, we need to know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. We divide the height Naruto can lift in inches by 12 to get the height in feet.

### Step 5
Let's calculate the height Naruto can lift in inches first. Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and the height scales up by factors, we multiply 1 inch by 12 (Saskay's factor), then by 4 (Kagiyami's factor), and finally by 10 (Naruto's factor).

### Step 6
After calculating the height Naruto can lift in inches, we convert it to feet by dividing by 12.

### Step 7
Let's perform the calculations:

1. Height Saskay can lift = 1 inch * 12 = 12 inches
2. Height Kagiyami can lift = 12 inches * 4 = 48 inches
3. Height Naruto can lift = 48 inches * 10 = 480 inches

The problem involves comparing the travel times of kangaroos and turtles. We know the total time taken by 3 kangaroos and need to find the time taken by 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo.

### Step 2. Kangaroos' travel time
Given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can infer that the total travel time is directly proportional to the number of kangaroos, assuming they all travel at the same speed.

### Step 3. Speed relationship between kangaroos and turtles
The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. This implies that the time taken to travel the same distance by a turtle is twice that taken by a kangaroo.

### Step 4. Calculating turtle travel time
Since the speed of the turtles is half that of the kangaroos, the time taken by a turtle to travel the same distance is twice that taken by a kangaroo. Therefore, if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, a single kangaroo would take \(18 \times 3 = 54\) hours to cross the highway.

### Step 5. Calculating time for 4 turtles
Given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, a single turtle would take \(54 \times 2 = 108\) hours to cross the highway. Since there are 4 turtles, the total time taken by all 4 turtles would be \(108 \times 4 = 432\) hours.

The problem involves calculating the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years from an initial investment, considering simple interest. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step 2. Identifying the formula for simple interest
The formula for calculating simple interest is: 
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

### Step 3. Calculating the annual interest
Given the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, the rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75. The principal amount is $300. Thus, the annual interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 = 225 \]

To find out the total number of glue sticks required, multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student: \(27 \times 2 = 54\) glue sticks.

### Step 2. Determine packs needed
Next, divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed: \(54 \div 8 = 6.75\) packs.

### Step 3. Round up to whole packs
Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks, he must round up to the nearest whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs.

### Step 4. Calculate extra glue sticks
To find out how many extra glue sticks Mr. Jackson will have, multiply the number of packs he buys by the number of glue sticks per pack and subtract the total number of glue sticks needed: \(7 \times 8 - 54 = 56 - 54 = 2\) extra glue sticks.

To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob.

### Step 2
Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it is 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the whatchamacallit's speed by 11.

### Step 3
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \, \text{m/s}}{11} = 11 \, \text{m/s} \]

### Step 4
Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

**Step 2** **Calculating total time spent per berry**: Since the sloth spends 4 hours for each trip, and we want to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we first calculate how many trips it can make in 8 hours. This is done by dividing the total available time (8 hours) by the time spent per trip (4 hours).

**Step 3** **Determining the number of trips**: \( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \)

**Step 4** **Calculating berries per trip**: To find out the least number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries needed (24) by the number of trips (2).

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the 12-hour stay
The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay.

### Step 4: Calculate the additional hours Cameron will stay
Cameron will stay for 17 hours, so the additional hours are 17 - 12 = 5 hours.

The relationships between the number of Pokemon caught by each are given as follows: Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

**Step 2** **Setting up equations**: Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \(A\), Stan as \(S\), and Alex as \(A_x\). From the given information, we can set up the following equations:
1. \(A + S + A_x = 339\)
2. \(A_x = S + 5\)
3. \(S = 4A - 13\)

**Step 3** **Substituting and solving**: We can substitute equation 2 into equation 1 to express everything in terms of \(A\):
\[A + S + (S + 5) = 339\]
\[A + 2S + 5 = 339\]
\[A + 2(4A - 13) + 5 = 339\]
\[A + 8A - 26 + 5 = 339\]
\[9A - 21 = 339\]

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, and there needs to be a 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) gap between each plant. So, the space needed for each plant including the gap is 12 inches (for the plant) + 18 inches (for the gap) = 30 inches.

### Step 3: Calculate the total space needed for all plants
To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space needed for each plant. So, 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we can only fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of additional plants needed
Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost
Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is 27 plants * $6/plant = $162.

First, calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats daily. Since he eats half as many as Edgar, we divide Edgar's daily intake by 2.

### Step 2
Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. So, his brother eats \(18 \div 2 = 9\) pretzels a day.

### Step 3
Next, calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7.

### Step 4
His brother eats \(9 \times 7 = 63\) pretzels in a week.

### Step 5
This calculation assumes that the brother's consumption pattern remains constant throughout the week.

### Step 6
The result is derived by understanding the relationship between Edgar's and his brother's consumption and applying basic arithmetic operations.

### Step 7
The calculation takes into account the given information that his brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar does daily.

### Step 8
By following the steps, we ensure that the calculation is accurate and logically sound.

First, we need to calculate the total weight of the flowers that require soil. Sunflowers need 3 pounds each and there are 4 of them, while carnations need 1.5 pounds each and there are 10 of them.

### Step 2. Calculate the total weight of sunflowers
\[4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}\]

### Step 3. Calculate the total weight of carnations
\[10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}\]

991,"**Step 1** **Understanding the problem**: We know that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

**Step 2** **Calculating the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time**: Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw it when he was 30, the second sighting would be 75 years after the first. Therefore, Bill's dad was \(30 + 75 = 105\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

**Step 3** **Determining the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time**: Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet for the second time. So, Bill was \(3 \times 105 = 315\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

**Step 4** **Calculating the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time**: Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the first sighting would be 75 years before the second sighting. Therefore, Bill was \(315 - 75 = 240\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Step 5** **Verifying the solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, we can check if the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time (30 years) aligns with the given conditions. Indeed, 75 years later, when Bill's dad was 105 years old, Bill would have been \(240 - 75 = 165\) years old, which is not possible. This discrepancy arises from an incorrect interpretation of the problem. The correct approach should consider the age difference between the first and second sightings, not the absolute age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time.

**Step 6** **Correcting the approach**: The correct approach should focus on the age difference between the first and second sightings. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw it when he was 30, the second sighting would be 75 years after the first. Therefore, the age difference between the first and second sightings is 75 years. If Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we need to find the age difference between the first and second sightings in terms of Bill's age.

**Step 7** **Re-calculating the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time**: Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, and the age difference between the first and second sightings is 75 years, we need to find the age difference in terms of Bill's age. Let \(x\) be the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, \(3x - x = 75\), which simplifies to \(2x = 75\). Solving for \(x\) gives \(x = 37.5\).

First, determine the number of laps Trey can run. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, and Bethany can run 10 laps, Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.

### Step 2
Next, calculate the number of laps Shaelyn can run. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so she can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.

### Step 3
Then, find out how many laps Quinn can run. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, which means Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

### Step 4
Finally, to determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. Bethany can run \(10 - 5 = 5\) more laps than Quinn.

### Final Result
The answer is: Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

1012,"**Step 1** **Understanding the problem**: We need to find the initial charge of the power bank. We know the rate of charge loss changes over time and the final charge.

**Step 2** **Analyzing the rate of charge loss**: In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour. In the next 3 hours, the rate drops to 7% per hour. The final charge is 28%.

**Step 3** **Calculating the charge after the first 5 hours**: Let's denote the initial charge as \(X\). After 5 hours, the charge would be \(X - 5 \times 0.09X = X(1 - 0.45) = 0.55X\).

**Step 4** **Calculating the charge after the next 3 hours**: After the next 3 hours, the charge would be \(0.55X - 3 \times 0.07 \times 0.55X = 0.55X(1 - 0.21) = 0.55X \times 0.79\).

**Step 5** **Setting up the equation**: We know the final charge is 28%, or 0.28 of the initial charge. So, \(0.55X \times 0.79 = 0.28X\).

**Step 6** **Solving for \(X\)**: Simplify the equation to find \(X\). \(0.55 \times 0.79X = 0.28X\), which simplifies to \(0.4345X = 0.28X\). Solving for \(X\) gives \(X = \frac{0.28}{0.4345} \approx 0.645\).

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in the box. Anne's box contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is \(15 \times 60\).

### Step 2. Calculate pieces kept by Anne
Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack has 60 pieces, she kept \(2 \times 60\) pieces.

### Step 3. Calculate pieces given to friends
To find out how many pieces Anne gave to her friends, we subtract the pieces she kept from the total pieces in the box. This is \(15 \times 60 - 2 \times 60\).

### Step 4. Calculate pieces per friend
Anne gave the rest of the sweets equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given to friends by the number of friends, which is \(10\).

### Step 5. Perform calculations
- Total pieces in the box: \(15 \times 60 = 900\)
- Pieces kept by Anne: \(2 \times 60 = 120\)

First, convert Xavier's growth from inches to feet to compare with Cole's height. There are 12 inches in a foot.

### Step 2
Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer. To convert this to feet: \(3 \, \text{inches} \div 12 = 0.25 \, \text{feet}\).

### Step 3
Xavier's original height was 4 feet. After growing 0.25 feet, his new height is \(4 \, \text{feet} + 0.25 \, \text{feet} = 4.25 \, \text{feet}\).

### Step 4
Cole's original height was 50 inches. Convert this to feet: \(50 \, \text{inches} \div 12 = 4.1667 \, \text{feet}\).

### Step 5
Cole grew 2 inches over the summer. Convert this to feet: \(2 \, \text{inches} \div 12 = 0.1667 \, \text{feet}\).

### Step 6
Cole's new height is \(4.1667 \, \text{feet} + 0.1667 \, \text{feet} = 4.3334 \, \text{feet}\).

### Step 7
To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, subtract Cole's height from Xavier's height: \(4.25 \, \text{feet} - 4.3334 \, \text{feet}\).

### Step 8
The difference in height is \(-0.0834 \, \text{feet}\), indicating Xavier is taller by this amount.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as \(x\). 

### Step 2
According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so their share is \(x + 80\).

### Step 3
The third person took twice what the second took, which means their share is \(2(x + 80)\).

### Step 4
The total amount divided among the three is $1920. So, we can write the equation: \(x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\).

### Step 5
Simplifying the equation, we get: \(x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\).

### Step 6
Combining like terms, we have: \(4x + 240 = 1920\).

### Step 7
Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get: \(4x = 1680\).

To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

### Step 2
The annual depreciation rate is 21%. This means each year, the car's value is 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

### Step 3
The initial price of the car is $20,000. We will apply the depreciation rate for each year from 2007 to 2010.

### Step 4
For 2008, the price of the car is $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800.

### Step 5
For 2009, the price of the car is $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,582.

### Step 6
For 2010, the price of the car is $12,582 * 0.79 = $9,958.78.

### Step 7
We calculate the price for each year by multiplying the previous year's price by 0.79.

### Step 8
After calculating the depreciation for each year, we find the price of the car in 2010.

### Step 9
The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,958.78.

**Step 2** **Calculating Maggie's initial amount**: Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and ended up with $60, this means $60 is three-quarters of her initial amount. We can calculate her initial amount by dividing $60 by 3 and then multiplying by 4.

**Step 3** **Calculating Riza's initial amount**: Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money and ended up with $60, which means $60 is two-thirds of her initial amount. We can calculate her initial amount by dividing $60 by 2 and then multiplying by 3.

**Step 4** **Calculating the total initial amount**: After finding out the initial amounts for Maggie and Riza, we add them together to get the total initial amount they had together.

**Step 5** **Calculating the total spent**: We calculate the total amount spent by Maggie and Riza by subtracting the final amount ($60 each) from their initial amounts.

**Step 6** **Calculating the total amount left**: Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the total initial amount to find out how much money they have left together.

**Step 7** **Performing calculations**:
- **Maggie's initial amount**: $60 / 3 * 4 = $80
- **Riza's initial amount**: $60 / 2 * 3 = $90
- **Total initial amount**: $80 + $90 = $170
- **Total amount spent**: ($80 - $60) + ($90 - $60) = $20 + $30 = $50

The problem involves calculating the total time James spent walking to the store and back home due to forgetting something.

### Step 2. Calculating the distance for each leg of the journey
James walks a total distance of 4 miles to the store and 4 miles back home, making it 8 miles in total.

### Step 3. Calculating the time for each leg of the journey
Given James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time taken for each leg of the journey can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the store: time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour
For the return: time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

### Step 4. Calculating the total time
The total time spent walking is the sum of the time taken to reach the store and the time taken to return home.

Calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she buys 10 bunches, the total cost is \(10 \times 3.00 = \$30.00\).

### Step 4
To find out how much money Jenny saved, subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually. The savings are \(32.00 - 30.00 = \$2.00\).

She initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

### Step 2. Return of an item
She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

### Step 3. Sale of frying pan
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount is 20/100 * $20.00 = $4.00. So, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

### Step 4. Sale of set of towels
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. The discount is 10/100 * $30.00 = $3.00. So, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

### Step 5. Additional purchases
She bought the frying pan for $16.00 and the set of towels for $27.00, so the total additional cost is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

### Step 6. Final balance

When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. We need to find out the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

**Step 2** **Calculating the number of large jellyfish that change color**: Since a third of the large jellyfish change color and we know that 6 jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation \( \frac{1}{3} \times \text{number of large jellyfish} = 6 \). Solving for the number of large jellyfish gives us \( \text{number of large jellyfish} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

**Step 3** **Calculating the total number of large jellyfish**: Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can set up the equation \( \frac{1}{5} \times \text{total number of jellyfish} = 18 \).

**Step 2** Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted as \(A\) and the number of eggs Camden and Sarah painted as \(C\) and \(S\) respectively. We know that \(A = M\) and \(C + S = 30\). Also, \(C = S + 12\).

**Step 3** Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say that \(2A = A + M = 56 - (C + S)\). Given \(C + S = 30\), we can substitute to find \(2A = 56 - 30 = 26\), so \(A = 13\).

**Step 4** Knowing \(A = 13\), and since \(A = M\), Madeline also painted 13 eggs. 

**Step 5** Now, we need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted. Since \(C + S = 30\) and \(C = S + 12\), we can substitute \(C\) in the equation to get \(S + 12 + S = 30\). Simplifying, we get \(2S + 12 = 30\), which leads to \(2S = 18\) and \(S = 9\).

- \( 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \)

### Step 3. Calculate the total weight of the boxes
Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 25 groups, the total weight of the boxes is:

- \( 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \)

### Step 4. Calculate the combined weight in ounces
To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we add their weights together:

- \( 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \)

### Step 5. Convert the total weight to pounds
Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to convert it to pounds:

- \( \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \)

1133,"### Step 1
First, let's determine the time Grandma spends walking on the sidewalk. Since she spends 40 minutes on the beach and the total walk is 3 miles, the remaining time for the sidewalk walk is \(3 \times 60 - 40 = 140\) minutes.

### Step 2
Given that Grandma walks on the beach at a certain speed and on the sidewalk at twice that speed, let's denote the time spent walking on the beach as \(T_b\) and on the sidewalk as \(T_s\). We know \(T_b = 40\) minutes and \(T_s = 140\) minutes. The total time spent walking is \(T_b + T_s = 180\) minutes.

### Step 3
Since the sidewalk walk is twice the speed of the beach walk, the distance covered on the sidewalk in the same time is half. Therefore, if \(D_b\) is the distance covered on the beach, \(D_s = 2D_b\). Given \(D_b + D_s = 3\) miles, we can substitute \(D_s\) with \(2D_b\) to get \(D_b + 2D_b = 3\) miles, leading to \(3D_b = 3\) miles, so \(D_b = 1\) mile and \(D_s = 2\) miles.

### Step 4
Knowing \(D_b = 1\) mile and \(T_b = 40\) minutes, we can find the speed on the beach as \(Speed_b = \frac{D_b}{T_b} = \frac{1}{40}\) miles per minute.

### Step 5
Since the sidewalk speed is twice the beach speed, \(Speed_s = 2 \times Speed_b = \frac{1}{20}\) miles per minute.

### Step 6
To find the time spent walking on the sidewalk, we use the formula \(Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed}\). For the sidewalk, \(Time_s = \frac{D_s}{Speed_s} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{20}} = 40\) minutes.

### Step 7
The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which we've already calculated as \(180\) minutes.

### Final Result
Grandma completes the entire 3-mile walk in \boxed{180} minutes.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \(Y\), the blue rope as \(B\), and the red rope as \(R\).

### Step 2. Express relationships
From the problem, we have:
- \(R = 4B\)
- \(B = Y - 7\)
- \(R + B + Y = 37\)

### Step 3. Substitute relationships into the equation
Substituting \(R\) and \(B\) in terms of \(Y\) into the total length equation:
- \(4B + B + (B + 7) = 37\)

First, let's determine the total parts of the mural based on the given information. The mural is divided into red, white, purple, and yellow parts.

### Step 2
Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, this means these three colors together make up 3 parts of the mural. 

### Step 3
It's also mentioned that half the mural is yellow. This means the yellow paint makes up 2 parts of the mural.

**Step 2** **Calculating total treats**: Each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats Carly needs to make is: Total treats = 2 * 5 = 10.

**Step 3** **Setting up the equation**: Since each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people, the total treats (10) is equal to the sum of cupcakes and brownies. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. So, we have: C + B = 10.

**Step 4** **Substituting the relationship between brownies and cupcakes**: Using the relationship from Step 1, we can substitute B in the equation from Step 3. So, C + (3 * C - 2) = 10.

**Step 5** **Solving for C**: Simplify the equation: 4 * C - 2 = 10. Add 2 to both sides: 4 * C = 12. Divide by 4: C = 3.

The problem involves calculating the total number of grapes at the beginning based on the given actions: Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 times as many grapes to make juice, and their mother used the rest to make 4 pies, each requiring 12 grapes.

### Step 2. Calculating grapes used by brother
Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which means he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes for the juice.

### Step 3. Calculating total grapes used before pies
Before making pies, the total number of grapes used was Madeline's grapes plus her brother's, which is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.

### Step 4. Calculating grapes used for pies
The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the total grapes used for pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

### Step 5. Calculating total grapes at the beginning
To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used for juice and pies. However, since the calculation for the total used before pies (36 grapes) does not account for the pies, we need to adjust our approach. The total grapes used for pies (48 grapes) should be added to the grapes used for juice (30 grapes) to find the total used before making pies. This gives us \(30 + 48 = 78\) grapes used before making pies.

### Step 6. Considering Madeline's initial grapes
Since Madeline initially ate 6 grapes, and these were part of the total, we need to add these back to the total used before making pies. Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(78 + 6 = 84\) grapes.

### Final Result
The total number of grapes at the beginning was \boxed{84} grapes.",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.

**Step 4** Calculate the total amount of water needed for the plants that need 1 cup of water.
- Each of these 8 plants needs 1 cup of water.
- Total water needed = 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups.

**Step 5** Calculate the total number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
- Crista has 20 plants in total.
- 4 plants need half a cup of water (already accounted for).
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water (already accounted for).
- Remaining plants = 20 total plants - 4 half-cup plants - 8 one-cup plants = 8 plants.

**Step 6** Calculate the total amount of water needed for the plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
- Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
- Total water needed = 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups.

**Step 7** Calculate the total amount of water needed for all plants.
- Total water needed = water for half-cup plants + water for one-cup plants + water for quarter-cup plants.
- Total water needed = 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

**Step 8** Summarize the total amount of water needed for Crista's plants.
- Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

1256,"### Step 1. Understanding the problem
The problem involves calculating the time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home after being washed away by a rainstorm. The distance to his home is 200 yards, with half of it being on land and the other half in water.

### Step 2. Calculating the distance for each mode of transportation
Since the total distance is 200 yards and half of it is on land, the distance Phineas Frog will hop on land is 100 yards. Similarly, the distance he will swim through water is also 100 yards.

### Step 3. Calculating the time for each mode of transportation
To find the time it takes for each part of the journey, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.

- **Hopping on land**: Time = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.
- **Swimming through water**: Time = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

### Step 4. Summing up the total time
To find the total time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we add the time taken for hopping on land and swimming through water.

- **Total time** = Time hopping + Time swimming = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) holes.

The problem involves finding the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm given the total number of animals and legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

### Step 2. Setting up equations
Let's denote the number of chickens as \(C\) and the number of cows as \(K\). We have two equations based on the information provided:
1. \(C + K = 20\) (total number of animals)
2. \(2C + 4K = 70\) (total number of legs)

### Step 3. Simplifying the second equation
We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[C + 2K = 35\]

### Step 4. Subtracting equations
Subtract the first equation from the simplified second equation to eliminate \(C\):
\[C + 2K - (C + K) = 35 - 20\]

### Step 5. Finding the number of chickens
Substitute \(K = 15\) into the first equation to find \(C\):
