- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
- If we denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as `n`, then at the green house she sold `n/3` cleaners.

**Step 2: Calculate how many vacuum cleaners Melanie sold in total**
- After the green house, she sold 2 more at the red house.
- So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold after the green and red houses is `n/3 + 2`.

**Step 3: Determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie had left before the orange house**
- Half of what was left after the green and red houses was sold at the orange house.
- This means that before the orange house, Melanie had `2 * (n/3 + 2)` vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 4: Set up an equation based on the information given**
- Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house.
- Therefore, `n/3 + 2 * (n/3 + 2) = n - 5`.

**Step 5: Solve the equation for `n`**
- First, distribute the `2` in the left side of the equation: `n/3 + 2n/3 + 4 = n - 5`.

The problem states that there are two trains leaving from San Rafael and they travel in the same direction (westward) for a certain distance, then the next day, they travel in another direction (northwards) for a certain distance. We are asked to find the total distance each train has covered in these two days.

### Step 2: Find the westward distance
Each train travels westward for 80 miles. Since both trains leave at the same time and travel the same distance, their westward distance covered is equal.

- Train 1's westward distance = 80 miles
- Train 2's westward distance = 80 miles

### Step 3: Find the northward distance
The next day, both trains travel northwards for 150 miles. Again, since they travel the same distance, their northward distance covered is equal.

- Train 1's northward distance = 150 miles
- Train 2's northward distance = 150 miles

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance for each train
To find the total distance each train has traveled, we simply add their westward and northward distances.

- Train 1's total distance = westward distance + northward distance = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles
- Train 2's total distance = westward distance + northward distance = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

3. Comparing the total calories in the bag of chips (1250 calories) with the calories you have left (200 calories), you can see that eating the whole bag would exceed your daily calorie target.

5. Therefore, even though eating a whole serving might be too much, you could still eat a portion of a serving, as long as it fits within your remaining calorie budget.
6. To determine the exact number of grams you can eat, divide your remaining calorie budget by the number of calories per gram in the chips. The chips have `250 calories / 100g = 2.5 calories/g`.

64," 1. **Current Fuel Efficiency.** Sophia has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed 4 gallons to fill it up again. This means she has used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles.

2. **Calculating Fuel Efficiency.** To find out her car's fuel efficiency, we need to divide the distance traveled by the amount of fuel used. So, Sophia's car's fuel efficiency is 100 miles / 4 gallons = **25 miles/gallon**.

3. **Available Fuel.** The owner's manual states that Sophia's car has a 12-gallon fuel tank. However, we don't know how much fuel is currently in the tank.

4. **Assuming Full Tank.** To calculate the maximum distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we'll assume that the tank is currently full.

5. **Calculating Maximum Distance.** With a full tank, Sophia's car can hold 12 gallons of gas. Given her car's fuel efficiency of 25 miles/gallon, she can drive 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon = **300 miles**.

6. **Considering Real-World Factors.** In real-world scenarios, factors like driving behavior, traffic conditions, and vehicle maintenance can affect fuel efficiency. Therefore, Sophia might not always achieve the maximum distance of 300 miles.

7. **Checking Actual Fuel Level.** If Sophia wants a more accurate estimation, she should check her car's current fuel level and adjust the calculation accordingly.

8. **Considering Fuel Reserves.** Additionally, it's essential to keep some fuel in the reserve for emergencies. So, Sophia should consider subtracting a small percentage (e.g., 10%) from the calculated maximum distance.

9. **Final Considerations.** Other factors, like the car's age, condition, and the type of fuel used, can also impact the overall distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

10. **Final Result.** Based on the given information, and assuming a full tank, Sophia can drive up to \boxed{300} miles on a single tank of gas.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}

First, we need to find the square footage of each level in the sandcastle.

### 2
Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level starting from the top.

### 3
The top level has a square footage of 16. The level below it will have twice the area, so it is 16 \* 2 = 32 square feet.

### 4
The next level below that will have twice the area of the second level, so it is 32 \* 2 = 64 square feet.

### 5
The final level, which is the base, will have twice the area of the third level, so it is 64 \* 2 = 128 square feet.

### 6
Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does**
Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, Raymond does (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8 of the laundry that David does.

To find the total cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3, we first need to determine how many packages of 3 flowers are needed. This can be calculated by dividing the number of flowers needed by the number of flowers per package:

18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages

Next, we multiply the number of packages by the cost per package:

6 packages \* $2.50 per package = $15.00

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2
To find the total cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2, we first need to determine how many packages of 2 flowers are needed. This can be calculated by dividing the number of flowers needed by the number of flowers per package:

18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

Next, we multiply the number of packages by the cost per package:

9 packages \* $1.00 per package = $9.00

### Step 3: Compare the costs and calculate the savings

93," **Step 1: Understand the initial speed difference between Lee and Gerald**
Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.

**Step 2: Calculate Lee's running time with Gerald's initial speed**
If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, then Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

**Step 3: Determine Gerald's speed improvement**
Gerald's speed improved by 10%.

**Step 4: Calculate Gerald's new running time**
Gerald's new running time can be calculated by finding 10% of the initial time difference and subtracting it from the initial time difference:

- Time difference: 40 - 38 = 2 seconds
- 10% of 2 seconds: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 seconds
- New time difference: 2 - 0.2 = 1.8 seconds

**Step 5: Calculate Gerald's new running time with the improved speed**
Gerald's new running time is calculated by subtracting the new time difference from Lee's running time:

- New running time: 38 - 1.8 = 36.2 seconds

The answer is: Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36.2 seconds.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints9MathFormat'}

To find the number of girls, multiply the total number of students by the ratio of girls:
Number of girls = Total students * Ratio of girls

**Step 4: Find the number of girls not in the girl scout**
Finally, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in girl scout

Finally, calculate how many miles Rosie can run during the remaining 4 hours at her slower speed of 5 miles per hour:

- Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour
- She runs for 4 more hours
- So, she will run 5 miles/hour \* 4 hours = 20 miles

### 5
Add the distances Rosie ran during both the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours to find the total distance she runs in 7 hours:

- She ran 30 miles during the first 3 hours
- She will run an additional 20 miles during the remaining 4 hours

Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, then a watermelon costs 15 * 3 = $**45**.

Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, so the total cost for watermelons is 4 * 45 = $**180**.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of each orange**
An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost, so an orange costs 45 - 5 = $**40**.

Let's denote the total number of fries as `x`. After Dave ate 14 fries, there were `x - 14` fries left.

### Step 2
The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which is equivalent to 14/2 = 7 fries. So after the seagull, there were `x - 14 - 7 = x - 21` fries left.

### Step 3
Three pigeons each ate three fries, so a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons. This means there were `x - 21 - 9 = x - 30` fries left after the pigeons.

### Step 4
A raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries. In mathematical terms, the raccoon ate (2/3) * (x - 30) fries. After the raccoon, there were `x - 30 - (2/3)*(x - 30)` fries left.

### Step 5
We simplify the expression `x - 30 - (2/3)*(x - 30)` by distributing the -2/3 term, which gives us `x - 30 - (2/3)x + 20 = x/3 - 10` fries left after the raccoon.

### Step 6
Finally, ants carried off one more fry, leaving `x/3 - 10 - 1 = x/3 - 11` fries behind.

### Step 7
However, the problem states that there were 5 fries left at the end, so we set up the equation `x/3 - 11 = 5`.

- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- So the total length of the rolls in feet is 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.

**Step 3: Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants**
- There are 120 chocolate croissants, each is 6 inches long.
- So the total length of the chocolate croissants is 120 * 6 = 720 inches or 60 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

**Step 4: Calculate the total length of the baguettes**
- There are 60 baguettes, each is 2 feet long.

2. Three of these outcomes are greater than 3 (4, 5, 6).
3. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 in a single roll is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.
4. There are 6 possible outcomes for the first roll and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.
5. If an even number is rolled on the first roll, there are still 6 possible outcomes for the second roll, but only 2 even numbers (2, 4), so the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is 2/6 = 1/3 or approximately 0.33 or 33%.
6. The probability of both rolling an even number on the first roll and rolling an even number on the second roll is the product of the individual probabilities: 0.5 * 1/3 ≈ 0.17 or approximately 17%.

188," To solve this problem, let's break it down into several steps:

1. **Profit calculation**: The trader made a total profit of $400. This means that the amount of money he got from selling all the bags ($30 per bag) is $400 more than what he paid for them ($20 per bag).

2. **Transportation cost**: For each bag, the trader had to pay an additional $2 for transportation from the farm to the warehouse. So, the actual cost to the trader for each bag is $20 (purchase price) + $2 (transportation cost) = $22.

3. **Relating profit to the selling price**: If we denote the number of bags sold as `n`, then the total profit can be calculated as follows: Profit = Selling price per bag * n - Actual cost per bag * n = ($30 - $22) * n = $8 * n.

4. **Solving for `n`**: We know that the total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8 * n = $400. Solving for `n`, we find that `n = $400 / $8 = 50`.

The problem states that they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost for food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the rides**
Each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 different rides. So, the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the day**
To find the total cost for the day, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $6.75 * 3 + $15.75 + $66 = $93.50.

**Step 5: Calculate how much each friend paid**

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the number of trees he adds to his forest each year is:

    Net trees added per year = Trees planted - Trees chopped down
    Net trees added per year = 10 - 2
    Net trees added per year = 8

### Step 2: Calculate the number of trees after 10 years
After 10 years, Tom has added 8 \* 10 = 80 trees to his forest. Since he started with 50 trees, the number of trees he has after 10 years is:

Sum of scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

**Step 2: Calculate the number of points needed to reach a 93 average**

Next, calculate how many points above the current average are needed to reach a 93 average.

Points needed: 93 (desired average) - 87.6 (current average) = 5.4 points

**Step 3: Determine the weight of one test score in the average**

Since there are six tests and the lowest score is dropped, the weight of one test score in the average is:

Test weight: (Semester total points - Lowest score) / (Number of tests - 1)

Semester total points: We don't know the exact value, but we can assume it's high enough that dropping the lowest score doesn't affect the weight of a single test.

Lowest score: The minimum score possible is 0, so the weight is:

Test weight: (6 * Semester total points - 0) / (6 - 1)

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of points needed for the sixth test**

Now, we can calculate the amount of points needed for the sixth test to contribute 5.4 points to the average.

Points for the sixth test: Test weight * Points needed

Points for the sixth test: (6 * Semester total points - 0) / (6 - 1) * 5.4

**Step 5: Solve for the Semester total points**

To find the Semester total points, we can rearrange the equation from Step 4:

Semester total points = (Points for the sixth test * (6 - 1)) / (6 * Test weight)

<step-number>. We also need to find the total weight of chocolate bars in Joe's bag. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs 40g, so the total weight of chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g.

<step-number>. Finally, to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to add the total weight of candied apples and chocolate bars together. So, the total weight is 1600g + 1000g = 2600g.

<step-number>. To double-check our work, we can also find the weight of all the candy by multiplying the total number of candy pieces (25 chocolate bars + 80 candied apples = 105 pieces) by the average weight of a piece of candy. The average weight is (20g * 80 candied apples + 40g * 25 chocolate bars) / 105 pieces = 20g * 4/5 + 40g * 1/2 = 16g + 20g = 36g. Multiplying this by the total number of pieces gives us 36g * 105 pieces = 3780g / 1000g/kg = 3.78kg, which is consistent with our previous calculation.

### 2. From the problem, we know that W = R + 2 (there are two more white chickens than red chickens).

### 3. We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs produced by red and white chickens daily is 3R (from red chickens) + 5(R+2) (from white chickens).

### 4. The problem states that every day Jerry collects 42 eggs, which is the total number of eggs produced by the chickens daily. So, we can set up the equation: 3R + 5(R+2) = 42.

### 5. Solving this equation, we first distribute the 5, which gives us: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

### 6. Then, we combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42.

### 7. We subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32.

### 8. Finally, we divide both sides by 8 to solve for R: R = 32 / 8 = 4.

### 9. However, we must remember that W = R + 2, so if R = 4, then W = 4 + 2 = 6. But the problem states that every day Jerry collects 42 eggs, and with 4 red chickens and 6 white chickens, the total number of eggs collected daily would be 3*4 + 5*6 = 12 + 30 = 42, which doesn't leave any eggs for Jerry's consumption or sale. This contradicts the information given in the problem.

**Step 2** : Calculate the total distance Gary walks. Since the park is a rectangle, and Gary walks around the edge, he walks a total of 1.5 miles (short side) + 6 miles (long side) = 7.5 miles.

**Step 3** : Gary's walking speed is 3 miles/hour. 

**Step 4** : To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed. 

**Step 5** : So, 7.5 miles ÷ 3 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.

**Step 6** : However, this is the time in terms of hours and fractions of an hour. Since Gary can't walk for a fraction of an hour, we need to convert the 0.5 hours into minutes.

**Step 7** : There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.5 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

- Jerry has two pools, one is big and the other is small.
- Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

**Step 2: Determine the rate of water change between the pools**
- The big pool initially had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- This means that for every 2 gallons drained from the big pool, only 1 gallon is drained from the small pool (since they leak at the same rate).
- Therefore, the big pool loses water twice as fast as the small pool gains water.

**Step 3: Calculate the new water ratio between the pools**
- After 4 minutes, the big pool has lost an amount of water equal to its initial volume (since it now has no water).
- During this time, the small pool has gained an amount of water equal to 1/2 of the big pool's initial volume.
- Since the big pool's initial volume was twice that of the small pool, the small pool has gained 1/4 of its current volume in these 4 minutes.

**Step 4: Find the current volume of the small pool**
- Let x be the initial volume of the small pool.

John has twice as many candies as Robert, and we know that John has 54 candies. So, we can calculate the number of candies Robert has:

- Robert's candies = 54 / 2
- Robert's candies = 27

- James' candies = 27 + 6
- James' candies = 33

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in candies between John and James
Now that we know how many candies James and John have, we can find the difference:

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and we know that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. To find the total weight of the tree, we first need to determine how many 10-foot sections are in 200 feet.

### Step 2: Determine the number of 10-foot sections in 200 feet
There are 20 sections of 10 feet in 200 feet (200 ÷ 10 = 20).

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight before termite damage
Now, we can calculate the total weight of the tree before termite damage by multiplying the number of 10-foot sections by the weight of each section: 20 sections × 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

### Step 4: Calculate the weight lost due to termite damage
Termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find the weight of the wood that was eaten, we need to calculate 30% of 8000 pounds: (30/100) × 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

### Step 5: Calculate the current weight of the redwood tree

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. The solo song has 54 lines, so the first scene has 2 \* 54 = 108 lines.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of Sean's lines in the first scene
Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines in the first scene.

First, let's find out how many cards have the letter A on them. We know that Carly had 80 cards, and 2/5 of them had the letter A. So, we need to calculate:

80 * 2/5 = 32

The answer is: 32 cards had the letter A on them.

### Step 2
Next, we need to find out how many cards have the letter B on them. To do this, we first need to determine how many cards are left after removing the ones with the letter A. So, we subtract the number of cards with the letter A from the total number of cards:

80 - 32 = 48

Now, we know that 1/2 of these remaining cards have the letter B. So, we calculate:

48 * 1/2 = 24

The answer is: 24 cards had the letter B on them.

### Step 3
Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the ones with the letters A and B. So, we subtract the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards:

48 - 24 = 24

The answer is: 24 cards are left after removing the ones with the letters A and B.

### Step 4
Next, we need to find out how many cards have the letter C on them. We know that 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter C. So, we calculate:

24 * 5/8 = 15

The answer is: 15 cards had the letter C on them.

### Step 5
Now, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the ones with the letters A, B, and C. So, we subtract the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards:

24 - 15 = 9

The answer is: 9 cards are left after removing the ones with the letters A, B, and C.

### Step 6
Finally, we can determine how many cards have the letter D on them. Since these are the only cards left, all of them must have the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is equal to the number of remaining cards:

The problem states that Mico and Marco's current age sum is 20. We need to find the sum of their ages after 10 years.

### Step 2: Acknowledge the given information
Mico and Marco's current age sum is 20.

### Step 3: Make assumptions
Let's assume Mico's age is `m` and Marco's age is `M`. We know that `m + M = 20`.

1. **Define the variables**
Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

2. **Set up the first equation**
We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write this as: R = 6S

3. **Set up the second equation**
In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So in 9 years, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age. We can write this as: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

4. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation**
We can substitute the first equation (R = 6S) into the second equation (R + 9 = 3(S + 9)) to get: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

5. **Solve for S**
To solve for S, we first distribute the 3 on the right side of the equation: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
Then, subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27
Subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18
Finally, divide both sides by 3: S = 6

So, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.

### Step 2: Determine how many times the 3 other people bid
Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins, the 3 other people each bid once.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money spent by the 3 other people
As we know, each bid increases by $50. So, the total amount of money spent by the 3 other people is 3 * $50 = $150.

### Step 4: Carmen accepts the opening bid
Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.

### Step 5: Carmen continues bidding after each of the 3 other people
She bids after each of the 3 other people, so that's 3 additional bids from Carmen.

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount of money spent by Carmen due to her additional bids
Since each bid increases by $50, the total amount of money spent by Carmen due to her additional bids is 3 * $50 = $150.

### Step 7: Add the opening bid and Carmen's additional bids
To find the total amount of money Carmen spends on the desk, add the opening bid and Carmen's additional bids: $200 + $150.

Since a business suit costs $100, the total cost for 6 suits would be 6 * $100 = $<<6*100=600>>600.
And since a suitcase costs $50, the total cost for 3 suitcases would be 3 * $50 = $<<3*50=150>>150.

<step-number>. Next, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket.

The problem states that the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. So, the flight ticket costs 5 * $100 + $700 = $<<5*100+700=1200>>1200.

To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we first need to determine how many new records they received in total.

John spent half as much time swimming as he did boating. Since he spent 6 hours boating, he spent 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

### Step 2: Calculate the time John spent watching shows
Each show was 2 hours long, and John watched 3 shows. So he spent 2 hours/show \* 3 shows = 6 hours watching shows.

### Step 3: Determine what fraction of John's time was spent watching shows
John spent 30% of his time watching shows. This means that the time he spent watching shows is 30% of his total vacation time.

### Step 4: Calculate the total time John spent on activities we know about
The activities we know about are boating, swimming, and watching shows. John spent 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming, and 6 hours watching shows, for a total of 6 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours.

### Step 5: Determine what fraction of John's total vacation time remains unknown
We know that John spent 30% of his time watching shows, and we have accounted for 15 hours of his time. This means that 70% of his time remains unknown.

### Step 6: Calculate the time John spent sightseeing
John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Since we know that 70% of his time remains unknown, we can calculate the number of hours he spent sightseeing as follows: (40% of total time) = (40% \* total time) / 100% = (unknown time) / 100% \* 40% = unknown time \* 0.4.

### Step 7: Solve for the unknown time
We know that John spent 15 hours on the activities we have accounted for, and that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can set up the following equation: 15 hours + unknown time \* 0.4 = total time.

### Step 8: Calculate the total time John spent on vacation
We know that John spent 15 hours on the activities we have accounted for, and that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. We can set up the following equation: 15 hours + unknown time \* 0.4 = total time. To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, since 40% of the total time is unknown time \* 0.4. This gives us total time = 15 hours / 0.6 = 25 hours.

### Step 9: Calculate the time John spent sightseeing
Now that we know the total time John spent on vacation, we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing. We know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we can calculate this as follows: unknown time \* 0.4 = 25 hours \* 0.4 = 10 hours.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks as `mask_refusal`. The problem states that this number is 3.

### Step 2
We are told that four times the number of mask refusers, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we can calculate the number of shoplifters (`shoplifting`) as follows:

`shoplifting = 4 * mask_refusal - 5`
`shoplifting = 4 * 3 - 5`
`shoplifting = 12 - 5`
`shoplifting = 7`

### Step 3
The problem further states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, we can calculate the number of customers kicked out for violence (`violence`) as follows:

`violence = 3 * shoplifting`
`violence = 3 * 7`
`violence = 21`

### Step 4
Now, we know that the total number of customers kicked out is 50. We have accounted for the customers kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and violence. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons (`other_reasons`) is:

`other_reasons = total_kicked_out - (mask_refusal + shoplifting + violence)`
`other_reasons = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)`
`other_reasons = 50 - 31`
`other_reasons = 19`

- The cost of each picture frame is $20.
- So, for 44 seniors, the cost would be: `44 * $20 = $880`

### <step_2>
Next, let's calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each picture frame.

- The etching cost is an additional 20% per frame.
- So, the cost for etching all 44 frames would be: `0.20 * $20 * 44 = $176`

### <step_3>
Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins for the 2 seniors who are receiving them.

- The cost of each pin is $5.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the 1/4 of the seniors who are officers.

- There are 44 seniors, so there are `44 / 4 = 11` officers.

- So, the cost for the cords would be: `11 * $12 = $132`

### <step_5>

- The cost for the picture frames is $880.
- The cost for the etching is $176.
- The cost for the pins is $10.
- The cost for the cords is $132.

373," ### Step 1: Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment
The company bought equipment worth $400,000 and 40% of these were faulty. To find out how much the faulty pieces cost, we first need to determine their number.

`Faulty pieces = Total pieces * Percentage of faulty pieces`

`Faulty pieces = $400,000 * 40/100`

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of faulty pieces of equipment
Now that we have the number of faulty pieces, we can calculate their total cost.

`Cost of faulty pieces = Faulty pieces * Cost per piece`

However, since we don't know the cost per piece, let's proceed with the calculation using variables and then substitute the values when they become available.

Let 'c' be the cost per piece.

`Cost of faulty pieces = ($400,000 * 40/100) * c`

### Step 3: Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment
The total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces gives us the number of functioning pieces.

`Functioning pieces = Total pieces - Faulty pieces`

`Functioning pieces = $400,000/c - ($400,000 * 40/100)`

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of functioning pieces of equipment
Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

`Cost of functioning pieces = Functioning pieces * Cost per piece`

Substituting the value for 'Functioning pieces' from Step 3, we get:

`Cost of functioning pieces = ($400,000/c - ($400,000 * 40/100)) * c`

### Step 5: Simplify the equation
Simplifying the equation from Step 4 gives us:

`Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - ($400,000 * 40/100)`

### Step 6: Calculate the cost of functioning pieces
Now we can substitute the percentage value into the equation to find the cost of the functioning pieces.

`Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - ($400,000 * 40/100)`

`Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - $160,000`

389," **Step 1: Calculate the cost of David buying a ride bracelet**
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Therefore, each ride with the bracelet costs $30/9 = $3.33 (approximately).

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of Dasha buying tickets**
- Each ticket costs $2 and gives 1 ride.
- Since they ride all 9 rides, Dasha needs to buy 9 tickets for $2*9 = $18.

**Step 3: Compare the costs to find the savings**
- The total cost for David with the ride bracelet is $30.
- The total cost for Dasha with tickets is $18.
- Together, they pay $30 (David) + $18 (Dasha) = $48 for all 9 rides.

**Step 4: Calculate the cost if they both bought tickets**
- If David also bought tickets instead of a bracelet, he would need 9 tickets for $2*9 = $18.
- Together, they would pay $18 (David) + $18 (Dasha) = $36 for all 9 rides.

**Step 5: Find the savings**
- By comparing the costs in Step 3 and Step 4, we can see that they pay $48 in total when David buys a bracelet and Dasha buys tickets.
- If they both bought tickets, they would pay $36 in total.
- Therefore, David saves $48 - $36 = $12 when buying a ride bracelet compared to buying tickets.

To make calculations easier, let's convert all the time values to minutes. We know that:
- Writing the song took 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
- Recording took half as long as writing, so that was 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.
- Editing took 90 minutes.

### Step 2: Add up all time values
The total work time is the sum of writing, recording, and editing times. So, 240 (writing) + 120 (recording) + 90 (editing) equals 450 minutes.

### Step 3: Calculate the editing time percentage
To find out what percentage of the total work time was spent editing, divide the editing time by the total work time and multiply by 100. Therefore, (90/450)*100 = 20%.

### Step 4: Repeat the calculation to confirm
Just to be sure, let's check if our result makes sense by calculating the percentage of time spent on writing and recording as well. For writing, it would be (240/450)*100 = 53.33%, and for recording, (120/450)*100 = 26.67%. Adding these up, we get 53.33% + 26.67% + 20% = 100%.

Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and each hour uses 900 watts of energy. So, the total daily energy usage is:
- Initial daily usage = Hours per day * Wattage
- Initial daily usage = 8 hours * 900 watts

### Step 2: Convert the wattage to kilowatts
Since the final result should be in kilowatts, we need to convert the wattage:
- 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 watts
- Daily usage in kW = (8 hours * 900 watts) / 1000

### Step 3: Calculate the new daily energy usage after reducing the usage time
Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, using it now for 3 hours a day. We calculate the new daily energy usage:
- New daily usage = Hours per day * Wattage
- New daily usage = 3 hours * 900 watts

   - Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.

2. Next, let's find out how many stripes the third zebra has.
   - Jane says the third zebra has half as many stripes as the first two, which means it has 17 / 2 = 8.5 stripes. However, zebras can't have half a stripe, so there might be a mistake in Jane's count. Assuming all zebras have an even number of stripes, we can round up to 9 stripes.

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

### Step 2: Set up the equations based on the problem description
From the problem, we know two facts:
- There are 180 heads in total. Since both camels and dromedaries have one head each, C + D = 180.
- There are 304 humps in total. Camels have two humps each, so they contribute 2C to the total number of humps. Dromedaries have one hump each, so they contribute D to the total number of humps. Therefore, 2C + D = 304.

### Step 3: Solve the first equation for one variable
Let's solve the first equation for C: C = 180 - D.

### Step 4: Substitute the expression for C into the second equation
Now substitute this expression into the second equation: 2(180 - D) + D = 304.

### Step 5: Simplify and solve for D
Simplify and solve for D: 360 - 2D + D = 304, which gives us D = 56.

### Step 6: Substitute D back into the equation for C
Substitute D = 56 into the equation C = 180 - D to find C: C = 180 - 56 = 124.

### Step 7: Verify the solution

George spent $5, and each item (chip or candy bar) costs either 40 cents (chips) or 75 cents (candy bars). Let's assume George bought `c` candy bars and `x` bags of chips.

So, the total cost of the chips is 40 cents \* `x` and the total cost of the candy bars is 75 cents \* `c`.

The total number of items George bought is `x + c`.

### Step 2: Write an equation for the total cost
The total cost of the items George bought is the total cost of the chips and the total cost of the candy bars, which equals $5.

So, we can write the equation: 40x + 75c = 500 (since $1 is 100 cents)

### Step 3: Write an equation for the total number of items
We know that George spent all but 1% of his money, so the total cost of the items he bought is equal to 99% of $5.

So, we can write the equation: 40x + 75c = 0.99 \* 500 (since $5 is 500 cents)

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Now we have the following equation:

40x + 75c = 495

### Step 5: Use trial and error to find the values of x and c
We can use trial and error to find integer values of `x` and `c` that satisfy the equation.

By trying different values of `x`, we find that when `x = 7`, the left side of the equation is equal to 495.

So, George bought 7 bags of chips.

### Step 6: Calculate the number of candy bars George bought
Since George bought 7 bags of chips, and we know that he bought a total of 7 + `c` items, we can calculate the number of candy bars he bought:

c = 7 + c
c = 7

So, George bought 7 candy bars.

- The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.
- To find the cost per sneaker, divide the total cost by the number of sneakers: $576 / 48 = $12 per sneaker.

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from the flash sale**
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale for $20 each.
- To find the revenue, multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price: 17 * $20 = $340.

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from the department store**
- The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to the department store for $25 each.

- We know that by not buying the super ticket, the person still managed to save $2.
- This $2 savings comes from the difference in price between the super ticket and regular ticket, and the cost of the popcorn and soda.
- Since the super ticket is $20 and the regular ticket is $12, the difference in price is $20 - $12 = $8.
- Therefore, the popcorn and soda must cost $8 - $3 (the cost of the soda) = $5.
- However, we're only interested in the cost of the popcorn, which is $5 - $3 (the cost of the soda) = $2.

**Step 2: Confirm the answer**

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. To find the original cost per balloon, we divide the total cost by the number of balloons:

Original cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20
Original cost per balloon = $45

### Step 2: Determine the price increase
The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20 after two days.

### Step 3: Calculate the new cost per balloon
To find the new cost per balloon, we add the original cost per balloon to the price increase:

New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Price increase
New cost per balloon = $45 + $20
New cost per balloon = $65

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price
To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons Bentley filled:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = $65 * 170

First, we need to determine the cost of the pizza that Ashley ordered. From the question, we know that the delivery cost is $15.

Since the tip should be equal to 1/5 of the amount Ashley ordered, and the delivery cost is $15, it means that the actual cost of the pizza is four times the delivery cost (because 1 - 1/5 = 4/5, so the pizza cost is 4 times the delivery cost).

**Step 2: Convert the shark's length to inches**
- The shark is 10 feet long.

So, one-fourth of ""s"" equals 20 students (the number of students without a desktop computer).

**Step 3**
Set up the equation: One-fourth of ""s"" equals 20 students, so the equation is:

s/4 = 20

**Step 4**
Solve for ""s"": To solve for ""s"", first multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

s = 20 * 4

**Step 5**
Calculate the value:

s = 80

**Step 6**
Verify the units: The problem does not specify any units for the number of students, so no units are needed for the answer.

**Step 7**
Check the reasonableness of the answer: Given the information, the answer seems reasonable. Three-fourths of 80 students would have a desktop computer, which leaves one-fourth (or 20 students) without a desktop computer.

**Step 8**
State the final answer: The answer is:

There are 80 students in that grade level.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints9MathFormat'}

1. **Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125.**

2. **There are 15 days in each half of the month (April has 30 days).**

3. **Let's denote the amount saved each day in the first half as x.**

4. **So, the total savings for the first half would be 15x.**

Now, let's move on to the second half of the month.

5. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half compared to the first half.**

6. **So, the amount saved each day in the second half would be 2x.**

7. **The total savings for the second half should also be equal to the total savings for the first half.**

8. **Therefore, the total savings for the second half would also be 15 * 2x = 30x.**

Since the total savings for the month should be $1125, we can now set up the following equation:

9. **The total savings for the first half plus the total savings for the second half should equal the monthly target.**

10. **So, 15x + 30x = $1125.**

Solving for x, we get:

- x = $1125 / 45
- x ≈ $25

So, Elvis needs to save approximately $25 each day in the first half of the month.

Now, let's find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half:

- Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he needs to save 2 * $25 = $50 each day in the second half.

- Verna bought five oranges at $0.80 each.
- The total cost of oranges is 5 (oranges) * $0.80 (price per orange) = $4.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of peaches**

### Step 2: Calculate the number of red jelly beans
Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans:

Red jelly beans = Blue jelly beans * (1 - 1%)

Red jelly beans = Blue jelly beans * 0.99

### Step 3: Calculate the number of green jelly beans
Similarly, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = Blue jelly beans * (1 + 1%)

Green jelly beans = Blue jelly beans * 1.01

### Step 4: Determine the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans
Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans:

Difference = Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans

Difference = (Blue jelly beans * 1.01) - (Blue jelly beans * 0.99)

### Step 5: Simplify the difference
Simplify the expression to find the difference:

Difference = Blue jelly beans * (1.01 - 0.99)

Difference = Blue jelly beans * 0.02

### Step 6: Substitute the number of blue jelly beans
Substitute the number of blue jelly beans from Step 1:

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. This is the distance we need to consider.

### Step 2: Determine the relative speed
Relative speed is the difference between the speeds of two objects moving in opposite directions or the sum of their speeds if they are moving in the same direction. In this case, since both Bob and Tom are moving in the same direction (towards each other), their relative speed is the sum of their speeds.

- Bob's speed: 55 mph
- Tom's speed: 70 mph
- Relative speed: 55 + 70 = 125 mph

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob
To find out how long it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Using the values from our previous steps:

Time = 75 miles / 125 mph = 0.6 hours

### Step 4: Convert the time to hours and minutes
We found that it takes 0.6 hours for Tom to catch up with Bob. We should convert this into hours and minutes:

- Hours: 0.6 * 60 = 36 minutes, which is approximately 0.6 hours

So, it takes about 0.6 hours (or 36 minutes) for Tom to catch up with Bob.

We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran:

Reggie's distance = 5 \* Paisley's distance
Reggie's distance = 5 \* 4
Reggie's distance = 20 miles

### Step 2: Figure out how much farther Reggie ran than Lynn

We know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if we subtract Lynn's distance from Reggie's distance, we get:

3 miles = Reggie's distance - Lynn's distance

### Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for Lynn's distance

We can rearrange the equation from Step 2 to solve for Lynn's distance:

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles

First, we need to determine how much one apple and one orange costs. We can do this by dividing the total cost by the number of items.

- The total cost of oranges is $3.30 for 3 oranges. So, one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the desired quantities
Now that we know the price per apple and per orange, we can calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

- The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
- The cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

### Step 3: Add the costs together
Finally, we add the costs of the apples and oranges together to find the total cost.

James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on hanger rental. His hanger rental cost is $5000, so his monthly fuel cost is 2 \* $5000 = $**10,000**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total monthly cost of the plane
This includes the hanger rental and the fuel cost. So, it's $5000 + $10000 = $**15,000** per month.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the first year

There are 3 people in the set of triplets and 2 people in the set of twins. So, in total, there are 5 people.

### 2. Consider the age difference

One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This means that the other twin is also 7 years older than the other two triplets.

### 3. Set up the equation

Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the older triplet is x+7 and each twin is x+7 and x+14 (one is 7 years older than a triplet, the other is 14 years older).

### 4. Use the given information

The combined age of all of them is 44. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x+7 + x+14 + x+7 + x+14 = 44

### 5. Simplify the equation

5x + 32 = 44

### 6. Solve for x

Subtract 32 from both sides: 5x = 12

**Step 2** : However, we can find the cost of 5 lollipops, which is $0.40 each. So, 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

**Step 3** : Now, we know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20, and the cost of 5 lollipops is $2.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 candies is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

**Step 4** : But, the question asks for the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. We only have the cost for 5 lollipops and 4 candies. So, we need to multiply these costs by 2.

**Step 5** : Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is 2 * $0.40/lollipop = $0.80/lollipop * 10 lollipops = $8.00.

John is making a 6 egg omelet, and each egg is 75 calories. So the total calories from the eggs are:
- Egg calories = Number of eggs * Calories per egg
- Egg calories = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg
- Egg calories = 450 calories

### Step 2: Calculate the calories from cheese
There are 2 oz of cheese in the omelet, and cheese has 120 calories per ounce. So the total calories from the cheese are:
- Cheese calories = Weight of cheese * Calories per ounce
- Cheese calories = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz
- Cheese calories = 240 calories

### Step 3: Calculate the calories from ham
John is adding an equal amount of ham to the omelet as cheese, so there are also 2 oz of ham. With 40 calories per ounce, the total calories from the ham are:
- Ham calories = Weight of ham * Calories per ounce
- Ham calories = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz
- Ham calories = 80 calories

### Step 4: Calculate the total calories from the omelet
Now we can find the total calories from the omelet by adding the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham:
- Omelet calories = Egg calories + Cheese calories + Ham calories
- Omelet calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories
- Omelet calories = 770 calories

* First, let's calculate how many taps Helga can do with each foot when her arms are at her sides. She can tap her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute.
* Since she can do these taps simultaneously, we add these two rates together to get the combined tap rate: 300 (right foot) + 250 (left foot) = 550 taps per minute.
* However, Helga only dances with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes, because for 2 minutes, her arms are raised.
* So, for the 3 minutes that her arms are at her sides, she can tap her feet a total of 550 taps per minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.
* Now, let's calculate how many taps Helga can do with each foot when her arms are raised. She can tap each foot 200 times per minute.
* Since she can do these taps simultaneously, we add these two rates together to get the combined tap rate: 200 (right foot) + 200 (left foot) = 400 taps per minute.
* Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes, so for those 2 minutes, she can tap her feet a total of 400 taps per minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.
* To find the total number of taps for the 5 minutes, we add the number of taps she did with her arms at her sides and the number of taps she did with her arms raised: 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet 4 inches. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, so convert the feet part first:
8 feet × 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Now add the 4 inches to get the total length in inches:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

### Step 2: Use the information about the relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths to create an equation
The problem states that one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x (in inches). Then the length of one of Topher's shoes is (9x + 10) inches.

### Step 3: Set up the equation using the given length of Topher's shoe
We now know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. So we can set up the following equation:
9x + 10 = 100

### Step 4: Solve for x (Bobby's shoe length)
To solve for x, first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9x = 90
Now divide both sides by 9:
x = 10

### Step 5: Check the solution
Let's check if our solution makes sense by calculating the length of one of Topher's shoes using the solved value of x:
Topher's shoe length = 9 * Bobby's shoe length + 10
= 9 * 10 + 10
= 90 + 10
= 100 inches

Since this matches the given length of one of Topher's shoes, our solution is correct.

First, let's find out how many windows Hannah smashed on the students' cars. Each student's car has four windows, and she damaged a quarter of them.

### Step 2
There are 64 students' cars, so there are a total of 64 * 4 = 256 windows on the students' cars.

### Step 3
Hannah damaged a quarter of these, so she smashed 256 / 4 = 64 windows on the students' cars.

### Step 4
Next, let's find out how many windows she smashed on the teachers' cars. Each teacher's car has two windows, and she damaged three-quarters of them.

### Step 5
There are 32 teachers' cars, so there are a total of 32 * 2 = 64 windows on the teachers' cars.

### Step 6
Hannah damaged three-quarters of these, so she smashed 64 * 3 / 4 = 48 windows on the teachers' cars.

### Step 7
To find the total number of windows Hannah smashed, we add the windows she smashed on the students' cars and the teachers' cars together.

There are 54 students and they will be divided into 6 groups. To find the number of students per group, we can use the formula:

Number of students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups

Number of students per group = 54 / 6 = 9 students

### Step 2: Calculate the number of groups for the activity
The activity requires 12 groups. To find the number of students per group for the activity, we can use the formula:

Number of students per group (for the activity) = Total number of groups (for the activity) / Number of groups

Number of students per group (for the activity) = 12 / 6 = 2 groups

### Step 3: Calculate the number of additional groups needed
Since there are 54 students and the activity requires 12 groups, we can calculate the number of additional groups needed by subtracting the number of groups for the activity from the number of groups for the students:

Additional groups needed = Number of groups for the students - Number of groups for the activity

Additional groups needed = 6 - 12 = -6

=================================================================

Anthony gave `1/2` of his pencils to Brandon, so he gave:

`Pencils given to Brandon = Total pencils * Pencils fraction`

`Pencils given to Brandon = 50 * 1/2`

<step-number>. Next, calculate the number of pencils left after giving to Brandon.
=============================================================================

Subtract the pencils given to Brandon from the total pencils:

`Pencils left = Total pencils - Pencils given to Brandon`

`Pencils left = 50 - (50 * 1/2)`

<step-number>. Then, calculate how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie.
======================================================================

Anthony gave `3/5` of the remaining pencils to Charlie, so he gave:

`Pencils given to Charlie = Pencils left * Charlie's pencils fraction`

`Pencils given to Charlie = (50 - (50 * 1/2)) * 3/5`

<step-number>. Now, calculate the number of pencils left after giving to Charlie.
=============================================================================

Subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the pencils left:

`Pencils kept = Pencils left - Pencils given to Charlie`

`Pencils kept = (50 - (50 * 1/2)) - ((50 - (50 * 1/2)) * 3/5)`

<step-number>. Finally, simplify the expression to find out how many pencils Anthony kept.
=====================================================================================

`Anthony kept = (50 - (50 * 1/2)) - ((50 - (50 * 1/2)) * 3/5)`

`Anthony kept = (50 - 25) - ((25) * 3/5)`

First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has.

- Three stuffed puppies
- Five stuffed koalas
- Two stuffed zebras
- Four stuffed frogs

Adding these together, Bubbles has a total of `3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14` stuffed animals.

### 2
Next, we need to determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should have in order for them to make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.

- Let G represent the number of stuffed goats.

We're looking for a value of G such that the percentage of G out of the total number of stuffed animals is 30%.

### 3
To find this value of G, we can set up the following equation:

`G / (G + 14) = 30%`

### 4
Solving for G, we first convert 30% to a decimal:

`G / (G + 14) = 0.3`

### 5
Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by (G + 14) to isolate G:

`G = 0.3 * (G + 14)`

### 6
Distribute the 0.3 on the right side of the equation:

`G = 0.3G + 4.2`

### 7
Subtract 0.3G from both sides to solve for G:

`0.7G = 4.2`

### 8
Finally, divide both sides by 0.7 to find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy:

`G = 4.2 / 0.7`

`G = 6`

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

In a year, there are 12 months. However, we are interested in the number of doubling periods that occur until May, which is the 5th month. So, there are 4 doubling periods from January to May.

**Step 3** : Calculate the growth factor
Since the number of students doubles at the end of each month, the growth factor is 2.

- We have 3 people: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ
- The total number of Magic Cards is 341
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick
- Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has

### Step 2: Set up the equations

Let B represent the number of cards Becca has, S for Smendrick, and P for PJ.

- B = S + 12
- S = 3P
- B + S + P = 341

### Step 3: Solve for one variable

Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

- (S + 12) + S + (S/3) = 341

Replace S with 3P from the second equation:

- (3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341

### Step 4: Solve for another variable

Combine like terms:

- 8P + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

- 8P = 329

Divide both sides by 8:

- P = 41.125

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, PJ must have 41 cards.

### Step 5: Solve for the last variable

Substitute P = 41 into the second equation:

- S = 3 * 41
- S = 123

Substitute S = 123 into the first equation:

- B = 123 + 12

3. **Next, we need to determine the speed of one turtle.** It's given that each turtle moves at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is `6 hours / 2 = 3 hours` to cross the same distance a kangaroo does in one hour.

4. **Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway.** Since the distance remains the same and the speed of a turtle is given as 3 hours, the time taken by one turtle is `highway distance / speed of turtle = highway distance / 3 hours`.

The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day. So the total milk production is 3 cows * 5 liters = 15 liters a day.

**Step 2: Determine the additional milk production needed**
The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Currently, he's at 15 liters. So he needs an additional 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters a day.

**Step 3: Calculate the milk production per cow needed to reach the goal**
The farmer currently has 3 cows producing 15 liters a day. To get 10 more liters, he needs to figure out how much more each cow needs to produce. So he divides the additional milk needed by the number of cows: 10 liters / 3 cows = approximately 3.33 liters more per cow.

**Step 4: Determine the number of cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters**
To find out how many more cows he needs, the farmer needs to divide the additional milk needed by the milk production per cow: 10 liters / 3.33 liters/cow = approximately 3 cows.

**Step 5: Summarize the total number of cows needed**
Since the farmer currently has 3 cows producing 15 liters a day, and he needs 3 more cows to produce an additional 10 liters a day, he needs a total of 3 (current cows) + 3 (additional cows) = 6 cows.

Each student sold 10 lollipops on average, and there are 30 students in the class. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:

- Total lollipops sold = Students * Lollipops per student
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops
- Total lollipops sold = 300 lollipops

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the lollipops
The lollipops cost $0.5 each, so the total cost of buying the lollipops is:

- Total cost = Total lollipops sold * Cost per lollipop
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5

Larry has 3 cats.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of dogs
Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 \* 3 = 9 dogs.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of rabbits
Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

- The sloth takes 4 hours to complete one trip (down the tree, picking up berries, and climbing back up).

**Step 2: Determine the number of trips possible in 8 hours**
- In 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips.

**Step 3: Consider the constraint of picking the same number of berries on each trip**
- To minimize the number of berries picked, we need to maximize the number of trips.

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- The price of each New York Times is $5.
- So, the commission for each copy is 10% \* $5 = $0.50.
- For 6 copies, the total commission will be 6 \* $0.50 = $3.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the commission for Wall Street Journal**

2. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus's age is 26 - 5 = 21.
3. The problem states that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so we can write this relationship as Marcus = 0.5 * Leo.
4. We can substitute Marcus's age into this equation to get 21 = 0.5 * Leo.
5. To solve for Leo's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5 to get Leo = 21 / 0.5 = 42.

Currently, 1/5 of the beds are occupied. We can calculate the number of occupied beds by dividing the total capacity by 5.

Occupied beds = Total capacity / 5

= 200 beds

**Step 2 - Calculate the number of new patients over 2 weeks**
50 patients are admitted each day, so over 14 days (2 weeks), the number of new patients would be:

New patients = Patients per day * Days
= 50 * 14
= 700 patients

**Step 3 - Find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**
To find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, we add the current number of occupied beds to the number of new patients:

Total occupied beds = Current occupied beds + New patients
= 200 + 700
= 900 beds

**Step 4 - Calculate the number of unoccupied beds**
Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity:

984," ### Step 1: Calculate how many plants Pat needs to buy
First, we need to determine how many plants Pat needs to buy to fill up her flower bed. Since she already owns 17 flowers, we'll subtract that number from the total needed.

To calculate the total number of plants needed, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space required between plants (1.5 feet) and add 1 (for the plant at the beginning of the bed). Then, we divide that number by the width of one plant (1 foot, since the plants are 12 inches wide) to convert it to the number of plants.

Total plants needed = (flower bed length / space between plants) + 1
Total plants needed = (111 feet / 1.5 feet) + 1
Total plants needed = 74 + 1
Total plants needed = 75

Plants to buy = Total plants needed - Plants already owned
Plants to buy = 75 - 17
Plants to buy = 58

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the plants Pat needs to buy
Now that we know Pat needs to buy 58 plants, we can calculate the cost. Each plant costs $6, so we multiply the number of plants by the cost per plant.

Cost of plants = Number of plants to buy * Cost per plant
Cost of plants = 58 plants * $6

991," **Step 1** : Understand the problem
We are given that Comet Halley appears every 75 years and Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. We need to find out when Bill saw the Comet for the first time.

**Step 2** : Find out when Bill's father saw the Comet last
If Comet Halley appears every 75 years, then Bill's father must have seen it last when he was 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

**Step 3** : Calculate the difference in years between Bill's two viewings
Since Bill saw the Comet when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw it, Bill must have been 3*(105 - 30) = 255 years old during his second viewing.

**Step 4** : Determine how many times the Comet appeared between Bill's two viewings
The Comet appeared (255 - 105) / 75 = 2 times between Bill's two viewings.

**Step 5** : Find out when Bill first saw the Comet
Since the Comet appears every 75 years, Bill must have first seen it 75 years before his second viewing, when he was 255 - 75 = 180 years old.

**Step 6** : Realize that Bill cannot be older than his father
Our calculation shows that Bill was 180 years old during his first viewing, which contradicts the fact that Bill is younger than his father.

**Step 7** : Revise our calculation
We made an error in Step 3 by assuming Bill was three times older than his father during his second viewing. Instead, Bill was three times older than his father was during Bill's first viewing. Therefore, Bill was actually 3*30 = 90 years old during his second viewing.

**Step 8** : Recalculate the first viewing age for Bill
Bill was 90 years old during his second viewing, which occurred 75 years after his first viewing. So, Bill must have been 90 - 75 = 15 years old during his first viewing.

**Step 9** : Confirm the answer
Yes, Bill could have been 15 years old when he first saw the Comet, given that his father was 30 years old during his own first viewing.

1004," **Step 1** : Peter has 4 boxes of chocolate bars with an equal number in each. The total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. To find the number of chocolate bars in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

`Number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes`
`= 64 / 4`
`= 16`

**Step 2** : Martha has 7 boxes of chocolate bars with an equal number in each. The total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. To find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

`Number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha = Total chocolate bars / Number of boxes`

- The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- So, to find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5: 50 \* 3/5 = 30.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of new porcupines born each month**
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- Therefore, the total number of new porcupines born each month is the number of female porcupines (30) multiplied by the number of babies each female gives birth to (4): 30 \* 4 = 120.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of new porcupines born in a year**
- There are 12 months in a year.
- So, the total number of new porcupines born in a year is the number of new porcupines born each month (120) multiplied by the number of months in a year (12): 120 \* 12 = 1440.

**Step 4: Add the new porcupines born in a year to the original population**
- To find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we add the number of new porcupines born in a year (1440) to the original population (50): 50 + 1440 = 1490.

- The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
- After that, it loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
- The final charge remaining is 28%.

**Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the power bank**
- After losing 9% for 5 hours, the power bank loses 45% of its capacity (5 hours \* 9% = 45%).
- After losing 7% for 3 hours, the power bank loses an additional 21% of its capacity (3 hours \* 7% = 21%).
- In total, the power bank loses 66% of its capacity (45% + 21% = 66%).
- Since the final charge remaining is 28%, the power bank must have started with a total capacity of 100% - 28% = 72%.

**Step 3: Verify the calculation**
- If the power bank had a total capacity of 72%, then after losing 45% in 5 hours, it would have 27% of its capacity left (72% \* (1 - 0.45) = 27%).
- After losing an additional 21% in the next 3 hours, it would have 28% of its capacity left (27% - 21% \* (3 / 5) = 28%).

- Cole's height was given in inches (50 inches).
- To compare with Xavier's height, we need to convert it to feet.
- We know that 1 foot = 12 inches.

### Step 2: Calculate Cole's new height in feet
- So, Cole's height in feet is 50 inches / 12 inches/foot = 4.17 feet (approximately, as we cannot have a fraction of an inch in feet).

### Step 3: Note down the growth measurements
- Xavier's initial height was 4 feet and he grew 3 inches.
- Cole's initial height was 4.17 feet (converted from 50 inches) and he grew 2 inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the new heights
- Xavier's new height is 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet + 0.25 feet = 4.25 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 3 inches = 3/12 = 0.25 feet).
- Cole's new height is 4.17 feet + 2 inches = 4.17 feet + 0.17 feet = 4.34 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 2 inches = 2/12 = 0.17 feet).

### Step 5: Find the difference between their heights
- The difference between their heights now is Cole's height - Xavier's height = 4.34 feet - 4.25 feet = 0.09 feet.

3. The third set required half as many balls as the second set, so we can denote the number of balls in the third set as `x / 2`.

5. To solve this equation, first, we need to eliminate the fraction. We can do this by multiplying every term by 2: `2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38`.
6. This simplifies to: `2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38`, and further simplification results in: `5x + 8 = 38`.

We need to find the price of a car in a certain year, given the initial price, the year of purchase, and the annual depreciation rate.

### Step 2: Identify the given information
- Initial price (P0) = $20,000
- Annual depreciation rate (r) = 21% or 0.21
- Number of years from 2007 to 2010 (n) = 3

### Step 3: Set up the formula for compound depreciation
Price of the car in any year (Pn) = P0 * (1 - r)^n

### Step 4: Plug in the values into the formula
P3 = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3

### Step 5: Calculate the price
P3 ≈ 20000 * 0.59344

- James gets 80 emails a day.
- 20% of these emails don't require a response.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response
- James gets 80 emails a day.
- 20% of these emails don't require a response, so 80 - 16 = 64 emails require a response.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5 day work week
- James responds to 64 emails a day.
- He works for 5 days in a week.

### 2. Next, we calculate the total number of meatballs in those 7 sub sandwiches:
   - 7 sub sandwiches/sandwich * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 28 meatballs

### 3. Mark then ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means Mark consumed:
   - 4 sub sandwiches/serving * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 16 meatballs

### 4. After Mark's consumption, there are now 28 meatballs (total meatballs) - 16 meatballs (meatballs Mark ate) = 12 meatballs left.

### 5. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. These 3 additional sub sandwiches contain:
   - 3 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sub sandwich = 12 meatballs

### 6. However, these 12 meatballs are not yet added to the previous count of 12 meatballs.

### 7. Therefore, the total number of meatballs after Sidney orders the additional 3 sub sandwiches is:

### 8. Finally, Mark eats 4 more of Sidney's sub sandwiches. This time, Mark consumes:

To find out how much Jenny would have spent on bananas if she bought them individually, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas she bought. Since she bought 10 bunches with an average of 4 bananas per bunch, she bought a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00 and contains an average of 4 bananas. So, the price per banana in a bunch is $3.00 / 4 = $0.75.

Since Jenny bought 10 bunches, she spent 10 * $3.00 = $30.00 on them.

### Step 3: Compare the costs and find the savings

Here's the reasoning:
1. **First, we need to find out how many kilograms of meat were left after the velociraptors scavenged.** Since they ate half of what was left, we multiply the final weight (270 kg) by 0.5. This gives us 135 kg.
2. **Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of meat were left after the T-Rex ate.** Since it ate half of the initial amount, we multiply the initial weight (which is what we're trying to find) by 0.5. This gives us the equation `0.5 * initial_weight = 135 kg`.
3. **Now, we solve for the initial weight.** We divide both sides of the equation by 0.5, which gives us `initial_weight = 135 kg / 0.5 = 270 kg`.
4. **However, this is not the final answer because the question asks for the weight before the T-Rex ate, not after.** Therefore, we need to account for the fact that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops.

- Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
- Ellen's brother took 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.

**Step 3: Determine the number of shaken sodas remaining**
- Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 2 shaken sodas.

**Step 4: Calculate the probability of Ellen's friend picking a shaken soda**
- The probability of picking a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.
- Probability = 2 shaken sodas / (2 shaken sodas + 9 unshaken sodas)

**Step 5: Simplify the probability**
- Probability = 2 / 11

- April has 30 days (we don't need to calculate the exact number of days for this question)

So, the total number of days is:
31 (March) + 30 (April) = 61 days

### Step 2: Calculate the number of days Billy takes off.
Billy takes off 20% of the total days.

Number of days off = Total days * Percentage of days off
Number of days off = 61 * 0.20 = 12.2

Since Billy can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round this up to 13 days.

**Step 2** - Next, we need to find out how many eggs Camden and Sarah painted together. We know that Camden painted `C` eggs and Sarah painted `S` eggs, with `C = S + 12`. We also know that together they painted 30 eggs, so `C + S = 30`.

**Step 3** - Now we have two equations:
- `A + A = 56` (because Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
- `C + S = 30` and `C = S + 12`

**Step 4** - From the first equation, we can find that `A = 28` (since `56 / 2 = 28`). So Arnold painted 28 eggs.

**Step 5** - Substituting `C = S + 12` into the equation `C + S = 30`, we get `S + 12 + S = 30`. Solving this equation, we find that `S = 9` and `C = 21`.

**Step 6** - Now we know that Arnold painted 28 eggs, Camden painted 21 eggs, and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

**Step 7** - Finally, to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted: `21 - 28 = -7`.

**Step 8** - However, since the number of eggs cannot be negative, this means that our assumption that Arnold and Madeline painted more eggs than Camden and Sarah was incorrect. In fact, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, but Arnold painted fewer eggs than both Camden and Sarah.

**Step 9** - To confirm this, we can calculate the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah (21 + 9 = 30), and the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline (28 + 28 = 56). These totals match the given information.

Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk and spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is equivalent to 2 miles.

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
Since the total walking distance is 3 miles, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
3 miles (total) - 2 miles (beach) = 1 mile (sidewalk)

### Step 3: Determine the rate of speed on the beach
Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, so her rate of speed on the beach is:
2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles/minute

### Step 4: Determine the rate of speed on the sidewalk
We know that Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, so:
Sidewalk speed = Beach speed * 2
Sidewalk speed = 0.05 miles/minute * 2 = 0.1 miles/minute

### Step 5: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk
Now, we can determine the time spent on the sidewalk by dividing the distance walked on the sidewalk by the rate of speed on the sidewalk:

- Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos collected.
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
- They divided the seashells equally among themselves.

**Step 2: Determine how many seashells Carrey collected**
- Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as C.
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2C seashells.
- Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2C + 5 seashells.
- We know Jim collected 27 seashells, so 2C + 5 = 27.

**Step 3: Solve for the number of seashells Carrey collected**
- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 2C = 22.
- Divide both sides by 2: C = 11.
- So Carrey collected 11 seashells.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 7-year-old avocado tree
- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the amount of fruits as a 5-year-old tree.
- So, a 7-year-old avocado tree produces 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old avocado tree, minus the amount produced during the 9th year
- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the amount of fruits as a 5-year-old tree.
- So, a 10-year-old avocado tree would produce 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits, but it doesn't produce any fruit during the 9th year.
- Therefore, a 10-year-old avocado tree actually produces 1000 - 0 = 1000 fruits.

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of fruits produced during the 10-year period
- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree doesn't produce any information about the amount of fruits, so we can't include it in our calculation.

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that the non-yellow portion of the mural is equal to half of the mural, we can calculate the amount of paint for each of these three colors.

- Amount of red paint: `x`
- Amount of white paint: `x`
- Amount of purple paint: `x`

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of non-yellow paint
Now, we can calculate the total amount of non-yellow paint used in the mural.

- Non-yellow paint: `x + x + x = 3x`

### Step 3: Consider the total amount of paint used in the mural
The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint. Half of the mural is yellow, so the other half consists of the red, white, and purple paints.

- Total paint: `3x + (yellow paint) = 12`

### Step 4: Subtract the yellow paint from the total paint
Now, we can subtract the yellow paint from the total paint to get the total amount of non-yellow paint.

- Total paint - Yellow paint: `3x = 12 - (yellow paint)`

### Step 5: Recall that the non-yellow paint is half of the mural
Since the non-yellow paint is half of the mural, we can express the yellow paint as the other half of the mural.

- Yellow paint: `12 - 3x`

Given that the mural is divided into two halves, the yellow paint is half of the total paint.

- Yellow paint: `12 / 2 = 6`

### Step 6: Substitute the yellow paint value into the equation
Now, we can substitute the yellow paint value into the equation from Step 4.

- `3x = 12 - 6`
- `3x = 6`

### Step 7: Solve for x
Now, we can solve for x to find the amount of red paint used.

- `x = 6 / 3`
- `x = 2`

### Final Result
There are 2 pints of red paint used in the mural.

### Step 1: Understand the problem

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40. We need to find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher's lounge.

### Step 2: Define the equation

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as x. According to the problem, we can write the equation as:
4x + 8 = 40

### Step 3: Solve for x

To solve for x, we first need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides by 4 to get x:
x = 8

### Step 4: Verify the solution

Let's verify that our solution is correct by plugging it back into the original equation:
4(8) + 8 = 40
32 + 8 = 40
40 = 40

Since both sides of the equation are equal, we can be confident that our solution is correct.

### Step 5: Answer the question

The problem asks for the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. According to our solution, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

- To find five-elevenths of 44, multiply 44 by 5/11: 44 \* (5/11) ≈ 19.45.
- Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we round this number to the nearest whole number: 19.
- So, there are 19 fish with blue stripes.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of fish with red or blue stripes**
- Add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes: 22 + 19.

   - `6 * 5 = 30` grapes

2. Next, we determine how many grapes were left after Madeline's brother made his grape juice. We subtract the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother from the total grapes at the beginning. At this point, we don't know the initial number, so we'll call it 'x'.
   - `x - 30 =` remaining grapes

3. Then, we learn that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. We can express the number of grapes used for pies as:
   - `12 * 4 =` grapes used for pies

4. We know that the remaining grapes after Madeline's brother's usage are the same as the grapes used for pies. Therefore, we can set up an equation:
   - `x - 30 = 12 * 4`

5. Solving for 'x' (initial number of grapes), we first calculate `12 * 4`:
   - `12 * 4 = 48` grapes

6. Then, we add the 30 grapes used for the grape juice to find the initial number of grapes:

1262," ### Step 1: Calculate John's new words per minute (WPM) speed

John's speed has increased by 2.5 times his original speed (150 WPM). So, his new speaking speed is:
150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

### Step 2: Determine the total number of words John needs to speak

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages. Therefore, John needs to speak:
450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

### Step 3: Calculate the time required to speak 4500 words

To find out how long it takes to speak 4500 words at his new speed, divide the total number of words by his new WPM speed:

Time = Total words / WPM
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

### Step 4: Calculate the time in minutes

The answer is given in minutes, so:

Time = 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes

The answer is:

There are 3 German Shepherds, each eating 5 kg of dog food per day. So, 3 shepherds eat 3 * 5 = 15 kg of dog food per day.
Similarly, there are 2 Bulldogs, each eating 3 kg of dog food per day. So, 2 bulldogs eat 2 * 3 = 6 kg of dog food per day.
In total, all dogs eat 15 kg (German Shepherds) + 6 kg (Bulldogs) = 21 kg of dog food per day.

**Step 2: Convert daily consumption to weekly consumption**

We know that the company produces 5000 bars per day. To find out how many bars are produced in two weeks, we first need to find out how many days are there in two weeks.

- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, two weeks contain 14 days (2 * 7).

Now, multiply the daily production by the number of days in two weeks:

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of bars by the selling price per bar.

- The selling price is $2 per bar.
- Therefore, the total revenue is:

70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

So, the company will receive \boxed{140000} for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

- Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.

We know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total, all being either chickens or cows. We are also told that these animals have a combined total of 70 legs. Our goal is to determine the number of chickens on the farm.

### <step-2> Understand the leg count for each animal type
Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.

### <step-3> Set up the equation
Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.
From the problem statement, we have two equations:
1. C + K = 20 (total number of animals)
2. 2C + 4K = 70 (total number of legs)

### <step-4> Simplify the second equation
Divide the second equation by 2, we get:
C + 2K = 35

### <step-5> Compare the simplified equation to the first equation
Now we have two equations with the same format:
1. C + K = 20
2. C + 2K = 35

### <step-6> Subtract the first equation from the second equation
Subtract the first equation from the second equation, we get:
K = 15

### <step-7> Substitute the number of cows back into the first equation
Now we know that there are 15 cows. Substitute K = 15 into the first equation:
C + 15 = 20

### <step-8> Solve for the number of chickens
Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
C = 5

### <step-9> Verify the solution
Check if the solution is valid by calculating the total number of legs:
2C + 4K = 70
2*5 + 4*15 = 10 + 60 = 70
