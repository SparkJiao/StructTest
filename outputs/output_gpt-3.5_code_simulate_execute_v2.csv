1. Read the input value of `n` which is 1.
2. Initialize two lists `xs` and `ys` with `n` elements each.
3. Read the input values for `xs` and `ys`. In this case, `xs = [0.0]` and `ys = [1.0]`.
4. Check if the product of `ys[1]` and `ys[0]` is less than 0. Since it's not, we continue.
5. Check if `good(1)` is True.

1. Take input values for `x` and `y`. As a result, we have `x = 3` and `y = 9`.
2. Check if `y` is divisible by `x`. Since `9` is divisible by `3`, we continue.
3. Update `y` by dividing it by `x`. As a result, we have `y = 3`.
4. Initialize an empty set `divs` and an empty list `to_gen`.
5. Initialize `num` to `2` and `val` to `3`.
6. Start a while loop with the condition `num * num <= val`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `num = 2`.
    - Start an inner while loop with the condition `y % num == 0`:
        - In the first iteration, we have `degree = 1` and `y = 1`.
    - Append `(2, 1)` to `to_gen`.
    - Increment `num` to `3`.
7. Append `(3, 1)` to `to_gen`.
8. Set `to_gen_len` to `2`.
9. Define a recursive function `generate` with parameters `ind`.
10. Start the recursive function `generate` with the initial value `ind = 0`.
11. Define `divs` as a list of unique divisors.
12. Sort `divs`.
13. Initialize an empty dictionary `divs_answers`.
14. Initialize `mod` to `10**9 + 7`.
15. Calculate `ans` using the `bin_pow` function with arguments `(2, 3 - 1, 10**9 + 7)`. As a result, we have `ans = 4`.
16. Iterate over each element in `divs`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `el = 1`.
    - Check if `el` is equal to `1`. Since it is, set `divs_answers[1]` to `1` and decrement `ans` by `1`.
    - In the second iteration, we have `el = 2`.
    - Calculate `curr_val` using the `bin_pow` function with arguments `(2, 2 - 1, 10**9 + 7)`. As a result, we have `curr_val = 2`.
    - Check if `el` is divisible by any other element in `divs`. Since there is no such element, continue.
    - Set `divs_answers[2]` to `2 % 10**9 + 7` and decrement `ans` by `2`.
17. Print `divs_answers[3]`.

### For main2():

1. Read the first line of input and split it to get `n` and `M`. As a result, we have `n = 7` and `M = 15`.
2. Read the second line of input and split it to get the list of integers `t`. As a result, we have `t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
3. Initialize an empty list `bucket` and fill it with zeros for each element from 0 to 100.
4. Initialize an empty list `minimum`.
5. Iterate over the range of `n`:
    - In the first iteration, we have `i = 0`.
    - Calculate the `target` as `M - t[i] = 15 - 1 = 14`.
    - Initialize `count` and `subtotal` to 0.
    - Iterate over the range from 1 to 100:
        - In the first iteration, we have `j = 1`.
        - Check if `subtotal + bucket[j] * j > target`. Since `0 + 0 * 1 = 0` is not greater than `14`, we continue.
        - Increment `count` by `bucket[j]` which is 0.
        - Increment `subtotal` by `bucket[j] * j` which is 0.
    - Append `i - count` to the `minimum` list. As a result, we have `minimum = [0]`.
    - Increment the count of `t[i]` in the `bucket`.
    - Continue the iterations for the remaining elements of `t`.
6. Print the elements of `minimum` list joined by space. As a result, we have `0`.

6. Call the `dp` function with initial arguments `0` and `0`.
7. Inside the `dp` function, we check if the current index and max_covered value are already in the cache. If not, we initialize them.
8. We call the `blah` function with the current index and max_covered values.
9. Inside the `blah` function, we check if the max_covered value is greater than or equal to `m`. If so, we return `0`.
10. If the current index is the last antenna, we calculate the answer based on the position of the antenna and the coverage.
11. If the max_covered value is less than `x - s - 1`, we calculate the number of antennas needed and recursively call the `dp` function for the next antenna.
12. If the max_covered value is not less than `x - s - 1`, we recursively call the `dp` function for the next antenna.
13. Finally, we print the result of calling the `dp` function with initial arguments `0` and `0`.

### Inputs

```

2 3 3
```

### Execution

1. Initialize `INF` to `inf`.
2. Read the values of `N` and `M` from input. As a result, we have `N = 3` and `M = 3`.
3. Create a list `to` of size `N` with empty lists. As a result, we have `to = [[], [], []]`.
4. Create a 2D list `sides` of size `N x N` with all elements initialized to 0. As a result, we have `sides = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`.
5. Read the edges from input and update `to` and `sides` accordingly:
    - Edge `(1, 2, 1)`: Update `to` and `sides` for vertices `0` and `1`.
    - Edge `(1, 3, 1)`: Update `to` and `sides` for vertices `0` and `2`.
    - Edge `(2, 3, 3)`: Update `to` and `sides` for vertices `1` and `2`.
    - After this step, `to` becomes `[[[1, 1], [2, 1]], [[1, 1], [0, 3]], [[2, 3], [0, 1]]]` and `sides` becomes `[[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]`.
6. Define the `dijkstra` function to find the shortest path tree using Dijkstra's algorithm.
7. Define the `dfs` function to traverse the shortest path tree and update the `sides` matrix.
8. Define the `main` function to iterate over all vertices and find the total number of edges that are part of the shortest path tree.
9. Call the `main` function from the `__starting_point` function.
10. Execute the `__starting_point` function.

### Output

The total number of edges that are part of the shortest path tree is `3`.

- In the first loop, `cntl` is 3:
    - The first loop appends 0 to `challengers[0]`.
    - The second loop appends 1 to `challengers[0]`.
    - The third loop appends 2 to `challengers[0]`.
- In the second loop, `cntr` is 2:

    - The second loop appends 0 to `challengers[1]`.
- In the third loop, `cntd` is 1:
    - The first loop appends 2 to `challengers[2]`.
    - The second loop appends 1 to `challengers[2]`.
    - The third loop appends 0 to `challengers[2]`.
- In the fourth loop, `cntu` is 0:
    - The first loop appends 2 to `challengers[3]`.
    - The second loop appends 1 to `challengers[3]`.
    - The third loop appends 0 to `challengers[3]`.

- The intersection of all challengers is `{}`.

- Initialize `t`, `sx`, `sy`, `ex`, `ey` with the given inputs. So, `t=5`, `sx=0`, `sy=0`, `ex=1`, `ey=1`.
- Read the string `w` as input. So, `w=""SESNW""`.

- Append a space at the end of `w`. So, `w=""SESNW ""`.
- Initialize `ans` to -1.
- Initialize `i` to 0.
- Calculate `dx` and `dy` as the difference between `ex` and `sx`, and `ey` and `sy` respectively. So, `dx=1` and `dy=1`.
- Check if the absolute sum of `dx` and `dy` is greater than `t`. Since `2` is not greater than `5`, we proceed.
- Enter the while loop.
    - In the first iteration, check if `dx` and `dy` are both 0. Since they are not, proceed.
    - Check the conditions based on the direction of `dx` and `dy`:
        - In this case, `dx` and `dy` are both positive.
        - Check the conditions for the next character in `w` and update `i`, `dx`, and `dy` accordingly.
        - Continue this process until the loop ends or `dx` and `dy` become 0.
    - If `dx` and `dy` are both 0, update `ans` to the current value of `i`.

### Execution

1. Initialize `n` to 3.
2. Initialize `a` to `[3, 3, 3]`.
3. Initialize `d` to `[0, 0, 0]`.
4. Initialize `ok` to 0.
5. Initialize `cur` to 0.
6. Calculate `len` as the LCM of 7 and 3, which is 21.
7. Iterate over the range of `0` to `7 * 3`:
    - In the first iteration, `i = 0`.
        - Check if `a[i % n]` is 0. It's not, so we continue.
        - Decrement `a[i % n]` by 1 and increment `d[i % n]` by 1.
        - Update `cur` to 1.
    - In the second iteration, `i = 1`.
        - Check if `a[i % n]` is 0. It's not, so we continue.
        - Decrement `a[i % n]` by 1 and increment `d[i % n]` by 1.
        - Update `cur` to 2.
    - In the third iteration, `i = 2`.
        - Check if `a[i % n]` is 0. It's not, so we continue.
        - Decrement `a[i % n]` by 1 and increment `d[i % n]` by 1.
        - Update `cur` to 3.
    - Continue this process until `i = 6`.
8. Since `ok` is still 0, we enter the second part of the code.
9. Initialize `k` to a large number, 10^20.
10. Iterate over the range of `0` to `3`:
    - Update `a` by adding `d` to it.
    - Check if `d[i]` is 0. It's not, so we continue.
    - Check if `a[i] % d[i]` is greater than 0. It's not, so we update `k` to the minimum of `k` and `a[i] // d[i] - 1`.
11. Update `k` to 0 if it's still 10^20.
12. Iterate over the range of `0` to `3`:
    - Update `a` by subtracting `k * d` from it.
13. Initialize `iter` to 0.
14. Initialize `cur` to 0.
15. Enter a loop:
    - Check if `a[iter]` is 0. It's not, so we continue.
    - Decrement `a[iter]` by 1.
    - Update `cur` to 1.
