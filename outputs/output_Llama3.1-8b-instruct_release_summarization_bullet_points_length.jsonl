This could potentially make spin-based devices faster and more efficient.\n\n\u2022 A concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins was proposed in 1994, with the system consisting of three conduction band electrons confined in semiconductor quantum dots.

This dynamics is often related to high-energy physics far above the electroweak scale. Once the mechanism is specified, the mass spectrum and flavor structure of SUSY particles at the electroweak scale can be determined by a small number of parameters.\n* The No-Scale type K\u00e4hler potential is a type of K\u00e4hler potential that separates the hidden sector and the observable sector. This type of K\u00e4hler potential is highly predictive, with various phenomenological consequences obtained with a few parameters.

The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors include a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range and a sharp cutoff at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cutoff and the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cutoff.\n\n\u2022 The orbital period evolution of CVs reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer and thermal relaxation. Mass transfer perturbs thermal equilibrium and expands the star, while thermal relaxation reestablishes thermal equilibrium and contracts the star back to its equilibrium radius. The minimum period occurs where the two corresponding time scales are about equal. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses.\n\n\u2022 The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to \"hide\" the spike by introducing a spread of values in the CV population. They study the effect of a form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where the angular momentum is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary. The CAML efficiency is defined as the fraction of the transferred mass that leaves the system with some fraction of the angular momentum it had on leaving the inner Lagrangian point. The authors employ a generic prescription of the effect of a CAML mechanism, avoiding the need to specify its physical nature.\n\n\u2022 The authors calculate the long-term evolution of CVs as they approach and evolve beyond the period minimum. They use the stellar code by Mazzitelli (1989), adapted to CVs by Kolb and Ritter (1992). The systems initially evolve from longer periods towards the period bounce at almost constant mass transfer rate. The minimum period increases with increasing CAML efficiency to a maximum of around 70 minutes for a certain CAML efficiency.\n\n\u2022 The authors consider the effect of tidal deformation of the secondary on the period minimum. Calculations by Renzo et al. (2002) suggest that the secondary is deformed in the non-spherical Roche lobe such that its volume-equivalent radius is around 1.06 times that of the same star in isolation.

Theoretical calculations on this topic began in the 1980s, while the first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the Aladin group. The caloric curve is a plot of temperature versus excitation energy, and it is used to study the phase transition in nuclear matter.\n* The Aladin group's experiment identified a wide plateau in the caloric curve at around 5 MeV temperature lasting from 3 to 10 MeV/nucleon excitation energy, which was associated with the possible existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. Similar experiments by EOS and INDRA groups followed, but they obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region being absent in most cases. Factors contributing to these discrepancies include the precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve.\n* The microcanonical multifragmentation model was improved by refining the primary break-up part and including the secondary particle emission. The new version of the model preserves the general aspect of the caloric curve, manifesting an important plateau-like region. The model also proves the ability of simultaneously fitting the \"definitory\" characteristics of the nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon.\n* The improved model was used to reevaluate the caloric curve for the case of the source nucleus (70, 32) and to compare it with the experimental data.

This suggests that the equivalence principle holds with accuracy at the atomic level and the gravitational field couples to every process containing radiative corrections.\n\n* To reconcile the effective description of the CCP with the ordinary quantum field theory, a radical idea is taken that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively.

By detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products.\n\n* Forward proton detectors have been proposed to be installed on either side of the interaction points of ATLAS and/or CMS, with the FP420 collaboration proposing to install detectors in the region 420 m from the interaction points.

The distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam depends primarily on the beam size at each detector location.\n\n* The cross section for the CEP of a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks is predicted to be around 1.86-7.38 fb, with the dominant decay channel changing from b-quark pairs to gluon pairs at a mass of around 130 GeV.

These models include hybrid inflation models, which involve the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields.\n* The study of multi-field models of inflation has led to the development of new techniques for renormalizing time evolution equations in single field models. The problem of renormalization of time evolution equations in single field models was understood several years ago, but the extension to multi-field models is more complicated. The authors use a formal perturbative expansion in the effective masses and time derivatives of the masses of the fields to extract the divergences of the mode integrals. This method results in a series expansion of the mode functions in powers of the effective masses and time derivatives.\n* The authors apply their formalism to a two-field case, where they study the behavior of the quantized mode functions and the effect of fluctuations on the zero mode equations of motion for various parameters. They find that the one-loop corrections to the mean field evolution can be renormalized by dimensional regularization.

The backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock is a crucial aspect, which violates the test particle approximation when the acceleration process becomes efficient. This leads to changes in the spectrum of particles and the structure of the shock.\n\n\u2022 There are three viable approaches to account for the backreaction of particles on the shock: numerical simulations, fluid approaches, and analytical approaches. Numerical simulations allow for a self-consistent treatment of several effects, while fluid approaches treat cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid. Analytical approaches provide a way to understand the physics of nonlinear effects in a complex system.\n\n\u2022 The analytical approach adopted in this work is a generalization of the method introduced in a previous study to describe nonlinear shock acceleration with monochromatic injection of quasi-thermal particles. The approach accounts for both thermal particles and seed nonthermal particles, which may be present in the region where the shock is propagating. This case is of interest for the study of supernova shocks propagating through the interstellar medium.\n\n\u2022 The nonlinear effects in shock acceleration result in the appearance of multiple solutions in certain regions of the parameter space, resembling critical systems with a bifurcation occurring when a threshold is reached. In the case of shock acceleration, it is not easy to find a way to discriminate among the multiple solutions when they appear. A two-fluid approach has been used to demonstrate that when three solutions appear, the one with intermediate efficiency for particle acceleration is unstable to corrugations in the shock structure and emission of acoustic waves.\n\n\u2022 The physical parameters that play a role in this approach to criticality are the maximum momentum achievable by particles in the acceleration process, the Mach number of the shock, and the injection efficiency, which is the fraction of thermal particles crossing the shock that are accelerated to nonthermal energies. The injection efficiency is a crucial parameter that hides a physics problem by itself and may play an important role in establishing the level of shock modification. Unfortunately, our poor knowledge of the microphysics of the shock does not allow us to establish a clear and universal connection between the injection efficiency and the macroscopic shock properties.\n\n\u2022 The analytical treatment of shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles is presented, including their nonlinear backreaction on the shock.

PT-invariant Hamiltonians, which are not necessarily Hermitian, may still give rise to completely real spectra, making them suitable for physical settings. Recent developments in optics have led to the experimental realization of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians, primarily due to the work by Christodoulides and coworkers. This has demonstrated that the controllable imposition of gain and loss can render optical waveguiding arrays a fertile territory for constructing PT-symmetric complex potentials.\n* The first two realizations made use of couplers composed of two waveguides with and without loss, or a pair of coupled waveguides, one carrying gain and the other loss. More general models of linearly coupled active and passive intrinsically nonlinear waveguides were considered earlier, and stable solitons were found in them, including exact solutions. An electronic analog of such settings has also been implemented. Configurations with a hidden PT symmetry have been identified in fine-tuned parameter regions of microwave billiards.\n* The possibility to engineer PT-symmetric oligomers, which may include nonlinearity, was an incentive to additional studies on both few-site systems and entire PT-symmetric lattices. Nonlinear PT-symmetric systems, incorporating PT-balanced nonlinear terms, have drawn considerable interest. Most of the PT-invariant systems considered thus far have been one-dimensional in nature, although the stability of solitons in 2D periodic PT-symmetric potentials has also been recently investigated. 2D arrays of optical waveguides can be readily built, hence, a natural question is whether PT-symmetric oligomers can be created in a 2D form.\n* This work aims to make a basic step in this direction by introducing fundamental 2D plaquettes consisting of four sites, typically, or a five-site cross. These configurations are inspired by earlier works on 2D Hamiltonian lattices described by discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations.

The two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year time scale, but a small fraction of numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability.

The observed white dwarf mass provides an upper limit to the mass of the core of the primary star at the moment of Roche-lobe contact, and the companion mass is constrained via the mass of the core. The planets allow us to break the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass, and derive the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase. The outer planet can be used to validate this calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born.\n\u2022 The response of the orbit of the planet to the mass loss depends on the total amount of mass lost in the common envelope and the rate at which it is lost. Numerical common-envelope studies indicate that for an in-spiraling binary, the entire envelope is expelled well within one orbital period of the inner planet, leading to an impulsive response and the possible loss of the planet.

The B20 compounds possess a helical spin structure, and the magnetic properties are governed by the interplay of ferromagnetic exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The MnSi films offer a variety of interesting magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the use of silicon as substrate material.\n\n\u2022 The benefit of thin films compared to bulk material is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to the uniaxial anisotropy. This pioneers new opportunities for data storage devices.

The magnetic ground state of MnGe is a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3 nm at lowest temperatures and 6 nm near the magnetic ordering temperature. The helix axis is due to magnetic anisotropy pinned along certain crystal directions.\n\n\u2022 Recently, a large topological Hall effect exceeding by 40 times that of MnSi was observed in MnGe, which was attributed to a skyrmion phase in analogy to MnSi.

This issue has been extensively discussed in the literature.\n\n\u2022 Three methods may help determine the degree of beaming in GRBs. The first method involves analyzing the light curve of optical afterglows from jetted GRBs, which should exhibit a break during the relativistic phase. However, detailed numerical studies show that the break is usually smooth, and many other factors can result in light curve breaks. The first method is not conclusive.\n\n\u2022 The second method involves observing the polarization of optical afterglows from jetted GRBs, which can be strongly polarized. Some positive observations have been reported, but polarization can only be observed under specific conditions. The second method is also not conclusive. The third method involves observing orphan afterglows, which are afterglows that are not associated with any detectable GRBs.\n\n\u2022 The third method was first proposed by Rhoads, who pointed out that due to relativistic beaming effects, gamma-ray radiation from the vast majority of jetted GRBs cannot be observed. However, the corresponding late-time afterglow emission is less beamed and can safely reach us. Great expectations have been put on this method, but it is still difficult to measure the GRB collimation angle. The absence of large numbers of orphan afterglows in many surveys has been regarded as evidence that the collimation cannot be extreme.\n\n\u2022 However, recent studies have shown that the measurement of the GRB beaming angle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult. The main reason is that when the afterglow emission from a jet begins to go into a much larger solid angle than the initial burst does, the optical flux density usually becomes very low. Improving the detection limit can overcome this problem. An interesting result was recently reported by Vanden Berk et al., who discovered a possible optical orphan at z=0.385.\n\n\u2022 The concept of failed GRBs (fGRBs) has been proposed, which are baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factor much less than 1000. fGRBs can produce orphan afterglows that are similar to those from jetted GRBs", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 28, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Researchers have been motivated to unveil the hidden characteristics of dark energy, which is still unknown. Modified gravity approaches, such as the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity, have been proposed to explore the salient features of dark energy. The EGB gravity is a direct generalization of general relativity in 3 dimensions and coincides with general relativity in 4 dimensions.\n\n\u2022 The EGB gravity is established by adding or replacing curvature invariants and their corresponding generic functions in the Einstein-Hilbert action. The Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant is a linear combination that is free from spin-2 ghost instabilities. The GB invariant is a topological term in 4 dimensions, which possesses a trivial contribution in the field equations. To discuss the dynamics of the GB invariant in 4 dimensions, two interesting scenarios are considered: coupling the GB invariant with a scalar field or adding a generic function to the Einstein-Hilbert action.\n\n\u2022 The first scenario naturally appears in the effective action in string theory, which investigates singularity-free cosmological solutions. The second approach, known as EGB gravity, is introduced as an alternative for dark energy, which successfully discusses the late-time cosmological evolution. This modified theory of gravity is endowed with a rich cosmological structure and is consistent with solar system constraints. The current cosmic accelerated expansion has also been discussed in modified theories of gravity involving the curvature-matter coupling.\n\n\u2022 The curvature-matter coupling in EGB gravity yields a non-zero covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor and an extra force appears, which makes massive test particles follow non-geodesic trajectories. The reconstruction and stability of cosmic evolutionary models in modified theories of gravity are captivating issues in cosmology. The reconstruction technique involves using a known cosmic solution in the modified field equations to find the corresponding function that reproduces the given evolutionary cosmic history.

MFS obey non-Abelian statistics, which is an important factor in realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing. Over the recent few years, the possibility of hosting MFS in exotic solid-state systems has focused on topological superconductors.\n\n\u2022 Currently, various realistic platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires (SNWs), and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. Although various schemes have been presented, observing the unique Majorana signatures experimentally is still a challenging task. MFS are their own antiparticles, and they are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments, in which Majoranas manifest themselves as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). The theoretical predictions of ZBPs have been observed experimentally in SNWs, which are interpreted as the signatures of MFS.\n\n\u2022 The first reason that experimental results cannot serve as definitive evidence to prove the existence of MFS in condensed matter systems is that zero-bias conductance peaks can also appear in terms of other mechanisms, such as the zero-bias anomaly due to Kondo resonance and the disorder or band bending in the SNW. The second reason is that Andreev bound states in a magnetic field can also exhibit a zero-energy crossing as a function of exchange interaction or Zeeman energy, and therefore give rise to similar conductance features. As far as we know, most of the experimental evidences for Majorana bound states largely rely on measurements of the tunneling conductance at present, and the observation of Majorana signature based on electrical methods still remains a subject of debate. Identifying MFS only through tunnel spectroscopy is somewhat problematic.\n\n\u2022 To obtain definitive signatures of MFS, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFS are necessary.

This dusty medium absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the energy in the infrared.\n\n\u2022 Type 1 AGN show significantly more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity, which is consistent with the picture where the face-on view onto the torus in Type 1 AGN exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer.

This anisotropy is expected to be smaller if the dust is arranged in clouds rather than being smoothly distributed.\n\n\u2022 The use of high-spatial resolution observations can help to resolve out the host galaxy and isolate the AGN emission, but it is difficult to set up representative samples due to observational limitations.

PTC can be regarded as a middle ground between integrating accurately and calculating the steady state directly.\n\n* The long-term stability model for power systems can be represented as a semi-explicit index-1 DAE system, and PTC can be applied to this model with modifications to make the initial condition consistent. The proposed algorithm for PTC in the long-term stability model involves switching back to implicit integration method whenever discrete variables jump.\n\n* Numerical examples show that PTC can successfully provide correct stability assessment for the long-term stability model and overcome numerical difficulties in the QSS model, as well as offer good accuracy for the intermediate trajectories. PTC can be regarded as a good in-between method with respect to integration and steady state calculation, serving as an alternative method in power system long-term stability analysis.\n\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 14, "symbol": "*"}}

However, non-perturbative effects in M-theory have been shown to allow unstable de Sitter vacua.\n* The paper reviews the equations of motion for multi-scalar cosmologies and derives a useful alternative criterion for the acceleration of the scale factor.

The acceleration equation is derived by differentiating the Friedmann constraint and using the scalar field equation.\n* The paper considers the possibility of fixed points in the system of equations, which correspond to power-law cosmologies. The fixed point conditions are derived on the assumption that the potential is constant and the covariantly constant vector is constant.

The first cosmological surveys using SCUBA and MAMBO quickly changed the accepted picture of galaxy formation and evolution. The discovery of SCUBA galaxies was greeted with surprise due to the remarkable evolution in the dusty, starburst galaxy population. Early reports suggested that the majority of the submm population had no plausible optical counterparts.\n* Recent progress in the study of SMGs has been largely due to radio imaging of submm survey fields. Early radio follow-up detected roughly half of the submm sources observed, with an astrometric precision of 30.3 arcsec. Radio data also enabled some refinement of submm samples, increasing the detection fraction to two-thirds of SMGs at 0.85-mm flux density levels. The study of SMGs has provided some of the strongest tests of galaxy-formation models to date.\n* The study of SMGs has been limited by confusion and selection biases. A detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion currently limits investigations to the brightest SMGs. The study of SMGs has been challenging due to the lack of sufficiently deep radio data and the limited coverage of red and IR wavelengths in spectroscopic surveys.

However, they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, leading to tachyonic states. The original solution to this problem is to add a universal mass to the scalars, rendering them positive. This results in the minimal AMSB model having a parameter space of m_0, m_3/2, m_13, and sign().\n\u2022 An alternative setup for AMSB is the hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMS) model, which uses a similar setup but with a strongly warped hidden region. This model suppresses contributions from tree-level gravity mediation and allows anomaly mediation to become the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking. The HCAMS model predicts a negative mass-squared for the sleptons and relatively heavy squarks. The parameter space of the HCAMS model is given by m_0, m_3/2, m_2, and sign().\n\u2022 The HCAMS model has been implemented in the ISASUGRA subprogram of the event generator ISAJET v7.79, which solves the MSSM RGEs for the 26 coupled renormalization group equations. The model predicts a large left-right splitting of scalar masses, with the third generation squarks being highly split. The light third generation squarks are expected to be generically lighter than the gluino mass, leading to cascade decays producing large multiplicities of b and t quarks. The HCAMS model also predicts a mixed wino-higgsino neutralino state for large values of m_2.\n\u2022 The HCAMS model has been compared to the minimal AMSB model, with the latter predicting a negative mass-squared for the stops and sbottoms. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions. The HCAMS model predicts a large reach for the LHC, with a reach to 42 TeV (corresponding to 43 TeV) for low values of m_2. The reach for large m_2 is similar to the reach for low m_2 in the bino-gaugino and wino-gaugino channels.\n\u2022 The HCAMS model has been studied in detail, with the authors computing the expected sparticle mass spectrum, branching fractions, production cross sections, and collider events.

The anomaly can be interpreted as an infrared phenomenon, which is related to the chiral limit and the presence of a singularity in the absorptive part of the triangular diagram. This interpretation is complementary to the more familiar ultraviolet one, which emerges from the renormalization procedure.\n* The axial anomaly can be derived by studying the properties of the amplitude in the infrared region, and it is connected to the presence of a non-conservation of helicity. This non-conservation becomes a non-conservation of chirality in the massless limit, which is a manifestation of the axial anomaly. The anomaly can be related to the presence of a term independent of the fermion mass in the corresponding cross sections.\n* The cancellation of mass singularities in the decay rates for the radiative pion and Z decays is a crucial aspect of the axial anomaly. The KLN theorem guarantees that these divergences cancel out if we sum the transition probability over the set of degenerate states, order by order in perturbation theory.

A new dataset, Judd-A, has been created to address this issue, containing 900 images with multiple objects and eye movement data.\n* The Judd-A dataset has been used to train and evaluate a simple baseline salient object detection model, which involves two stages: fixation prediction and segmentation.

The device is designed to restore both a patient's vision and natural range of accommodation. The intraocular lens device comprises two lens portions: a first lens portion that provides most, if not all, of the accommodative power and a second base lens that provides most, if not all, of the corrective refractive power. The first lens portion is elastically deformable and responds to the contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscles by changing shape or by displacement along an optical axis.\n\n\u2022 The first lens portion is made of an elastically deformable material and comprises opposing sides that are joined together at the periphery to define a bi-convex exterior shape and an internal enclosed cavity. Each of the opposing sides comprises a central region and a peripheral region with a gradient of thickness that increases radially from the peripheral region to the central region. This thickness profile encourages deformation of the opposing sides away from one another and permits the opposing sides to bulge and increase its curvature in opposing directions along an optical axis. The central region has a thickness that is two times or more, preferably three times or more, and most preferably four times or more than the thickness of the peripheral region.\n\n\u2022 The base lens is coupled to the lens chamber via a lens periphery and is preferably more rigid than the opposing sides of the lens chamber. The base lens is made of a material having a higher elastic Young's modulus than the lens chamber and does not substantially change its shape and curvature in response to the radially-compressive accommodative force applied onto the peripheral edge.

The tube is inserted into the esophagus to a depth wherein the electrode is disposed out the lower end of the esophagus into the stomach. The external electrode is mounted on the chest of the patient, and the controls, etc. are properly set. The operator moves the slide to the right, which causes the pin to move downwardly in the tube.\n\n\u2022 Further movement of the slide in that direction causes the distal portion of the tube to deflect and place the electrode in proximity to the upper stomach wall near the heart ventricle.

The invention aims to provide a new sulky construction that can be manufactured using light metal and other lightweight materials.\n\n\u2022 Conventional sulkies have been manufactured as welded steel constructions, which have led to the most lightweight construction combined with sufficient strength. However, attempts to build sulkies using aluminum have failed due to poor strength qualities and difficulties in welding. The conventional design is unsuitable for light metals, requiring welding, which is a major drawback.\n\n\u2022 The manufacturing process of conventional sulkies has been expensive and labor-intensive, and storing and transportation have been difficult due to the sulky's awkward shape. Specialists in the field have been convinced that still lighter sulkies could not be manufactured without a corresponding strength reduction. The invention aims to overcome these limitations by providing a new sulky design.\n\n\u2022 The object of the present invention is to provide a new sulky construction that can be manufactured using light metal and other lightweight materials. A further object is to provide a sulky that can be assembled easily by a user himself, from substantially flat elements requiring only a small space during storage and transportation. The sulky should be inexpensive to manufacture and easy to assemble.\n\n\u2022 The sulky according to the present invention has a stable construction, with the shafts and crossbar transferring substantially all the load to the wheel planes only.

The sulky should be able to withstand the specific strain during exercise and competitions.\n\n\u2022 The sulky has a weight reduction of approximately 40% compared to conventional sulkies, with a total weight of approximately 18 kg in a ready-to-use state. The sulky is designed to be colored by applying color tapes in all recesses of the profiles, providing an inexpensive and individual color display system. The sulky is particularly designed for use in trotting races.\n\n\u2022 The sulky has a symmetrical design, with the end frames arranged symmetrically related to the plane of the wheels.

The jacket unit is connected with the retaining part, for one, across an energy absorption connection, which comprises at least one bending wire or strip that, upon a displacement of the jacket unit with respect to the retaining part parallel to the longitudinal direction toward the motor vehicle front, is deformed. The invention further relates to a method for the production of such a steering column. The steering column is preferably implemented such that it is adjustable in length.\n* A first embodiment of the invention is depicted in FIGS. 1 to 8. The steering column comprises a jacket unit which bearing supports a steering shaft rotatably about the longitudinal axis of the steering shaft. The jacket unit is connected with a retaining part across a break-away connection and energy absorption connection. The break-away connection can be realized, for example, via a shear bolt. The energy absorption connection serves a bending wire or strip, which is connected, on the one hand, with the retaining part, on the other hand, with the jacket unit.\n* The bending wire or strip is elastically deformed during assembly of the steering column, e.g. it is deformed with respect to a neutral position which it assumes without external forces, wherein it exerts a reset force in the direction of the neutral position. The bending wire or strip is comprised of an adequately elastic material, for example a spring-elastic steel. Through this elastic prestress of the bending wire or strip, the jacket unit is prestressed with respect to the retaining part relative to a displacement parallel to the longitudinal axis in the direction toward the motor vehicle front.

The invention aims to reduce frictional wear on components and improve durability and efficiency. The coated swash plate may be made from lower-cost alloy materials while maintaining performance. The invention is particularly useful for automotive air conditioning systems.\n* Swash plate compressors have been used in automotive air conditioning systems for many years. In a swash plate type compressor, a swash plate rotates about a shaft, and a number of pistons are arranged radially about the perimeter of the swash plate. The facial and end surfaces of the swash plate contact pivoting shoes within the pistons. The rotation of the swash plate reciprocates the pistons.\n* The reciprocating swash plate has a relatively high surface area that contacts the piston shoes, causing a large amount of friction. The rotating swash plate undergoes a shear-type contact with the piston shoes, which wears away many types of friction-reducing coatings. The interfacial surfaces between the swash plate and pistons are subject to very high load conditions and are susceptible to premature wear. Protecting these surfaces from wear increases the life of the compressor and also increases the compressor efficiency.\n* It is known to coat the surface of an aluminum swash plate to reduce wear. Coatings as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,056,417 include 50% by weight of tin and lesser portions of copper, nickel, zinc, lead, and indium to form a metal matrix coating. These electroplated coatings require that the base material have a highly polished surface to provide maximum durability. The high silicon aluminum and tin metal matrix coating gives the coated swash plate increased durability but at the expense of frictional resistance.\n* To enhance the frictional properties of the electroplated swash plate, the 5,056,417 patent teaches the use of a solid lubricant such as fluororesin as part of the metal matrix coating. The fluororesin was added to the aqueous solution used in the chemical plating process. While the fluororesin coating provided a swash plate with a lower coefficient of friction, the surface coating layer exhibited a lower hardness than the tin matrix coating alone and was more susceptible to rapid abrasion. The electroplated metal matrix coatings on aluminum components are acceptable under light loads but have several disadvantages when used under high friction loads.\n* The present invention is directed to a sw", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 40, "symbol": "*"}}

This process is particularly useful for the synthesis of pyrazolotriazoles, which are useful magenta couplers for photographic products.\n\u2022 The traditional method of synthesizing pyrazolotriazoles involves a two-step process: a ring contraction reaction to form 1-acetyl-7-acetylthio-3,6-disubstituted-1H-pyrazolo[5,1-c]-1,2,4-triazoles, followed by hydrolysis and desulfurization with hydrochloric acid. However, this method generates elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities, which can interfere with subsequent reaction steps.\n\u2022 The use of hypophosphorous acid in the deacylation and desulfurization step reduces the amount of elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities formed, resulting in a higher yield of the desired product. This process also generates hydrogen sulfide as a by-product, which can be easily removed from the reaction zone.\n\u2022 The process involves reacting an acylated compound with an aqueous mixture of hypophosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid to produce hydrogen sulfide and the desired pyrazolotriazole.

The invention is particularly useful in high-rise apartment and office building construction.\n\n\u2022 Modern construction techniques require the erection of safety barriers or guard rails around the perimeter of uncompleted floors for personal safety and to prevent the accidental dislodgement of articles. The general practice involves the use of lengths of lumber stock, such as 2\u2033\u00d74\u2033 boards, which are cut to length and nailed together in varying patterns. However, this method is time-consuming, requires more than one person, and often results in the destruction of materials.\n\n\u2022 Various structures have been proposed to aid in the construction of temporary safety barriers, but most are impractical, expensive, and too complicated to use. As a result, a need exists for a portable and simple guard rail system that meets safety guidelines and can be assembled and disassembled efficiently. The present invention aims to address this need.\n\n\u2022 A portable guard rail support and assembly for use in erecting a safety barrier is provided, comprising a substantially flat bottomed base plate, an upright column, at least one guard rail support bracket, a kick board retaining flange, an angular brace, and a safety tie-off ring.

The disclosures of these applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The invention relates to sensors, particularly position and motion sensors. The invention aims to improve the efficiency and reliability of position sensors in mechanical systems.\n* Many mechanical systems contain moving parts that need to be monitored and controlled for safe or efficient operation. A prime example is the operation of diesel engine fuel injectors, which are controlled either hydraulically or electrically. The timing and speed of fuel injection depend on the characteristics of the fuel being used, especially biodiesel fuels. This makes it challenging to monitor and control the injectors accurately.\n* Mechanical systems like internal combustion engines contain a significant number of moving objects, such as fuel injectors, that need to be monitored. Each injector requires a separate sensor, which adds cost and weight to the system. A method of reducing the number of wires required for these systems is to provide output signals in the form of changes in current drawn by the sensor. This allows the sensor to operate with only two wires, one for operating voltage and current, and another for ground reference.\n* Position sensors used to monitor moving objects generate an electrical signal proportional to the distance between the object and a fixed position. However, unwanted electrical signals, known as noise, are also generated along with the desired position signal. Noise signals are divided into low-frequency and high-frequency noise, with high-frequency noise being easily filtered out. Low-frequency noise, on the other hand, is more challenging to eliminate.\n* Most position sensing transducers generate low-frequency noise in the form of a slowly drifting or static DC offset. This noise can cause problems in employing two-wire current output position sensors, as it adds to the temperature of the devices in the sensor, reducing its reliability. The addition of a static or DC current through the output sensing resistor increases the voltage dropped across the resistor, wasting power and requiring a higher power capability for resistors. This also means that the sensor wires must be increased in diameter to accommodate the increased power lost through their series resistance.\n* The present invention is directed to sensing position or movement of an object. A position sensor signal conditioner and remotely electrically connected sensor monitoring equipment provide a method of multiplexing multiple numbers of sensors on a minimum number of wires with a minimum of energy required from each sensor monitoring", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 40, "symbol": "*"}}

These materials have very little inherent damping or vibration dissipation characteristics, which can lead to high vibration levels that compromise instrument functionality. This is particularly concerning for instruments mounted on precision kinematic mounts (KM) that have very little inherent damping.\n* The vibration/shock related failures in spacecraft launches are a significant concern, with 14% of launches suffering from such failures between 1984 and 1984, resulting in 50% of these failures being catastrophic mission losses. The need to identify and develop additional vibration reduction techniques for instruments is essential. The current efforts to define graphite structure modifications may not be sufficient to bring already developed instruments within their design levels.\n* The conventional designs of kinematic mounts have met with limited success, as they are designed to safely carry launch loads but have no provisions to minimize loads transmitted to the instrument. The six suspension modes introduced by the mounts are expected to have very little damping, amplifying flight loads to the mounted instrument. The need for a kinematic mount with a passive energy dissipating mechanism to protect the instrument from potentially damaging flight loads is essential.\n* The present invention aims to provide kinematic mounts that incorporate novel damping features and a passive energy dissipating mechanism to protect the instrument from potentially damaging flight loads. The kinematic mounts have been modified by inserting vibration damping materials into the mounts, which introduce a damping mechanism into the six mount suspension modes.

A design rule check (DRC) is a well-known process for inspecting whether mask pattern data of a semiconductor integrated circuit is correctly designed in compliance with fabricators' topological layout rules (TLR). The TLR are unique to each fabrication facility, based on available process technologies, equipment limitations, etc. An example of prior art DRC system is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,132 incorporated by reference herein.\n* The conventional methods of checking design rules have several disadvantages, including the need for manual checking and the possibility of false errors. A first conventional method involves writing a design rule check command file by referring to a Foundry's Topological Layout Rule document (TLR), which typically only consists of so-called \"Logic Rules\" applicable to a logic section of a chip under consideration. However, this method assumes the memory blocks used are DRC clean and that the interfaces between the memory and logic parts satisfy logic rules. Consequently, it will not detect any real errors in such features.\n* The present invention provides a solution to the disadvantages of the conventional methods by applying the right set of rules to the right regions of the mask pattern data. The customized design rules are based on modifying a standard set of Logic Rules as needed to reflect the needs of particular regions in the chip. A system and method of checking design rules to determine whether or not a logic part of a mask pattern data obeys logic rules and the memory part obeys memory rules are provided. This method helps users filter out false errors due to logic rule checks in a memory block and further helps pinpoint real design rule errors in the mask pattern data.\n* The present invention ensures that all types of memory regions have to fulfill all memory rules of their group, and all logic regions have to fulfill logic and memory rules. The process is superior to prior art techniques in that it avoids false errors and is more reliable, more efficient, etc. The output of this process is a design rule check result file that consists of only real logic and real memory errors.

The undiffracted light from a WGH illuminator never enters the instrumentation or the eye of the viewer due to the total internal reflection at the waveguide surfaces.\n\n\u2022 However, WGHs have some penalties, including alignment of the laser beam being critical, which can lead to certain lack of ruggedness, and nonuniformity of the diffracted wavefront along the propagation direction, which can be compensated for by exposing a photographic emulsion to the beam without compensation.

The foil electron multiplier is designed to amplify an incident electron flux or detect particles such as photons, ions, electrons, and the like. The invention can be used in photomultiplier tubes and particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates. The foil electron multiplier is particularly useful in electron spectrometers, mass spectrometers, and photonic detectors.\n* The foil electron multiplier comprises a series of thin foils held by foil holders in an evacuated enclosure that form discrete multiplication stages.

The voltage on each stage can be applied using electrical resistors or separate power supplies.\n* The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, transmission through the support grid, and secondary electron emission yield. The gain is represented by Equation 2, which takes into account the probability of incident particle transmission, secondary electron emission yield, and transmission through the foil and support grid. The gain is also affected by the number of stages in the multiplier. The foil electron multiplier exhibits an intrinsic rejection of ion feedback at each stage.\n* The foil electron multiplier design includes a range of foil dimensions from 0.5 cm diameter to 2\u00d74 cm2, with a preferred embodiment of a round 1 cm diameter foil.

The directional properties of antennae and the processing of phase and amplitude information from separate antenna elements have long been used for determining the angle of arrival of signals. However, low elevation angles are difficult to measure due to interference from strong unquantifiable reflections from the ground.\n\n\u2022 A unique equi-spaced triplet arrangement of similar antenna elements was identified in U.K. Patent No. 1449196, which can be used to determine a function of elevation angle independent of the unknown ground reflection coefficient. The prior art of UK 1449196 is illustrated in FIG. 1, showing a single equi-spaced triplet for which the two R.F. outputs A+C and B are functions of the elevation angle \u03b8 and the ground reflection coefficient p. The quotient of (A+C) and B is independent of a, p, r, h, and P.\n\n\u2022 At low elevation angles, the ground reflection coefficient p approximates to -1, and the function S simplifies to S=f'(a, P, r)sin(2\u03c0h sin\u03b8/\u03bb). The measurement of elevation angle can only be made when S is non-zero, and is best made when S is changing slowly with angle near its maximum value. The value of h may be chosen to maximize the amplitude of S.\n\n\u2022 The invention extends the ideas of the prior art to optimize angle measurements using the triplet itself, notably over selected sectors at low elevation angles. The array may operate in a receive mode or a transmit mode, in which case the transmitted signal from each antenna in the array must be coded so that it can be identified.

The invention aims to provide a solution that will provide a much longer bulb life by combating the mechanisms of bulb degradation. The solution should also help provide further protection from burns for users, regardless of the type of appliance in which the bulb is used.\n\n\u2022 Small incandescent lamps, especially subminiature lamps, have a glass envelope which has traditionally been supported by a one or two piece base. The base typically has a low pitch thread for providing mechanical fixation to a socket, as well as for providing a conductor for one conductor of a two conductor subminiature lamp element. In most subminiature lamps of this type conduction for the other conductor is provided through a peg conductor centered in an insulator carried at the bottom-most part of the lower base.\n\n\u2022 The upper glass envelope has to be supported. Normally a metal sleeve is employed which fixes movement of the conducting leads, aligns the envelope with respect to the sleeve, and permanently supports the glass envelope throughout its life. Current practices for holding a subminiature lamp in a metal housing employs a ceramic adhesive between the glass envelope and the inside of a metal support sleeve.\n\n\u2022 The use of an adhesive to support the glass envelope within a metal sleeve has a number of problems. First, this adhesive eventually breaks down from repetitive use of the subminiature lamp due to the thermal cycling between the high temperature of the lamp's operating temperature and its return to room temperature. The subminiature lamp temperature can be as high as 300\u00b0 C.\n\n\u2022 Secondly, the use of any material to bond a glass envelope having a low thermal expansion characteristic to what is typically a metal sleeve having a much higher thermal expansion coefficient will cause a destructive shear each time the subminiature lamp is thermally cycled. This shearing movement, combined with other factors hastens the degradation of the adhesive material used within a subminiature lamp. The combination of the above four factors works together to cause conventional subminiature lamps to fail at an unacceptably high rate.\n\n\u2022 The invention utilizes a high temperature polymer which directly surrounds and is in compression contact with the glass envelope. The polymer may preferably derive support from a metal base. The polymeric material is somewhat rigid/molded and can be manually handled and used to manipulate the subminiature lamp.\n\n\u2022 The", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 27, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The invention provides a method and system for generating a mobile time reference for a portable transceiver. The mobile time reference is used to maintain the timing of the portable transceiver and to recover multipath signals. The invention is particularly useful in 3G wireless communication systems.\n\n\u2022 The invention includes a free running counter (FRC) that generates the mobile time reference using a high frequency clock and a low frequency clock. The FRC is coupled to a temperature controlled crystal oscillator (TCXO) and a crystal oscillator (CO). The TCXO provides a 30.72 MHz clock signal, while the CO provides a 32 KHz clock signal. The FRC uses the 30.72 MHz clock signal to generate the mobile time reference in active mode.\n\n\u2022 The FRC operates in two time domains, 30.72 MHz and 32 KHz, depending on whether the portable transceiver is in active mode or idle mode. In idle mode, the TCXO is turned off, and the FRC uses the 32 KHz clock signal to maintain the mobile time reference. The FRC provides a timing reference for the portable transceiver system and for acquiring the parameters required to recover the multipath signals. The mobile time reference is constantly running and has an accuracy of approximately 32 nanoseconds.\n\n\u2022 The FRC includes a TCXO circuit, a phase locked loop (PLL), a counter, a drift estimator, and a correction circuit. The TCXO circuit generates the mobile time reference using the 30.72 MHz clock signal. The PLL phase locks the 32 KHz clock signal to the 30.72 MHz clock signal for improved performance. The counter counts the cycles of the 32 KHz clock signal.\n\n\u2022 The drift estimator provides an estimate of the drift of the 32 KHz clock signal for use by the correction circuit. The estimate of drift includes both the drift and bias of the clock as provided by a Kalman estimation. The correction circuit updates the mobile time reference using the count and the drift estimate. The mobile time reference is maintained during the idle mode.\n\n\u2022 The invention includes a WCDMA modem that receives the digital signal from the receiver baseband analog processor (BAP) and provides a digital signal to the transmitter BAP.

{"idx": 392, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\n\n\u2022 The invention pertains to the field of scraped surface heat exchangers, specifically the mounting of blades onto the central drive shaft. The blades are used to mix and scrape the inside surface of the outer tube in a scraped surface heat exchanger. The blades are typically hingedly connected to the central drive shaft and are restrained by pins. The pins are welded onto the drive shaft and have a narrow protruding finger and an opposed wider finger.\n\n\u2022 The blades are generally installed on the drive shaft at a time when the drive shaft is removed from the outer tube of the scraped surface heat exchanger. Installation occurs not only at initial setup but also after each cleaning cycle of the device. During insertion of the drive shaft into the scraped surface heat exchanger tube, it is desirable that the blades remain at a shallow angle. The blades need to be held at their relatively shallow angle during installation so that they fit within the diameter of the outer tube.\n\n\u2022 In the case of a horizontally and vertically arranged scraped surface heat exchanger, this practice may be somewhat cumbersome and require tying strings around the blades to hold them in. The blades may be accomplished by the user holding the blades in with their hands as the drive shaft is inserted into the outer tube. Due to the length of a drive tube, there are typically several blades arranged at regular intervals longitudinally along a single drive shaft. The blades are generally arranged with four blades, each at a 90\u00b0 angle to each other, around the circumference of the drive tube.\n\n\u2022 If the blades are permitted to swing outwardly to their installation position, they may be able to freely slide away from the pin. This problem becomes even more severe in the case of a vertically arranged scraped surface heat exchanger. In order to permit a shaft to fit within a tube of the same length, it is known to mount the tubes quite high above the floor surface.

Some providers offer basic life support (BLS) services, while others offer advanced life support (ALS) services.\n* The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found that ambulance providers with higher costs tend to have higher Medicare margins, which may be due to increased resources and less pressure to control costs. Providers with lower transport volumes tend to have higher costs per transport due to high fixed costs for maintaining readiness. The median cost per ground ambulance transport for providers in the sample was $429 in 2010, ranging from $224 to $2,204. Personnel costs accounted for the largest percentage of total costs in 2010.\n* The increase in ambulance transports from 2004 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in BLS nonemergency transports, which rose by 59 percent. Super-rural areas experienced the largest increase in BLS nonemergency transports (82 percent). The introduction of the national fee schedule in 2002 may have contributed to increased billing, and improper payments were cited as one potential cause of the increase in ambulance utilization.

As a result, Ginnie Mae securities command a higher price and offer a lower yield than other MBS of government-backed loans.\n\n\u2022 Ginnie Mae has several different products, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and Multiclass Securities Program. Ginnie Mae I requires that all pools contain similar types of mortgages with similar maturities and interest rates. Ginnie Mae II permits pools to contain loans with more heterogeneous loans, such as adjustable rate mortgages.\n\n\u2022 Ginnie Mae's share of the total MBS market has declined over the last 20 years, both in terms of new issuances and volume outstanding. This decline is due to the growth of the conventional MBS market, which has become more prevalent in recent years. Ginnie Mae's share of the MBS market for government-backed loans would likely decline only if other secondary market players chose to become more active in the securitization of these loans.\n\n\u2022 Ginnie Mae's outstanding volume of MBS has declined in recent years because the outstanding volume of FHA and VA loans has fallen as growing numbers of borrowers refinance in the conventional market. This decline has led to a corresponding decline in the outstanding volume of Ginnie Mae securities. Ginnie Mae's share of the government-backed mortgage market has been fairly constant.\n\n\u2022 Ginnie Mae faces challenges in a number of areas, including responding to changes in the marketplace and meeting the needs of its stakeholders. To meet this challenge, the agency has expanded its product offerings and taken other initiatives to maintain its viability. Ginnie Mae must also adequately disclose loan information that MBS investors need to assess prepayment risk.\n\n\u2022 Ginnie Mae's fee income is based on the principal balance of its securities portfolio, so the agency's revenues largely depend on the volume of its outstanding securities.

The auditor has a responsibility to both the audited taxpayer and all other taxpayers to conduct a quality audit. IRS uses nine audit standards to define audit quality, which have evolved since the 1960s.\n\n\u2022 The nine audit standards address several issues, such as the scope, techniques, technical conclusions, reports, and time management of an audit, as well as workpaper preparation. Each standard has one or more key elements, and workpapers provide documentation on the scope of the audit and the diligence with which it was completed. Workpapers assist in planning the audit, record procedures applied, tests performed, and evidence gathered.\n\n\u2022 Audit workpapers provide support for technical conclusions and provide the basis for review by management. They also provide the principal support for the auditor's report, which is to be provided to the audited taxpayer, on findings and conclusions about the taxpayer's correct tax liability. The primary tool used by IRS to control quality under the nine standards is the review of ongoing audit work.\n\n\u2022 IRS' first-line supervisors, called group managers, are responsible for the quality of audits done by the auditors they manage. They review audit workpapers during the audit to identify problems with audit quality and ensure that the problems are corrected. After an audit closes, IRS uses its Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS) to collect information about the audit process.\n\n\u2022 EQMS staff review audit workpapers and assess the degree to which the auditor complied with the audit standards.

The problem is exacerbated by budget pressures, changing work requirements, and a potential wave of employee retirements.\n\n\u2022 The federal compensation system is outdated and does not align with modern compensation principles, which prioritize skills, knowledge, and performance. The current system rewards length of service rather than individual performance and contributions, and provides automatic annual pay increases to all employees, including poor performers. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement among federal employees.\n\n\u2022 The federal workforce has become more highly skilled and specialized, but the GS classification system, which was created in 1949, is not equipped to address these changes. The system has not kept pace with the government's evolving requirements, and its inherent tension between attributes can have significant implications for pay and personnel management. To address this issue, OPM has recommended modernizing the classification system and developing a strategy to track and prioritize occupations for review and updates.\n\n\u2022 Effective performance management is critical to addressing poor performance and ensuring that agencies can meet their missions. However, our work has shown that many agencies struggle with performance management, and that supervisors often do not use probationary periods to evaluate new employees' performance. To address this issue, OPM has recommended educating agencies on ways to notify supervisors that an individual's probationary period is ending and that the supervisor needs to make a decision about the individual's performance.\n\n\u2022 To improve human capital management, agencies must identify options to meet their missions with fewer resources and leverage the tools and flexibilities available to them.

This means there will be fewer than three working-age individuals for every person 65 or older. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is due to both the growing number of older individuals and the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers.\n* Social Security retirement policy changes could strengthen incentives to work longer, such as eliminating the reduction of benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age. The delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is also being increased. These changes aim to remove the disincentive to work.\n* The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) promotes the employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age and prohibits age discrimination in employment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces ADEA and other federal statutes prohibiting employment discrimination. However, ADEA only applies to firms with 20 or more employees.\n* Pension benefits are a key source of retirement income for many workers and can influence their work decisions.

The federal government plays an important role in financing foster care and establishing minimum procedural requirements for the placement process.\n\n\u2022 The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes and to provide services to the family and the child with the goal of reuniting them. If reunification is not possible, the state must find permanent placement for the child outside the family home. States must develop a case plan for each child, which must be reviewed at least every 6 months.\n\n\u2022 Some states have implemented laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing, with 26 states enacting such laws or policies. A majority of these states require the hearing within 12 months, while two states require it within 6 months for children under age 6. The remaining 24 states and the District of Columbia have statutes consistent with the federal requirement of 18 months.\n\n\u2022 States have implemented various operational and procedural changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, including low-cost, creative methods for financing and providing services that address specific barriers to reuniting families. Arizona's Housing Assistance Program, for example, focused on families in which the major barrier to reunification was inadequate housing. The program resulted in 939 children being reunited with their families between 1991 and 1995.\n\n\u2022 Some states are experimenting with concurrent planning, which involves working toward reuniting a family while developing an alternate plan for permanently removing the child if reunification efforts fail. This approach can expedite the permanent placement process and reduce the time children spend in foster care. Colorado began using concurrent planning formally in 1994 for children under age 6.\n\n\u2022 States have also focused on expediting the process by which parental rights can be terminated, with Arizona and Kentucky placing special emphasis on this issue.

To supplement the information provided by its staff, SSA publishes several pamphlets that explain the provisions of the DI and SSI programs. Two of these publications provide information about the effect of work on DI and SSI benefits.\n\u2022 Concurrent beneficiaries, who comprise about 14 percent of SSA's disability population, are likely to have mental impairments and be female, with an average age of 45. Approximately 11 percent of concurrent beneficiaries work and have a median earned income of about $250 a month. More than three-quarters of those who work have mental impairments, with individuals with mental retardation working at twice the rate of beneficiaries with mental illness.

Over half of concurrent beneficiaries have a mental impairment, with a third having mental illness and about a quarter having mental retardation. Approximately one-ninth of concurrent beneficiaries have an impairment related to their muscular or skeletal system. The remaining beneficiaries have one of a wide range of impairments as their primary impairment.\n\u2022 Concurrent beneficiaries who work are more likely to have mental retardation, tend to be younger, and male, with workers with mental retardation having median monthly earnings of about $200.

Claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers. Intermediaries process claims from hospitals and other institutional providers under part A while carriers process part B claims.\n\n\u2022 The intermediaries' and carriers' responsibilities include reviewing and paying claims, maintaining program safeguards to prevent inappropriate payment, and educating and responding to provider and beneficiary concerns. Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs. Most federal agencies generally may contract with any qualified entity for any authorized purpose, but Medicare is authorized to deviate from this under provisions of the Social Security Act.\n\n\u2022 Medicare is authorized to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) under provisions of the Social Security Act enacted in 1965. This allows Medicare to select intermediaries and carriers in a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association. Currently, there are three intermediary contracts, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\n\u2022 The Social Security Act also generally calls for the use of cost-based reimbursement contracts under which contractors are reimbursed for necessary and proper costs of carrying out Medicare activities but does not expressly provide for profit. Medicare contractors cannot be terminated from the program unless they are first provided with an opportunity for a public hearing. This process is not afforded under the FAR.\n\n\u2022 Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms, including freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks. Allowing Medicare to have contractors specialize in specific functions rather than assume all claims-related activities could lead to greater efficiency and better performance. Authorizing Medicare to pay contractors based on how well they perform rather than simply reimbursing them for their costs could also result in better program management.\n\n\u2022 The number of Medicare contractors has dropped by more than half since 1980, leaving the program with fewer choices when one contractor withdraws or is terminated. The agency has repeatedly submitted legislative proposals to repeal the provider nomination authority and make explicit its authority to contract for claims administration with entities other than health insurers.

Overall, FSA field offices in 16 of the 26 states reviewed made less than one-half of the required determinations of their estates from 1999 to 2005. Eligibility determinations could also uncover other problems, such as individuals receiving program payments through multiple entities. This lack of consistency makes it difficult for FSA to ensure that program funds are spent as economically, efficiently, and effectively as possible.\n\n\u2022 FSA sometimes approved eligibility for payments when the estate had provided insufficient information.

The changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in certain parts of the country, have increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons. The average number of days in the fire season increased from approximately 200 in 1980 to approximately 300 in 2013. The projected climate changes suggest that western forests in the United States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur more frequently.\n\n\u2022 The Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC) is an intergovernmental committee that provides strategic oversight to help ensure policy coordination, accountability, and effective implementation of long-term strategies to address wildfire preparedness and suppression. The WFLC is responsible for implementing the Cohesive Strategy, which emphasizes the importance of coordination across multiple agencies through an \"all lands approach\" and frames comprehensive goals that may mitigate wildland fire risk. The Cohesive Strategy has three goals: resilient landscapes, human populations and infrastructure can withstand wildfire without loss of life or property, and all jurisdictions participate in developing and implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire management decisions. The strategy calls for a set of national outcome measures to assess progress in meeting these goals.\n\n\u2022 Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce the risk of wildland fire before a potential wildland fire incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. Fuel reduction can occur through mechanical treatment or planned ignitions, which often replicate the positive effects of naturally occurring wildfire. Federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities to prioritize, plan, and conduct fuel reduction activities. Federal initiatives involving such projects include the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program and the Reserved Treaty Rights Lands Program.\n\n\u2022 Joint planning, including prioritizing and developing community plans and regularly sharing information regarding wildland fire issues in person, has enhanced collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Developing annual operating plans between federal and nonfederal entities has been helpful for collaborating on fire preparedness activities. Developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs) has also enhanced collaboration, as CWPPs provide a structure for collaboration and building community capacity.

However, the territories have been afforded greater flexibility, including the ability to set their own income eligibility levels for certain populations and determine income eligibility using a locally established poverty level instead of the federal poverty level. This flexibility allows the territories to tailor their Medicaid and CHIP programs to their unique circumstances.\n\n\u2022 The funding for Medicaid and CHIP in the territories differs significantly from the states, with the federal matching rate for the territories not recognizing their capacity to pay for program expenses. The Medicaid FMAP for the territories is fixed at 55 percent, which is lower than the range available to states. In contrast, the federal government matches states' and territories' CHIP program spending at a rate higher than Medicaid, known as the enhanced FMAP. However, the territories' matching rate for CHIP spending is also fixed at the lower end of the range available to the states.\n\n\u2022 The territories' Medicaid and CHIP funding is subject to a statutory cap, which means that once their funding is exhausted, they must assume the full costs of their programs. This cap has contributed to lower federal and territory Medicaid program expenditures in the territories.

Analysis of tax filer data is informing discussions about itemized tax deduction reform.\n\u2022 Itemized deductions are optional and can be claimed by tax filers who have aggregate itemized deductions greater than the standard deduction.

The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years, with some changes attempting to reestablish symmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses. The current tax system allows for the deduction of capital losses against ordinary income, but with a limit of $3,000 per year. This limit was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from minimizing their income tax liabilities by altering the timing of the realization of gains and losses.\n* The tax treatment of capital gains and losses is asymmetrical, with long-term gains taxed at a maximum rate of 15% and long-term losses deductible without limit against short-term capital gains and net long-term losses. This asymmetry allows taxpayers to time their gains and losses to minimize their income taxes. For example, a taxpayer can realize and deduct losses in one tax year at 35% while waiting until the next tax year to realize and pay taxes on gains at 15%. This creates an incentive for taxpayers to sell assets with losses and hold assets with gains.\n* The empirical evidence indicates that capital gains income is heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges, and it is probable that large capital losses are also concentrated in the same income ranges. Taxpayers in the middle income ranges tend to hold capital gains-producing assets as part of tax-favored retirement savings plans, which are not affected by the net loss restrictions. The benefits of increasing the net loss deduction would tend to accrue to taxpayers in the upper income ranges. This is because the tax benefits of an increase in the net capital loss limitation would be received by a relatively small number of higher income individuals.\n* The current tax system allows for an unlimited carry forward of excess losses, which means that taxpayers do not forfeit the full value of excess losses because they can deduct those losses in future years. The actual cost to the taxpayer of forgoing the full loss in the current year is the interest that would have been earned on the additional tax reduction that would have been realized had there been no excess loss limitation. For example, a taxpayer with a net long-term capital loss of $20,000 can deduct the entire loss against other income in the first year and reduce their income tax liability by $7,000. However, if the taxpayer had no net capital gains in any subsequent year, it would take seven years to deduct the full $20,000 capital loss.\n* The tax treatment of capital", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 36, "symbol": "*"}}

The system has coevolved with market conditions and different risks have emerged.\n\n\u2022 The 2008-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy. The crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory system had serious weaknesses. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in 2010 to strengthen regulation and address risks. The Basel III Accords were also agreed upon to make certain bank regulations more stringent.\n\n\u2022 The regulatory system involves prudential regulation, consumer protection, and restrictions on permissible activities. Prudential regulation includes requirements such as capital ratios, liquidity requirements, and asset concentration guidelines. Consumer protection involves laws and regulations to protect consumers from deceptive or unfair practices. Restrictions on permissible activities aim to reduce banks' riskiness and prevent them from engaging in excessive speculation.\n\n\u2022 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established to regulate consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has a single mandate to implement and enforce federal consumer financial law. The CFPB's regulatory authorities vary based on whether a bank holds more or less than $10 billion in assets. The CFPB's rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authorities are divided between the CFPB and prudential regulators for smaller banks.\n\n\u2022 The \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) problem refers to large banks that are believed to be so important to the country's financial system that the government would save them if they became distressed. TBTF banks may have incentives to be excessively risky and gain unfair advantages in the market for funding. Enhanced prudential regulation aims to reduce the likelihood of large bank failure through measures such as higher capital ratios and liquidity standards.

These programs aim to achieve various forest management and protection goals, including wildfire response and wood product development. The Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) primarily administers these programs with the assistance of state partner agencies.\n* Providing federal assistance for nonfederal forest landowners has been a component of USDA's programs for over a century.

The Forest Service (FS) has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance.\n* The Senate and House Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry in general, forestry assistance, and forestry research programs. Congress authorized specific forestry assistance programs in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924, which guided these programs for over half a century. The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (CFAA) revised the law, and the 2008 farm bill established national funding priorities and a standardized process for states to assess forest resource conditions.

The 2008 farm bill expanded the definition of authorized conservation practices for agricultural conservation programs to include forestry practices. This allows for direct federal financial assistance to private forest landowners through conservation programs.\n* To be eligible to receive funds for most programs, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, which includes a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term statewide forest resource strategy.

Farmers respond to high prices by boosting output, but when prices drop, they are not quick to cut back production. Contributing to the unstable nature of the farm economy are weather, export demand, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and farm support and export subsidy programs of foreign competitors. Typically, farmers do not view the eventual self-correcting character of commodity prices and production with the same equanimity as economists.\n* Between 1973 and 1995, a prominent form of counter-cyclical aid was deficiency payments linked to target prices. Congress specified an annual per-unit target price for each major crop, and eligible producers received a deficiency payment if the market price was below the target price. This aid was ended by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996. Under Title I of the 1996 Act, fixed production flexibility contract (PFC) payments replaced target price deficiency payments.\n* The PFC payments were not linked to either current production or prices, and lawmakers intended that these fixed payments, along with the ability to make unconstrained planting decisions, would cause the market place to guide farmers' production choices. However, the 1996 law did continue another form of counter-cyclical support: marketing assistance loans. Producers could pledge their stored grain, cotton, or oilseeds as collateral for a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) nonrecourse commodity loan after harvest.

The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.\n\u2022 The experimental conditions achieved the same plasma level of EMPs as seen in human clinical disease (110 per ml). However, there are significant limitations to the model presented, including the relative volume of human circulation to CVVH circuit and the saturable nature of EMP clearance. The observed EMP clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, which would explain the relatively constant EMP concentration from 40 to 70 minutes.\n\u2022 The authors suggest that frequent changing of the CVVH filter may overcome the limitation of EMP sequestration within the filter or tubing.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Prognostic and therapeutic options for HCC are dependent upon the severity of underlying liver disease, with a median overall survival of 58 months for metastatic or locally advanced disease. HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes.\n\u2022 The HGF-CMET pathway plays a critical role in HCC development and progression, with overexpression of HGF and MET observed in 33% and 20-48% of human HCC samples, respectively. The HGF-CMET axis is implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including aberrant paracrine or autocrine ligand production, overexpression of HGF and MET, and upregulation of genes encoding proteases for HGF-CMET processing. The HGF-CMET pathway is also modulated by the activation of other receptor tyrosine kinase families, including EGFR, IGF-1R, and RAF kinase. Targeted disruption of the HGF or MET genes results in embryonically lethal knockouts with impaired organogenesis of the liver and placenta.\n\u2022 Inhibition of the HGF-CMET pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy in HCC, with several small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in development, including tivantinib, cabozantinib, and foretinib.

The study group consisted of PAD patients treated either surgically or pharmacologically, and blood samples were collected before surgery and after 35 days and 710 days. The results showed that patients before surgery had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of MDA, and that statin therapy relieved symptoms and improved function in patients with lower extremity PAD.

Descent of the fetal head, progressive ossification of the skull bones, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios are limitations affecting the sensitivity to detect central nervous system pathology. Advances in MRI technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology have led to an increasing role for MRI in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies.\n* The first reported use of fetal MRI dates back to 1989, and most studies have addressed the additional role of MRI in the diagnosis and characterization of fetal anomalies detected on ultrasound. The emphasis has been on central nervous system pathology, and MRI has become an adjunct to ultrasound for cases diagnosed with ventriculomegaly. Ventriculomegaly is a condition where the maximal diameter of the atrium of the lateral ventricles exceeds 10 mm.\n* The prevalence of ventriculomegaly ranges between 0.3-1.5%, and the severity can be classified as mild (10-12 mm), moderate (12-15 mm), and severe (>15 mm). Another classification system is based on measuring the thickness of the overlying brain parenchyma. Measurement of the lateral ventricle is subject to errors due to off-axis image planes, angled measurements, or improper choice of ventricular boundaries.\n* Ventriculomegaly has a wide range of causes, including an imbalance between the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, abnormal cerebral development, and destructive disease processes. Unilateral ventriculomegaly is more often seen in destructive processes, whereas developmental anomalies are more characterized by bilateral broadening of the ventricles. The reported incidence of additional anomalies goes up to 70-85%.\n* Fetal MRI is mainly performed on 1.5 Tesla scanners, and no adverse health effects have been demonstrated in either the fetus or the mother after short-term exposure to electromagnetic fields. The HASTE sequence is the most commonly used sequence, combining short acquisition times with good signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. T1-weighted imaging is often used to detect hemorrhages or calcifications.\n* MRI scans have a big field of view and can be obtained in any given plane, but the major limitations are the impact of fetal motion on image acquisition and its relatively low spatial resolution.

There are different types of biomarkers, including DNA biomarkers, DNA tumor biomarkers, and general biomarkers. DNA biomarkers are generally measured in the blood, while DNA tumor biomarkers are measured in tumor tissue.\n* Diagnostic biomarkers are used to determine the diagnosis or severity of a disease, while prognostic biomarkers help to predict the likely course of disease in a defined clinical population under standard treatment conditions. Predictive biomarkers predict the likely response of a patient to a special treatment in terms of efficacy and/or safety. For example, the IL28B gene is a strong indicator for response to standard treatment in patients with hepatitis C virus-1 (HCV-1) infection.\n* The development of diagnostic tests undergoes a similar process as the development of new drugs, with four phases: phase I, phase II, phase III, and phase IV. In phase I, the diagnostic test must be demonstrated to be safe and well understood, while in phase II, the test is validated in a retrospective study. In phase III, the test is validated in a prospective study, and in phase IV, the test is evaluated for its impact on clinical outcome.\n* The validation of biomarkers requires a clear understanding of the underlying biology and the development of robust and reproducible assays. The use of biobanks for prospective validation may play a role for already approved drugs, but the material must be available for systematic investigations into improved efficacy or safety in biomarker-defined subgroups.

The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed with the development of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, which is significantly more effective in preventing progressive vision loss than previous alternative treatment modalities. Anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to significantly improve visual acuity (VA) in many patients with neovascular AMD or other retinal diseases.\n* The current management of neovascular AMD involves the use of continuing anti-VEGF treatment to control signs of exudation by blocking the growth of abnormal blood vessels to prevent vision loss and potentially improve VA.

The results showed that the addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the construct, regardless of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used. The intermediate screw provided a 3-point fixation of the fractured segment, which increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation. This increase in stiffness was more significant for the monoaxial screw construct.\n\u2022 The study found that the short-segment construct with polyaxial pedicle screws had significantly greater range of motion in flexion and extension compared to the monoaxial screw construct. However, the addition of intermediate screws at the level of the burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation, regardless of the type of screw used. The polyaxial screw construct created more security by permitting better contact and holding strength between the screw head and the rod. This resulted in higher resistance to rotational slippage between the rod and the screw head.\n\u2022 The study used a calf spine model to simulate an unstable burst fracture and tested the flexibility of the construct using a pre-injury and dropped-mass technique. The results of the study may not be directly applicable to human patients, but they provide a biomechanical rationale for using an intermediate screw at the level of fractured vertebrae with posterior short-segment fixation. The study had some limitations, including the use of a small number of cases and the lack of comparison with long-segment fixations and application of the cross-link.

In nature, activation of hydroxy groups often proceeds through enzymatic phosphorylation by kinases or sulfation catalyzed by mammalian sulfotransferases. However, the requirement for molar equivalents of these cofactors in synthetic applications is problematic from a scale-up perspective. Enzymatic ATP recycling is feasible, but PAPS cannot be recycled efficiently.\n\n\u2022 An efficient alternative to kinases is the use of ATP-independent phosphatases using cheap inorganic polyphosphates as activated phosphate donors. This approach circumvents the need for cofactor recycling and is environmentally benign. Phosphatases usually display a broad substrate spectrum, but the reversibility of phosphate transfer causes undesired hydrolysis of the newly formed phosphate ester. A kinetically tightly controlled system is required to minimize hydrolysis.\n\n\u2022 The use of phosphatases for synthetic applications dates back to the late 1940s, but progress was slow due to the reversibility of phosphate transfer. Recent studies have identified acid phosphatases from enteric bacteria as efficient catalysts for the phosphorylation of various alcohols. These enzymes have a broad substrate spectrum and can be used in combination with aldolases to synthesize natural and unnatural sugar molecules. However, the selection of suitable phosphatases and reaction conditions is crucial to achieve high product titers.\n\n\u2022 A range of alcohols was investigated, including primary and secondary mono and dihydroxy compounds, as well as cyclic substrates. The three enzymes, phonsf, phonse, and piacp, proved to be efficient catalysts in the phosphorylation of various alcohols, with phonsf generally delivering the highest product titers. The presence of a phosphate group in the proximity of the reacting hydroxy moiety determines whether an diol undergoes bisphosphorylation. Haloalcohol 5 was also converted, with phonse tolerating higher substrate concentrations than phonsf and piacp.\n\n\u2022 The chemoselectivity of the enzymes for o vs. n and snucleophiles was corroborated by the non-acceptance of substrates 11 and 12.

Charles Elton's book on the subject in 1958 did not inspire a broad research thrust or public response. It wasn't until the mid-1980s that an international project by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) engaged prominent scientists worldwide and triggered an explosion of research on invasions. This research revealed the great extent and variety of impacts of introduced species.\n* The SCOPE project led to a surge of research on how non-native species interact with native species, including eating, competing with, or infecting them. This research showed that impacts of introduced species are more varied and widespread than previously thought. Two new lines of research have become prominent: impacts at the ecosystem level and genetics and evolution. Molecular genetic research has revealed a great number of cases of the \"stealth\" impact of invaders, hybridization, and introgression with native species.\n* Research on ecosystem-level impacts has increased greatly, particularly in the new century, showing how a single introduced species can change processes or the physical structure of an ecosystem. This can affect a large fraction of the resident species, sometimes subtly and slowly. The study by Fukami et al. on impacts of introduced species is a notable example. Molecular genetic research has also revealed that substantial introgression can occur even between native species that never hybridize when a newly introduced species constitutes a genetic bridge between them.\n* Introgression can cause substantial evolution of native species, as in the European wildcat, which hybridizes with feral domestic housecats. Hybridization between native and introduced species can even produce new, more invasive species. The best-known example is common cordgrass, Spartina anglica, an invader that arose in England from hybridization between native S. maritima and North American S. alterniflora. Molecular genetic features such as microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been used to trace sources and routes of invasions.\n* Introduced populations often combine genes derived from multiple source populations, producing novel genetic combinations. Some introduced populations arising from multiple sources have more genetic variation than any single source population.

The most dangerous characteristic of melanoma is its ability to spread widely over the body via the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. Early diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for the prognosis of the disease.\n* Dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that links clinical dermatology and dermatopathology by enabling the visualization of morphological features not discernible by examination with the naked eye. Different techniques, such as solar scan, epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), cross-polarization epiluminescence (XLM), and side transillumination (TLM), can greatly increase the morphological details visualized. Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis compared to unaided eye, with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 10-30%. However, it may lower diagnostic accuracy in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists.\n* The diagnosis of melanoma is highly dependent on subjective judgment and is scarcely reproducible. Several scoring systems and algorithms, such as the ABCD-E rule, the seven-point checklist, and the Menzies method, have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance. These systems have shown problems that have not yet been solved, including low within- and between-observer concordance.

Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2D, which is often the result of a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.\n* The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC-1) gene is a multifunctional regulatory factor involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, beta-cell insulin secretion, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and glucose transport in muscle. Genetic association studies have shown that the associations of PGC-1 loci with T2D were found in different populations. The estrogen-related receptor-alpha (ESRRA) protein binding PGC-1 protein can regulate the expression of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) gene by stimulating the activity of the MFN2 promoter. ESRRA is a vital regulator involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, adaptive energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism.\n* The MFN2 gene is a mitochondrial fusion protein that regulates mitochondrial morphology and distribution.

The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) were proved in several observational and experimental studies. The lipid-lowering action of n-3 PUFAs was detected at the beginning, so these nutrients were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.\n\n\u2022 The beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs include anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects. Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The induction of inflammation may well provide a link between hyperlipidemia and atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease featured by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through the disease progression.\n\n\u2022 In physiological conditions, endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins and maintain a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading towards an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by monocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes.

Early recognition of all parasite carriers bearing various disease symptoms and parasite rates is crucial for achieving malaria elimination.\n\n\u2022 Active surveillance by precise laboratory methods in endemic areas provides an appropriate tool for detection of all kinds of infections, particularly asymptomatic ones containing low parasite densities. Asymptomatic malaria infections were described in hyper-endemic regions following frequent infective bites and repetitive immune system response toward the parasite attenuating parasitemia to undetectable levels in blood smear. The prevalence of this kind of malaria infection was determined by means of different laboratory techniques in various endemic countries previously.\n\n\u2022 The aim of this study was to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections by means of three malaria diagnostic tests (microscopy, RDT, and nested-PCR) in a low transmission region of Bagh-e-Malek in Minab district, Hormozgan province, southern Iran. The study was performed as a cross-sectional survey in Bagh-e-Malek region, which is located in Minab district, southeast of Hormozgan province. A total of 200 healthy volunteers were participated in this study from Bagh-e-Malek area.\n\n\u2022 The study used three diagnostic methods: microscopy, RDT, and nested-PCR. Microscopy is the most commonly used method of malaria diagnosis as the gold standard in Iran, but it has limitations associated with this method. Chromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are introduced in remote settings, where microscopic diagnosis is either impractical or unfeasible.\n\n\u2022 The results of this investigation showed that no Plasmodium parasite was detected in any examined sample using microscopy and RDT tests. However, nested-PCR amplification found three P. vivax positive samples (1.5%) in asymptomatic individuals. These cases were considered as asymptomatic malaria patients since", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

A 7-14 day course of antibiotic therapy, typically parenteral ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin, is usually prescribed. \n* * Recent reports have shown emerging patterns of resistance to empirical antibiotics, making the early choice of antibiotics a more challenging decision. The criticalness of the issue lies in the fact that early diagnosis and treatment can prevent long-term consequences and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. \n* * Clinical manifestations of UTIs in neonates are mostly non-specific and of a systemic nature, including fever, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, growth failure, abnormal urination, and jaundice. The non-specific presentations often make UTIs hard to diagnose, with reported prevalence ranging from 4-25% in very low birth weight infants to 0.1-1% in term infants. \n* * UTIs in newborns can lead to urosepsis or neonatal sepsis, which is why they are often managed as a case of sepsis.

The genomic landscape may seem featureless, but it holds rich veins of knowledge awaiting exploitation. Surveying and signposting this landscape can guide investigators towards experiments that address specific hypotheses about gene function.\n\n\u2022 Different communities of biologists speak in dialects that are not always mutually comprehensible, particularly with respect to the umbrella term 'function'. To address this, universal vocabularies are needed to annotate genes and make their functions accessible to all scientific communities. Websites such as LocusLink, GeneCards, and Ensembl integrate information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes.\n\n\u2022 There are two common ways of annotating genes: empirical observations and predicted evolutionary relationships. The latter relies on homology, where genes that arose from a common ancestor are defined as homologs, paralogs, or orthologs. Homologous gene products often have similar functions, making homology a valuable tool for predicting gene function.\n\n\u2022 The importance of annotating the genomic landscape on the basis of homology lies in its ability to infer similar tertiary structures and functions among protein homologs. However, homology assignment indicates only an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function. It is essential to note that homology is defined on the basis of evolution, rather than function.\n\n\u2022 Domain architectures are a key aspect of protein evolution, and domains are homologous portions of sequences that have survived the evolutionary tests of time without fragmentation. Domain families can be predicted using resources such as Pfam, SMART, and InterPro, which provide a vocabulary for protein evolution. These resources have been used to annotate the human genome draft sequences.\n\n\u2022 The proportion of the proteome that can be annotated using these resources is low, at approximately 40-60%. However, protein sequences can be identified by their component domains rather than protein or gene names, providing a more evolutionary lens on gene function. This approach implies that a gene product's function is a synthesis of the generalized functions of its component parts.\n\n\u2022 The study of domain families has also played a major role in understanding the evolution of chordates, with significant differences detected between the repertoires of human domain families and those of other organisms. The complexity of organisms is loosely coupled to total gene number, and the question of whether the number of representatives of a domain family in a proteome is directly related to that family's contribution to cellular and organismal function remains open.

The lung epithelial lining is composed of pseudostratified, simple columnar, and cuboidal epithelium, each with distinct stem cell populations. Proximal airways contain tracheal basal cells that are pluripotent and express keratin-5 (K5).\n* In the trachea, basal cell populations expressing either K5 or K14 are capable of the functional aspects of stem cell niches.

The most important complication of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which directly relates to lack of immunity during pregnancy. Rubella vaccination is crucial to prevent CRS and its complications. By vaccinating all susceptible people or women in reproductive age, it is possible to prevent the disease in mothers and their fetuses.\n\u2022 The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital infection with the rubella virus and CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries. The disease is spread globally, and before the vaccination era, its attacks were most common between February and April in countries without effective childhood vaccination policies. In closed populations, such as military camps or prisons, the possibility of infection is minimized. Rubella is usually rare in infants born from IgG-positive mothers due to antibody transfer.\n\u2022 The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the RA27/3 virus strain, which induces more immunity compared to other vaccines. The immune response is more similar to the immunity after natural infection, and one dose induces seroconversion in 95% of vaccinated persons. A variety of seroepidemiological studies have been done globally to evaluate the situation of protective antibodies and assess the need for vaccination against the rubella virus. For example, in Australia, the rubella vaccination was established for schoolgirls since 1971, and CRS was significantly decreased thereafter.\n\u2022 In Iran, a study was conducted in 2006 to evaluate and compare the susceptibility and resistance of Kermanshahi girls at marriage before and after mass rubella vaccination.

Gene-specific RNA probes are now extensively used to visualize gene expression patterns and provide valuable information regarding the role of specific genes during development. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a widely used technique that has been simplified with the use of nonradioactive probes. This technique is commonly used in developmental research labs and has diverse applications, including medical and prenatal diagnostics.\n\u2022 The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts has several advantages over chromogenic methods, including higher quality three-dimensional imaging and multiplexing different RNA species. However, the high endogenous background fluorescence of many embryos and the limited brightness and photostability of organic fluorophores are major limitations. Quantum dots (QDs) have been used recently in several systems for detection of proteins and in vivo for protein labeling and lineage tracing. QDs have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission and longer excited state lifetime.\n\u2022 The use of QDs for in situ hybridization has several advantages, including wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, and resistance to photobleaching. However, commercially available QDs are quite large and suffer from permeability problems, which can limit their use in whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments. Proteinase K treatment can render xenopus embryos sufficiently permeable to allow QD penetration deep within embryonic tissues. This treatment enables specific deep tissue staining and can be used in conjunction with QD-based in situ hybridization protocols.\n\u2022 The use of QDs in in situ hybridization experiments has been shown to provide highly specific staining of dig-labeled mRNA probes, even in deep tissues. QDs can also label alternative modified oligonucleotide probes through biotin-streptavidin and FITC-anti-FITC interactions. The QD in situ protocol can be used to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously, and the resolving ability of this method is substantially better than that of amplified protocols. This is evident in high-magnification images of whole-mount-stained embryos showing the intracellular mRNA localization for xa-1 and ltbp1.\n\u2022 The QD in situ protocol has several advantages over traditional in situ hybridization methods, including the ability to remain localized and fluorescent for more than an hour after the embryo is cleared.

Physiological needs are the physical requirements for survival, such as food and sex, while safety needs are personal security, financial security, and health and well-being. Maslow proposed that if physiological needs are relatively satisfied, safety needs emerge, and the organism may be dominated by them. Safety needs are more fundamental than physiological needs, as seen in the example of a deer that cannot eat on the wild prairie when wolves chase it.\n\n\u2022 Maslow's theory is supported by the work of Cosmides and Tooby, who propose that emotions serve to regulate behavior. Fear, for example, is an emotion that serves to regulate behavior in response to potential threats. The example of walking alone at night and hearing rustling in the brush illustrates how fear can prepare the body for action. This fear response is automatic and can override other needs, such as physiological needs.\n\n\u2022 The safety needs can block physiological needs, as seen in Miller's avoidance and approach experiments. In these experiments, animals were more sensitive to threatening information and processed it faster than rewarding information. This phenomenon is known as negativity bias and is attributed to a protective strategy through evolution. Negativity bias can be seen across all levels of the neural organization.\n\n\u2022 Maslow used infants as an example to illustrate the safety needs, as they prefer a predictable and orderly world. Injustice or inconsistency in the parents can make a child feel anxious and unsafe. This attitude is not due to the injustices themselves but because they threaten to make the world look unreliable or unsafe. Confronting new or unfamiliar stimuli can elicit danger or terror reactions in children.\n\n\u2022 The appraisal theory, proposed by Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus, states that emotions result from people's interpretations and explanations of their circumstances. Primary appraisal is a faster, automatic process that involves evaluating the threat or harm of a situation. Secondary appraisal is concerned with coping options, such as blame or credit, coping potential, and future expectations. The primary appraisal is related to fear, while the secondary appraisal is related to anger.\n\n\u2022 The amygdala is the neural basis for fear and is also recognized as the neural basis for stress-elicited fear and anxiety.

SAA is also associated with chronic diseases, including RA, and may play a pathogenic role in the proinflammatory cascade.\n* SAA is not only an acute-phase protein but also an apolipoprotein relevant in cholesterol metabolism, and its increased levels can impair the protective function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Elevated SAA levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and atherogenesis, and may increase the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). SAA is also the precursor of amyloid A protein, which can deposit in major organs and lead to secondary amyloidosis.\n* The study aimed to assess the concentration of SAA in RA patients with different disease activity and to evaluate its association with clinical and laboratory variables. The study group consisted of 140 RA patients, and the results showed that SAA concentration was significantly higher in men than in women. SAA levels were also higher in patients with high disease activity and in those treated with glucocorticoids.\n* The study found a direct relationship between SAA and RA activity, with both clinical and laboratory parameters of activity. SAA levels were significantly higher in patients with plaques as a manifestation of advanced atherosclerosis and in those with increased cystatin-C (cys-c) levels as an early marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results suggest that SAA could be considered as a biomarker associated with both the current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications.\n* The study also found that SAA levels were inversely correlated with the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration, and that patients with normal SAA levels had a normal QTc duration. The results suggest that high SAA concentrations may be associated with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. The study population consisted of consecutive patients with RA treated in the department, and the detailed characteristics of patients were considered in all aspects of RA pathology.\n* The study had some limitations, including the use of different biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and the lack of detailed information about ongoing treatment.

There is a well-established association between stress and allergic diseases, including asthma. Glucocorticoids, which are an essential part of systemic stress responses, play a role in promoting inflammation and may promote Th2-type immunity.\n* Glucocorticoids can promote the production of eosinophils, which are an important feature of human asthma and murine allergic asthma models. Eosinophil production is increased in the bone marrow in response to allergen challenge, and this effect is antigen-specific and can be abolished by inducing oral tolerance to the allergen. The effects of oral tolerization on bone marrow neutrophils and eosinophils can be duplicated by the transfer of splenic T lymphocyte subpopulations from tolerized/sensitized/challenged donors to histocompatible naive recipients. These observations highlight the importance of acquired cellular immunity in regulating the hematological response to allergen sensitization and challenge.\n* Perforin is a major mediator of cellular immunity and is expressed in lymphocyte populations that fight viral and bacterial pathogens.

Polyhalite was first described from the Salt Mine Bad Ischl-Perneck in Austria by the German chemist Stromeyer in 1818. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria in 1970 and later confirmed in 2005. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by a reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70\u00b0C.\n\n\u2022 Polyhalite is a minor but widespread and important constituent in the Haselgebirge M\u00e9lange, a tectonically mixed evaporite succession at the stratigraphic base of the Northern Calcareous Alps. Polyhalite is associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides in evaporites. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255\u00b0C to a maximum of 343\u00b0C under laboratory conditions.

Each of these structures can be dynamically regulated during development, and perturbations in these folding units are associated with multiple diseases and cancer.\n\n\u2022 TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions. The TAD structures range from 100 kb up to 1 mb in size and are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions. The replication timing, the presence of different histone modifications, and the expression of the genes inside a TAD are highly correlated.

Although a relationship between TAD boundaries and the binding of insulators has been demonstrated, the effects of enzymes that modify or remodel chromatin are largely unknown.

An alternative to the molecular approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance, which involves the inter-relationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). Edholm's experimental studies revealed no correlation between EE and EI in any single day, but there was a good correlation over 2 weeks.\n\n\u2022 The largest component of total daily EE is resting metabolic rate (RMR), which is quite uniform across the day and between days. RMR is the major contributor to EE, accounting for about 60-70% of total daily EE, with fat-free mass (FFM) being the major contributor. FFM is strongly correlated with meal size and daily EI.\n\n\u2022 Prolonged exercise displays a dual-process action by stimulating hunger and increasing post-prandial satiety signaling through an effect on GI peptides. RMR is also strongly correlated with objectively measured self-determined EI, which could be expected from the recognition that FFM is the largest contributor to RMR. The physiological demand is created by the need to provide energy to maintain the functioning of the body's vital systems.\n\n\u2022 The proposed formulation for appetite control involves a tonic drive for food arising from FFM and RMR, which is under tonic inhibition from leptin. Leptin insensitivity occurs as the amount of adipose tissue increases, reducing the tonic inhibition. The drive to eat is periodically interrupted and suppressed by episodic signals in the form of peptides released from the GI tract in response to food consumption.\n\n\u2022 The recognition that FFM and", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

In mammals, it was previously believed that neurogenesis only occurred during embryonic life, but recent studies have shown that neuronal regeneration occurs even after birth in specific tissues. This process is essential for the repair and regeneration of damaged neural tissues.\n* The olfactory epithelium is a unique tissue that contains heterogeneous populations of epithelial cells, including support cells, nerve receptor cells, and progenitor cells. These cells have the ability to differentiate into neurons and non-neuronal cells, making them ideal candidates for neural regeneration. The olfactory epithelium is also capable of regenerating completely without any loss of function.\n* Researchers have been searching for an ideal cell with the properties of absolute totipotency and regenerability in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have shown that the transplantation of pure stem cell populations is insufficient for attaining maximum positive effects of neural regeneration. A complex of cells, including olfactory ensheathing cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and olfactory epithelial multipotent stem and progenitor cells, is required for more complete recovery of structure and sensory and motor functions.\n* The olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with possible neuropotency, including globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs). GBCs are small, round, morphologically non-descript cells that proliferate at a high rate in the normal olfactory epithelium. They are limited to the olfactory epithelium and are poorly characterized at the molecular level.\n* Studies have shown that GBCs are the cell population that multiplies and regenerates vigorously after epithelial damage. They function as broadly multipotent progenitors capable of giving rise to neurons and all cell types of the epithelium, making them totipotent stem cells of the epithelium. Marker studies using antibodies that are selective for GBCs in normal epithelium suggest that GBCs are differentiating into non-neuronal cell types.\n* The transplantation of adult animal and human olfactory epithelial cells has been used in the past for experimental and clinical correction of spinal injuries.

Numerous studies have found that pain is associated with significant limitations in daily activities, physical activities, and poor self-rated health. Pain is also associated with an increased prevalence of depressive disorders. Studies have demonstrated that primary care physicians tend to underestimate the intensity of pain symptoms in patients with depression.\n* The coexistence of depression and pain has been shown to be a major risk factor for opioid misuse, and healthcare providers must have an increased awareness of this connection. Optimizing antidepressant therapy and pain self-management in primary care patients may result in improvement of both depression and pain. Dolotest, a validated pain- and health-related quality of life assessment tool, has been developed to provide a shared understanding of the patient's situation. The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which Dolotest is useful as a screening tool for depression in primary care.\n* The study included 715 patients who were asked to fill in the Dolotest and Major Depression Inventory questionnaires. The study found that 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression, and 26.8% of patients whose visit was due to pain met depression criteria. The prevalence of depression was statistically significantly higher for both genders in the group visiting primary care physicians because of a pain problem.

The BHH services were able to identify gaps in care, such as laboratory monitoring or missed diagnoses.\n\u2022 Preliminary data indicate that the use of BHH services may be particularly useful in identifying gaps in care and allowing for the delivery of preventative and individualized proactive care. The data for the 33 patients with type 2 diabetes are mixed, with 12% improving to be within the recommended guidelines for HbA1c levels and 21% showing improvements in their HbA1c levels. However, 6% of individuals who were originally considered to be in the prediabetes range moved into the diabetic range.\n\u2022 The BHH may provide a cost-effective way to provide patient-centered care that helps identify gaps in somatic care for individuals with SMI and provide this population with much-needed interventions. A Center for Disease Control and Prevention diabetes prevention program group has been started within the mental health clinic, and closer monitoring of clinician practice is being done. Future research examining the utility of BHH services would benefit from investigating both a clinical and a control sample.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15, "symbol": "\u2022"}}
{"idx": 794, "result": 1, "generated": "<summary>\n\n\u2022 The American demographer and sociologist Valerie Oppenheimer wrote a series of influential articles emphasizing the role of men's socioeconomic position in demographic change, particularly in declining marriage rates and the tendency to postpone or forego marriage. Her theory was initially met with skepticism, but it has since gained support from empirical research.\n\n\u2022 Oppenheimer's theory focuses on men's economic position, arguing that men's economic uncertainty and instability are key factors in delaying marriage. This is in contrast to other theories that emphasize women's economic independence or cultural changes.\n\n\u2022 Oppenheimer's theory has been tested in various studies, including a multi-nation project led by Hans-Peter Blossfeld, which found that men's economic characteristics, such as employment and income, have a significant impact on union formation in European countries. The study also found that men's economic position is less important in more egalitarian societies.\n\n\u2022 The study used data from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and found that men who are not yet settled in their career postpone union formation. The study also found that cohabitation is less sensitive to economic insecurity than marriage.\n\n\u2022 The study's findings suggest that employment effects on union formation are more than just a matter of financial resources, supporting Oppenheimer's career uncertainty hypothesis. The study also found that income effects explain about half of the effects of employment and work experience.\n\n\u2022 The study's results indicate that men's economic position matters more for marriage in more traditional societies. The study also found that the effects of men's employment and school enrollment on union formation are stronger in more traditional societies than in more egalitarian ones.\n\n\u2022 The study's findings have implications for understanding the role of women in marriage and cohabitation, suggesting that women's economic position and career stability may also play a crucial role in determining union formation. The study highlights the need for more research on the interplay between men's and women's economic characteristics in shaping demographic trends.\n\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 2, "n_sentences_total": 14, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

The enhanced bone fragility reflects the integration of bone mass and bone quality. Bone quality depends on its macro- and microarchitecture and on the intrinsic properties of the materials that comprise it.*\n* *Bone is continually adapting to changes in its mechanical and hormonal environment via the process of bone remodeling. Bone remodeling maintains bone structure and its mechanical competence by removing damaged bone and replacing it with new bone. This process depends on the normal production, work, and lifespan of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes.*\n* *Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease affecting the myelin sheath covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, leading to functional impairments such as visual impairment, abnormal walking mechanics, poor balance, muscle weakness, fatigue, and progressive immobilization.*\n* *Impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing physical activity reduces mechanical stress on bone, causing a marked imbalance in bone remodeling with a disruption of osteocytes network. Management of MS requires long-term disease-modifying therapy, such as glucocorticoids (GCS), which has a further negative effect on bone remodeling and bone strength.*\n* *Secondary osteoporosis may develop in patients with MS, and low-trauma fractures occur more frequently than in healthy controls. Fractures and their sequelae can have important personal and economic implications for society, making attention to bone health among patients with MS warranted.*\n* *The analysis of a registry of 9029 patients with MS found that 27.2% reported low bone mass, and more than 15% reported a history of fracture.

Kirsty Williams AM stated that the use of these powers was mixed, with some local authorities using them regularly and others not at all. She provided examples of successful interventions, including in Flintshire and Torfaen. The Minister emphasized that local authorities should be the first port of call for intervention and encouraged them to take a proactive approach.\n\n\u2022 The committee also discussed the national evaluation and improvement resource, which was developed in conjunction with the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners. Kirsty Williams AM explained that the resource aimed to provide a more robust approach to self-evaluation and would be introduced across the system in September 2020. The Minister emphasized the importance of developing the skills within the system to have robust self-evaluation. Steve Davies added that Estyn had played a critical role in the development of the resource.\n\n\u2022 The committee then turned to the issue of schools causing concern, with Kirsty Williams AM acknowledging that the chief inspector's conclusion that these schools were not being identified early enough was correct. The Minister explained that the categorisation system had led to a greater understanding of schools, but not necessarily to more rapid improvement. She outlined a new multi-agency approach to support schools that were causing concern, which included the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn, and Welsh Government. The approach aimed to provide earlier support and more sustainable improvement.\n\n\u2022 The committee also discussed the work of the consortia, with Kirsty Williams AM stating that while some regional consortia services had performed highly, others needed to improve. The Minister emphasized the importance of scale in school improvement services and the value of regional working.

The committee is inquiring into the use of powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 and the effectiveness of the national evaluation and improvement resource. The Minister explains that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is still involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey.\n* The OECD has conducted a rapid review of the state of Welsh education and will publish its latest report on Welsh education in March. The Minister intends to make a statement to the Chamber on 24 March. The OECD's review is part of the Welsh Government's ongoing development of self-evaluation. \n* The Minister explains that the OECD's review is not just about accountability but also about self-evaluation of the Welsh Government and the system as a whole. The OECD's review is an external verification of where the Welsh Government is, and it is a risk for Ministers and the Government to accept an honest evaluation. \n* The Minister discusses the use of powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013, which allows local authorities to intervene in schools if necessary. The Minister notes that there is a mixed picture, with some local authorities using these powers regularly and others not using them at all. \n* The Minister explains that the national evaluation and improvement resource is a new approach to self-evaluation, which is being developed in conjunction with the OECD, middle tier, and practitioners.
