1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, specifically ratchet systems, are not well understood, and their behavior is sensitive to initial conditions and system parameters.

2. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport, and their behavior is of interest due to potential applications in extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations.

3. Recent studies have focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, and the behavior of these systems is characterized by complex phase-space structures, including stability islands and chaotic seas.

4. The transport properties of these systems can change dramatically as parameters change, and the behavior of individual trajectories can be very different from that of many trajectories.

5. The current for an ensemble in the system is defined as the time-average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions, and it depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.

6. The convergence of the current as a function of the number of particles in the ensemble is not always rapid, and the current can be sensitive to the location and spread of the initial ensemble.

7. The heuristic that bifurcations in single-trajectory behavior often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system is supported by the results, but not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation, nor vice versa.

8. The open question is to figure out if the reason for when these rules are violated or are valid can be made more concrete, and further studies are needed to understand the behavior of chaotic deterministic ratchets.

1. The study analyzed six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems, including HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B, to search for additional planets using high-precision radial velocity measurements and dynamical simulations.

2. The researchers used test particle simulations to determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits, and found that there are regions detectable by current surveys where additional objects can exist, particularly in the HD 3651 and HD 37605 systems.

3. The study combined the simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and found that additional short-period planets can be ruled out down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions in the HD 3651 and HD 45350 systems.

4. The researchers found that the three systems with the best limits (HD 3651, HD 45350, and 16 Cyg B) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions, while the remaining three systems had a higher rms scatter, making it challenging to determine useful companion limits.

5. The study concluded that there is no evidence for additional planets in the six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems studied, and that the combination of high-precision radial velocity measurements and dynamical simulations is a powerful tool for searching for additional planets in these systems.

1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the @xmath1-boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the @xmath1-decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousands.

2. The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the @xmath1-pole.

3. The next generation @xmath1 factory, which can be realized in the Gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ILC), is expected to generate several orders of magnitude higher @xmath1 events than the LEP.

4. The rare @xmath1-decays, such as the flavor-changing (FC) processes and the decay into light Higgs bosons, are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics and should be investigated comprehensively.

5. The authors extend the previous studies of these decays to some new models, including the Singlet Extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM).

6. The authors calculate the branching ratios of the rare @xmath1-decays in the type-II 2HDM, lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM, and NMSSM, and impose various constraints from experimental data, including the LEP search for neutral Higgs bosons, the Cleo-III limit on @xmath161, and the latest Babar limits on @xmath162.

7. The authors perform four independent random scans over the parameter space of the type-II 2HDM, lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM, and NMSSM, and analyze the properties of the light CP-odd Higgs boson @xmath0.

8. The authors find that the branching ratios of the rare @xmath1-decays can be as large as 5% for @xmath118, 8% for @xmath3, and 9% for @xmath4, which implies that the decays @xmath2 and @xmath283 may be accessible at the Gigaz option.

9. The authors conclude that the rare @xmath1-decays can be used to distinguish different models through the measurement of these decays, and that the decay @xmath11 may serve as an alternative channel to test new physics models.

1. The paper discusses the no-scale type boundary conditions in supersymmetry (SUSY) models, which are highly predictive and can be a solution to the SUSY flavor problem. The no-scale type boundary conditions are obtained in various types of SUSY models.

2. The authors investigate the indication of the current Higgs mass and B-physics constraint on SUSY models with the boundary condition. They consider three cases: the minimal case where universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, the case where the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, and the case where non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale.

3. In the minimal case, the authors find that the Higgs mass bound and B-physics constraint are also taken into account, then almost all the parameter region is excluded, leaving very narrow allowed region for μ > 0.

4. In the case where the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, the authors find that wide region of the parameter space is allowed. In the μ > 0 case, Tevatron has a chance to observe SUSY signatures like trilepton events, and the scale M may be explored by measuring the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the m_ℓℓ^max.

5. In the case where non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale, the authors find that the Higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino LSP case because stop masses are as light as sleptons and charginos. The mass of the higgsino-like neutralino must be larger than about 245 GeV and 370 GeV for μ > 0 and μ < 0, respectively.

6. The authors conclude that the no-scale type boundary conditions are attractive because they are highly predictive and can be a solution to the SUSY flavor problem. However, the current constraints from the Higgs mass and B-physics data are severe, and further studies are needed to explore the allowed parameter space.

1. The paper discusses the stability of quasiregular (qr) singularities in the spacetime of colliding plane waves (cpw) with cross polarization, which is a minimal extension of the Bell and Szekeres (BS) solution.

2. The stability conjecture proposed by Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) states that if certain scalars diverge in a maximally extended spacetime with a Cauchy horizon (CH), then the CH will be unstable and convert into a scalar curvature singularity (SCS).

3. The paper applies the HK stability conjecture to test the stability of qr singularities in the incoming region of the cross-polarized version of the BS spacetime (CPBS).

4. The analysis of geodesics shows that more geodesics remain in region II (the incoming region) relative to the parallel polarization case, indicating that the cross polarization has a pushing-out effect.

5. The paper also considers a test electromagnetic (EM) field and finds that the qr singularity is unstable and transforms into a non-scalar curvature singularity (NCS).

6. However, the exact back-reaction solution shows that the qr singularity is not transformed into an NCS, but rather remains a qr singularity.

7. The paper then considers a test scalar field and finds that the qr singularity is unstable and transforms into a SCS, which is in agreement with the HK stability conjecture.

8. Finally, the paper introduces test null dusts into the interaction region of the CPBS spacetime and finds that the CH is unstable and transforms into a SCS, which is also in agreement with the HK stability conjecture.

1. The authors have conducted a study on the x-ray properties of normal galaxies at cosmologically interesting distances using the Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N) survey data. They have detected significant numbers of normal galaxies among the population of x-ray sources making the diffuse x-ray background (XRB), with these galaxies contributing as much as 51% of the XRB flux in the 0.52 keV band.

2. The study has focused on galaxies with redshifts between 0.25 and 1.0, using both spectroscopic and photometric redshift catalogs. The authors have constructed a sample of galaxies similar to spiral galaxies in the local universe, using morphological classes and spectral energy distribution (SED) classifications to filter the sources.

3. The authors have used stacking analysis to estimate the x-ray emission from the average galaxy in each redshift bin, with significant detections in the soft band for all redshift bins up to z=0.8. They have also plotted the x-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio (Lx/LB) versus redshift, finding a slight increase (factor of 1.6) in the average Lx/LB from the local universe to z=0.8.

4. The study has found that the average x-ray luminosity of galaxies has not evolved upward by more than a factor of 2.3 by z=1.0, regardless of exclusion or inclusion of x-ray detected objects. The authors have also identified 85% of the soft XRB as arising from spiral galaxies not yet individually detected in deep surveys, many of which should be detectable with future Chandra observations.

1. The paper discusses the concept of quantum steering, which is a phenomenon where one party can manipulate the state of a shared quantum system without physically touching it, and the other party can verify this manipulation through local measurements.

2. The paper focuses on the case of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals, known as t-states, and investigates the epr-steerability of these states.

3. Epr-steerability is a special case of quantum steering where one party can steer the state of the other party's qubit by measuring their own qubit, and the other party can verify this steering through local measurements.

4. The paper develops a deterministic local hidden variable (LHV) model for projective measurements on t-states, which describes the steering scenario where Alice's measurement collapses Bob's state to a corresponding point on the surface of the quantum steering ellipsoid.

5. The paper also derives two sufficient conditions for t-states to be epr-steerable, which are examples of epr-steering inequalities that must be satisfied by any LHV model for Bob.

6. The first condition is based on a new epr-steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix, and the second condition is based on a known nonlinear epr-steering inequality.

7. The paper conjectures that the necessary condition for epr-steerability, which is defined by the surface of the quantum steering ellipsoid, is also sufficient for epr-steerability.

8. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the results and the potential directions for future research, including the extension of the LHV model to arbitrary two-qubit states and the generalization of the steering ellipsoid to arbitrary POVM measurements.

1. The concept of using a single electron's spin polarization to encode a binary bit of information has not been conclusively attributed to a specific individual, with Richard Feynman possibly mentioning it in casual conversations in the 1980s.

2. Encoding information in spin may have advantages, including lower power dissipation in switching logic gates, immunity to stray electric fields, and potentially faster operation.

3. A proposed scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field involves encoding logic 1 in the upspin state and using exchange interaction to enforce anti-ferromagnetic ordering.

4. However, this scheme has a severe shortcoming that prevents its use in pipelined architectures, as exchange interaction is bidirectional and cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals.

5. To overcome this issue, a three-phase clocking scheme was proposed, where two adjacent barriers are lowered pairwise at the same time to propagate the input state through a linear array.

6. However, this solution is not attractive due to the need for fabricating gate pads between every two cells, which is a major lithography challenge.

7. Reversible logic gates that are not constrained by the Landauer barrier are a more promising approach, and a logically and physically reversible quantum inverter using two exchange coupled spins was devised in 1996.

8. Using single electron or nuclear spin to encode a qubit and then utilizing this to realize a universal quantum gate has become a popular idea, motivated by the realization that spin coherence times in solids are much larger than charge coherence times.

9. All-optical quantum computing using spin to carry out quantum computing has also appeared as a viable and intriguing idea, with the advantage of not requiring electrical readout of single electron spins.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries consisting of a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary, with the secondary filling its Roche lobe and transferring mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point.

2. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off, which is characterized by a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.

3. The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of values in the CV population, including the effect of a consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) mechanism.

4. The authors calculate the long-term evolution of CVs as they approach and evolve beyond the period minimum, using a stellar code adapted to CVs, and find that the minimum period increases with increasing CAML efficiency to a maximum of around 70 minutes.

5. The authors test the calculated model parent distributions against the observed CV period distribution using a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and find that none of the synthesized model populations fits as well as the distribution which is simply flat in orbital period.

6. The authors conclude that the period minimum problem and the period spike problem remain an open issue, and that it is possible to construct CV model populations where the period spike is washed out sufficiently so that it cannot be ruled out unambiguously on the basis of an objective statistical test against the observed CV period distribution.

1. The Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of galaxies that has undergone a complex sequence of interactions and harassment, resulting in a highly disturbed intragroup medium (IGM) and a large-scale intergalactic shock wave. The collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318B, with the IGM is believed to be responsible for the shock-heating of the X-ray emitting gas.

2. The SQ system has produced a large amount of warm molecular hydrogen (H2) emission, which is detected in the mid-infrared (MIR) and is found to be widespread along the shock ridge. The H2 emission is also detected in the ""bridge"" structure, which is a faint feature that connects the main shock to NGC 7319.

3. The H2 emission is found to be dominated by the 0-0 s(0) and s(1) lines, which are sensitive to the ""coolest"" warm H2. The distribution of the H2 emission varies along the shock, with the brightest emission concentrated towards the north of the shock. The H2 emission is also found to be clumpy, with the clumps being more pronounced in the ""bridge"" structure.

4. The SQ system is found to have a complex distribution of fine-structure lines, including [Fe II], [O IV], [Si III], [Ne II], and [Ne III]. The [Fe II] emission is found to be faint and is likely to be produced by shocks. The [Si III] emission is found to be strong and is likely to be produced by the cooling of X-ray-irradiated gas.

5. The SQ system is found to have a low star formation rate (SFR) in the regions dominated by warm H2 emission, suggesting that the H2 is significantly reheated and cool clouds are too short-lived or undersized to collapse. The SFR is found to be dominated by the extragalactic star-forming region, SQ-A, and the region 7318B-South, which are located at the extreme ends of the shock ridge.

1. The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, as evidenced by the CAI-rich inclusions found in primitive chondritic meteorites.

2. The SLRI may have been injected into the solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave, which would have introduced spatial heterogeneity and reduced the usefulness of @xmath4al as a chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation.

3. Previous models have shown that initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk through large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles.

4. The stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation, with small refractory particles from comet 81p/Wild 2 showing a range of @xmath0 6% variations in @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios.

5. The leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, which could lead to isotopic fractionation between gas-phase and solid-phase oxygen atoms.

6. The existence of refractory particles in comet 81p/Wild 2, which are thought to have formed close to the protosun, implies that these small particles experienced large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula.

7. MGU disks offer a means to accomplish this early large-scale transport, and are likely to be involved in the FU Orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars.

8. The numerical models presented in this paper examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula, by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection process, for a variety of disk and central protostar masses.

9. The results of the models show that a phase of marginal gravitational instability in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains, as required to drive the protostellar mass accretion associated with FU Orionis events, as well as to explain the discovery of refractory grains in comet 81p/Wild 2.

2. They combined dijet mass spectra from four triggers in run 1a and 1b, with integrated luminosities of 7.5 pb, 1.92 pb, 9.52 pb, and 69.8 pb, respectively.

3. The authors used a fixed cone clustering algorithm (r=0.7) to define jets and corrected for detector response, energy lost outside the cone, and underlying event.

4. They took the two highest jets and required that they have pseudorapidity and a CMS scattering angle less than 2/3, which provides uniform acceptance as a function of mass and reduces the QCD background.

5. The authors determined the QCD background by fitting the data to a smooth function of three parameters and noted upward fluctuations near 200 GeV/c, 550 GeV/c, and 850 GeV/c.

6. They searched for narrow resonances by performing a binned maximum likelihood fit of the data to the background parameterization and the mass resonance shape, and found a 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section for new particles.

7. The authors also searched for topgluons in the b-tagged dijet channel, which is the most sensitive channel due to the larger coupling to the third generation.

8. They set limits on new particle production, excluding topgluons of width 0.2 in the mass region 550-600 GeV/c, and found upward fluctuations in all three channels, which may be the first signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

1. The observational evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe was first obtained from supernovae type Ia (SNIa) observations, which found them to be fainter than expected. This has been confirmed by various independent observations, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in matter distribution, and others.

2. The accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy (DE). The nature of this unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort to understand its properties. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of the DE driving the present epoch of accelerated expansion.

3. The current cosmological model is described by the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, which is valid for a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The model is commonly known as the Lambda-CDM model, indicating the nature of its main components. However, this model is not satisfactory from the theoretical point of view, as the value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than what it was estimated in particle physics.

4. The interaction between dark matter (DM) and DE has been proposed to alleviate the coincidence problem, which demands a fine-tuning on the initial conditions at the Planck scale of 90 orders of magnitude. The interaction between DM and DE can be constrained with observations of the background evolution and the emergence of large-scale structure. Current and future observations could and will be used to set up constraints on interactions between dark sectors and clarify the nature of DM/DE interactions.

1. The study of Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) spectra reveals a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines, providing insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas near the central massive object.

2. Broad emission lines, such as Hα, are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole, with some systematics emerging in the form of two Type 1 AGN populations.

3. Population A sources show the smallest broad-line widths (FWHM Hα = 1000-4000) and include Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) sources, while Population B sources show broader lines (FWHM Hα = 4000-12000) and require two Gaussians for a reasonable profile description.

4. The study of Fe II emission in Type 1 quasars reveals that it arises in or near the emitting clouds that produce other low-ionization lines, with FWHM Fe II correlating with FWHM Hα over the full range where Fe II can be detected.

5. A systematic redshift of Fe II relative to [O III] 5007 and Hα has been claimed by some studies, but this result is disputed by the authors, who argue that the accuracy of Fe II shift measures depends on Fe II strength, Fe II/Hα profile widths, spectral S/N, and the strength of He II 4686 emission.

6. The authors generate high S/N composite spectra using the 4DE1 formalism and find no evidence for a systematic Fe II redshift in their sample of bright quasars, with the best-fit solutions indicating zero or near-zero shifts.

7. The authors suggest that the previous claims of large Fe II redshifts may have been driven by the exclusion of He II 4686 from the fits, which can produce a ""redshift"" of the blue Fe II blend, and that small systematic shifts of Fe II with respect to the rest frame are plausible but require high S/N spectra for reliable analysis.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 7}

1. Nuclear multifragmentation is a phenomenon where atomic nuclei break apart into smaller fragments, and it is being studied both theoretically and experimentally due to its similarities with the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.

2. The caloric curve, which represents the temperature of the system as a function of excitation energy, has been measured in experiments, and a wide plateau-like region was identified, suggesting a possible liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter.

3. However, subsequent experiments using different reactions obtained slightly different caloric curves, and the plateau-like region was absent in most cases, leading to discrepancies that may be due to experimental precision and finite-size effects.

4. Recent reevaluations of the Aladin group's data on neutron kinetic energies brought corrections of about 10^-6, and it was proven that the energies of spectator parts grow with approximately 30^-6 in the bombarding energy interval 600 to 1000 MeV/nucleon.

5. The microcanonical multifragmentation model has been improved by refining the primary break-up part and including the secondary particle emission, and the new version of the model has been used to reevaluate the caloric curve and heat capacity curves.

The primary energy source for this heating is believed to lie in the convection zone below the solar photosphere, where there is 100 times as much energy available than that required to heat the corona.

2. The debate centers on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from the dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events giving rise to nanoflares. Theoretical studies suggest that only high-frequency MHD waves are capable of significant heating.

The setup includes a special opto-mechanical interface between the coronagraph and the SECIS instrument, which consists of two fast-frame-rate CCD cameras and auxiliary electronics systems.

2. Other H3O+ lines have been detected from ground or airborne-based telescopes, including the 3.1-2.2 transition at 183 GHz, the 4.1-3.2 transition at 380 GHz, the 10.1-9.2 transition at 321 GHz, and the 5.1-4.2 transition at 325 GHz.

3. The 3.1-2.2 transition at 183 GHz has been used to map the emission of H3O+ at very large spatial scales, including a map of the Orion molecular cloud that is 6 orders of magnitude larger than the size of the spots detected at 22 GHz.

4. The ISO satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, and mapping of the SGRB2 molecular cloud has shown that water vapor is an ubiquitous molecule in molecular clouds with an abundance of 10^-7.

5. Ground-based observations of the 325 GHz line of H3O+ have been performed using the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and the data show that the H3O+ abundance is 4 x 10^-5 in the plateau region of the Orion molecular cloud.

6. The observations at 325 GHz have provided much finer spatial resolution than ISO or SWAS, and an estimate of the H3O+ abundance as accurate as that obtained from the extremely optically thick H3O+ lines observed in the submillimeter and far-infrared domains.

1. Threshold nets are a type of graph that can be constructed from a sequence of letters and fixed rules of connectivity, and they have been extensively studied in graph-theoretical literature. They can be produced of almost arbitrary degree distributions, including scale-free, by judiciously choosing the weight distribution and the threshold.

2. Threshold nets have several desirable properties, including modularity, easily computable structural measures, and a high degree of compressibility. However, they are limited in some obvious ways, such as having a diameter of 1 or 2, regardless of the number of nodes.

3. To overcome these limitations, a broader class of nets called sequence nets was introduced, which can be constructed from a sequence of letters and deterministic rules of connectivity. Sequence nets retain many of the desirable properties of threshold nets, including modularity and easily computable structural measures.

4. The authors systematically explored all possible rules for creating connected sequence nets from a two-letter alphabet and found that threshold nets are only one of three equivalence classes, characterized by the highest level of symmetry. They also discussed the remaining two classes, showing that they have a high degree of modularity and various structural properties can be computed easily.

5. For three-letter sequence nets, the authors derived all possible forms of connected three-letter sequence nets and found 30 distinct equivalence classes. Among these classes, they identified a natural extension of threshold nets to three-letter sequence nets.

6. The authors also showed that some three-letter sequence nets can be mapped into threshold nets with two thresholds, instead of one. They concluded with a summary and discussion of open problems in the field.

7. The study of sequence nets has several potential applications, including modeling social networks, where the weights might measure political leaning, economical status, number of offspring, etc., and agents tend to associate when they are closer in these measures.

1. The paper introduces the concept of subordinators in nonconvex penalization problems, which leads to a Bayesian approach for constructing sparsity-inducing pseudo-priors. Two compound Poisson subordinators, the compound Poisson gamma subordinator and the negative binomial subordinator, are studied, and their limiting behaviors are established.

2. The paper develops the Expectation-Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm for solving sparse learning problems based on the nonconvex log, exp, linear-fractional (LFR), and compound exponential-log (CEL) penalties. The ECME algorithm is used to learn about the local regularization parameters and the latent shrinkage parameters simultaneously.

3. The paper conducts experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art approach and shows that the nonconvex penalization approach is potentially useful in high-dimensional Bayesian modeling. The results also demonstrate that the improper priors induced from the LFR, CEL, and exp penalties work well, even better than the proper case.

2. Researchers have proposed that the nonlinear current response can be used to examine the order parameter symmetry, and one prediction is that an anisotropy should exist in the nonlinear current as a function of the direction of the superfluid velocity relative to the position of the node.

3. The study of one-band superconductors has shown that the nonlinear current response is a small effect on the plots, but it will be borne out in the paper that the nonlinear current does not show significant differences in the temperature dependence between 2D and 3D.

4. The study of two-band superconductors has shown that the nonlinear coefficient can be increased by the presence of the second band, and the feature characteristic of the lower-energy scale of the second band will appear in the nonlinear coefficients, but with increased interband coupling or interband scattering, such a signature will rapidly disappear.

5. The study of the specific case of MGB0 has shown that the nonlinear coefficient is monotonically increasing, and the increased nonlinearity due to the second band is best reduced by adding impurities to the second band.

20,"1. The authors propose a new efficient time series classification algorithm based on 1-nearest neighbor classification using the dynamic time warping distance with multi Ratanamahatana-Keogh (R-K) bands as a global constraint. To select the best R-K band, they use two proposed learning algorithms: band boundary extraction and iterative learning, with the silhouette index as a heuristic function for selecting the band that yields the best prediction accuracy.

2. The proposed algorithm uses the LB_Keogh lower bound to speed up the computation in the data prediction step, and it has been shown that the classification accuracy depends solely on the size of the global constraint, which should be determined based on the properties of the data at hand.",1,{'n_points': 2}

1. The Standard Model of elementary particles (SM) has been successful in describing the nature at the electroweak (EW) scale, but recent discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have led to the consideration of new physics beyond the SM.

2. The LHC has discovered a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson, which strengthens the correctness of the SM. However, no explicit evidence of physics beyond the SM has been reported from the LHC.

3. An anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) has been observed, which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions. The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than 10σ.

4. The muon g-2 anomaly is considered a hint of new physics, and the possibility of a new gauge interaction beyond the SM is explored. The authors propose a new gauge interaction that could explain the anomaly.

5. The authors discuss the constraints on the parameters of the new gauge interaction, which must be consistent with the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. They consider two possibilities: (1) the new gauge interaction is inefficient, and (2) the majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos are small.

6. The authors calculate the bound on the new gauge interaction parameter, which must be smaller than the Hubble scale for the washout of the baryon asymmetry not to occur. They also discuss the decay of the right-handed neutrinos and their impact on the universe.

7. The authors conclude that the new gauge interaction could provide a solution to the muon g-2 anomaly and the baryon asymmetry problem, but further experimental and theoretical work is needed to confirm this possibility.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is a unique property that plays an important role in quantum information processing, and its study has attracted much attention in recent years.

2. The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed experimentally, where the entanglement of qubits under Markovian decoherence can be terminated in a finite time.

3. However, some studies have indicated that ESD is not always the eventual fate of qubit entanglement, and entanglement can revive again after some time.

4. Researchers have asked the question of where the lost entanglement of qubits goes, and found that it is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics.

5. A similar situation happens for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom for one of the two particles interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.

6. The study of entanglement dynamics in a double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model has shown that the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system.

7. In this paper, the authors show that the identity about the entanglement in the whole system is still valid in the presence of decoherence, which is a non-equilibrium relaxation process.

8. The authors find that the distribution of the entanglement among the bipartite subsystems is dependent on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.

9. The authors also find that the entanglement can be stably distributed among all the bipartite subsystems if the qubit and its reservoir can form a bound state and the non-Markovian effect is important.

10. The study of entanglement distribution in a photonic band gap (PBG) medium has shown that the initial entanglement in one bipartite partition can be transferred to another bipartite partition, and a stable entanglement can even be formed for the non-interacting bipartite system.

1. Researchers have been studying the correlation between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational waves (GWs) to understand the origin of GRBs. They used a cross-correlation method to analyze the data from two GW detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, and found that the presence of signals of amplitude above a certain value is excluded with 95% probability. The result is given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound, which is considered the most complete and unbiased way of providing the experimental information.

2. The researchers also discussed the Bayesian approach to infer the GW amplitude from the observed data. They used Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability density function of the GW amplitude and obtained an expected value and standard deviation for the amplitude. They also provided an upper limit for the amplitude, defined as the value below which there is a given probability for the amplitude to be located. The result is given in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound, which can be used to combine results from independent datasets.

They also mention that the number of citations can be an estimate measure of a paper's scientific credibility, although it should not be taken too literally.

2. The authors analyze the citation distribution of scientific publications, which follows a power-law form with an exponent. They identify this behavior as a consequence of highly cited papers being more likely to acquire further citations, known as a preferential attachment process.

3. The authors propose a simple model to investigate the growth of two coupled networks, representing different research areas, and referencing within and across each other. They define a rate equation to describe the time evolution of the network and derive a recurrence relation to obtain the total in-degree distribution.

4. The authors find that the total in-degree distribution follows a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. They also derive the distributions of average number of nodes with intra-links, cross-links, and incoming cross-links, and find that they follow power-law forms with exponents that depend on the coupling parameters.

1. The traditional two-step process for hadron production at large transverse momentum involves a hard scattering of partons followed by the fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. However, this process is inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions.

2. In heavy-ion collisions, the recombination of partons is shown to be a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved. At extremely high transverse momentum, fragmentation is still dominant.

3. To achieve a universal description of hadronization that can be applied to any transverse momentum, it is necessary to treat the fragmentation process as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet.

4. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.

5. The shower parton distributions (spd) are determined phenomenologically, and their properties are illustrated in the context of heavy-ion collisions. The spd are shown to be crucial when shower partons recombine with other partons that are not in the jet but are in the ambient environment.

6. The recombination model is used to describe the hadronization process, and the shower parton distributions are obtained by solving integral equations that relate the fragmentation functions to the shower parton distributions.

7. The shower parton distributions are used to study the production of particles in heavy-ion collisions, and it is shown that the thermal-shower recombination is more important than fragmentation in the range of transverse momentum shown.

8. The shower parton distributions are also used to study the dihadron distribution in a jet, and it is shown that the two-particle distribution can not be adequately represented by the fragmentation functions alone.

2. They focus on the Dirac-Kähler formulation, which uses the antisymmetry of differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra, and aim to develop a discrete differential geometry scheme that preserves the properties of the continuum.

3. The authors review previous attempts to discretize the Dirac-Kähler equation, including the use of lattices and non-commutative differential forms, but note that these approaches have limitations.

4. They propose a new approach based on the work of Adams, which involves using two parallel lattices to maintain locality and a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product.

5. The authors discuss the application of this approach to the Dirac-Kähler formulation and show how it can be used to describe chiral symmetry and flavour projection.

6. They introduce a new complex, the barycentric subdivided complex, which is used to define the inner product of discrete fields.

7. The authors discuss the implementation of the Clifford algebra and the correspondence between the Dirac spinor and the Dirac-Kähler field.

8. They show that the properties of the Dirac-Kähler field are only approximately captured on the complex, which prevents the use of discrete counterparts to facilitate flavour projection and exact chiral symmetry.

9. To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce a new de Rham map that uses domains of integration on the dual complex that match simplices from the original complex.

3. The paper proposes a collaborative relay beamforming scheme to maximize the secrecy rate in a cognitive radio network with multiple relays, where the relays work synchronously to perform beamforming by multiplying the signals to be transmitted with complex weights.

4. The optimization problem is formulated as a semidefinite programming problem, and two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are proposed to simplify the computation. Numerical results show that the sub-optimal schemes achieve near-optimal performance under both total and individual power constraints.

1. The source document discusses the quantization of the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS) while maintaining the @xmath0-invariance, which was discovered by Cunningham and Bateman a century ago. This invariance is broken in the usual Lorenz gauge, but its breaking may lack physical meaning.

2. The document explains that a classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFS locally, so it is reasonable to maintain the @xmath0-invariance during the quantization process in a CFS. This approach allows a free field living in a CFS to behave like in a flat space, and the corresponding Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts.

3. The document uses Dirac's six-cone formalism to realize all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. It also introduces auxiliary fields and the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to deal with gauge freedom of the Maxwell field.

4. The main result of the document is a set of Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields in an arbitrary CFS. The document also explains how to obtain the @xmath0-invariant Maxwell field in a CFS from a six-dimensional one-form.

5. The document shows how to transport Minkowskian @xmath0-invariant equations to get @xmath0-invariant equations in the CFS space. It also explains how to apply the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to the Maxwell field in the CFS space.

6. The document concludes by discussing the benefits of maintaining the @xmath0-invariance during the quantization process in a CFS. It also mentions that the classical and quantum structures of the free Maxwell field are locally the same in all CFS, and that the remaining question is to know if this is true for other free fields and how to deal with @xmath0-invariant interactions.

1. The parallel chip-firing game is a periodic automaton on graphs where vertices fire chips to their neighbors if possible. The game is governed by rules where at each move, a vertex fires exactly one chip to each neighbor if it has at least as many chips as it has neighbors.

2. The period of a position in the game is the minimal number of steps after which the position repeats. The authors have established some lemmas about parallel chip-firing games on general simple connected graphs, including bounding the number of chips on any single vertex in games with nontrivial period and defining the notion of a complement position.

3. The authors have also found that the only possible periods for the complete bipartite graph are of length 2^n-1 or 2^n for n >= 2, and have constructed games with such periods. They have also characterized all possible periods for the complete bipartite graph, showing that all periods 2^n-1 and 2^n for n >= 2 are achievable.

4. The authors have also considered the parallel chip-firing game on the complete 2-partite graph formed by joining the anticliques, and have shown that all periods from 2^k to 2^(k+1) are achievable for k >= 1. They have also proposed several directions for further research, including bounding the periods of positions on vertex-regular graphs and more general bipartite graphs.

2. The analysis is guided by a theoretical approach, specifically the synchrotron/self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) and traditional afterglow models, which have been applied to different types of sources, including GRBs.

3. The authors note that GRBs can be subdivided into various classes and subclasses, each with specific progenitors and astrophysical processes, and that a new paradigm has been introduced to explain the role of binary sources in the long GRB-supernova connection.

4. The study focuses on GRB 090510, a short GRB that has been interpreted as a binary neutron star (NS) merger, and performs a new time-resolved spectral analysis to identify a precise sequence of events.

5. The analysis reveals a new structure in the thermal emission of the prompt gamma-ray burst (p-GRB) emission, followed by the onset of GeV emission linked to the black hole (BH) formation, and allows the derivation of the structure of the circumburst medium from the spiky structure of the prompt emission.

6. The study provides evidence for the formation of a Kerr-Newman BH in GRB 090510 from the merger of two massive NSs in a binary system, and estimates the energy requirement for the GeV emission, which is fulfilled by the accretion of crustal material from the NS binary progenitor.

7. The analysis also reveals that the GeV emission is jetted, with geometrical beaming angles inferred for co-rotating and counter-rotating orbits around an extreme Kerr BH, and that the energetic and possible beaming of the GeV emission requires the presence of a Kerr BH or a Kerr-Newman BH.

8. The study concludes that the dyadotorus manifests itself by the p-GRB emission and clearly precedes the prompt emission phase, as well as the GeV emission originating from the newly-formed BH, and that this sequence illustrates the formation process of a BH for the first time.

2. The SM predicts the mass of the W boson in terms of other parameters of the theory, which is strongly correlated with the experimentally measured value of the top quark mass. This correlation can be used to limit the allowed region for the Higgs boson mass.

3. In models with new physics, the SM tree-level relation no longer holds, and when the theory is renormalized at one loop, models of this type will require extra input parameters. Phenomenological studies have considered the contributions of the SM at one-loop, plus the tree-level contributions of new physics.

4. The triplet model, which includes a real scalar triplet, has been considered as an example of a model with new physics. In this model, the dependence of the W boson mass on the top quark mass is logarithmic, while the dependence on the scalar masses is quadratic.

5. The non-decoupling property of the triplet is observed in the model, which means that the one-loop electroweak results cannot be split into a SM contribution plus a piece that vanishes as the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the weak scale. This fact has been overlooked in previous analyses of the littlest Higgs model.

6. The left-right symmetric model has also been considered as an example of a model with new physics, which includes a scalar bi-doublet and two triplets. In this model, the counterterm for the weak mixing angle is defined through the parameters and their counterterms, and the non-decoupling effect is also observed.

2. Log-Riemann surfaces of finite type are certain branched coverings, in a generalized sense, of the Riemann sphere by a punctured compact Riemann surface, given by certain transcendental functions of infinite degree.

3. A log-Riemann surface consists of a Riemann surface together with a local holomorphic diffeomorphism from the surface to the Riemann sphere, such that the set of points added to the surface is discrete.

4. Log-Riemann surfaces were defined and studied in previous works, where it was shown that the map restricted to a small enough punctured metric neighborhood of a point gives a covering of a punctured disc in the Riemann sphere.

5. A log-Riemann surface is said to be of finite type if it has finitely many ramification points and a finitely generated fundamental group.

6. Uniformization theorems were proved for log-Riemann surfaces of finite type, which imply that a log-Riemann surface of finite type is given by a pair, where the first component is a compact Riemann surface, and the second component is a meromorphic function on the punctured surface with exponential singularities.

7. An exp-algebraic curve is an equivalence class of log-Riemann surface structures of finite type, given by the data of a punctured compact Riemann surface and equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions with poles at the punctures.

8. The data of an exp-algebraic curve defines a degree-zero line bundle together with a transcendental section of this line bundle, which is non-zero on the punctured surface.

9. The correspondence between exp-algebraic structures on a compact Riemann surface and degree-zero line bundles on the surface with meromorphic connections gives a one-to-one correspondence between exp-algebraic structures and degree-zero line bundles with certain properties.

10. The main theorem states that two exp-algebraic curves with the same underlying Riemann surface and the same set of punctures are isomorphic if and only if the line bundles associated to the curves are isomorphic and the induced isomorphism maps the spaces of meromorphic sections to each other.

2. They mention that merging DMFT with realistic LDA based electronic structure calculations is promising due to its simplicity and correctness in both band and atomic limits, and that much effort is being made in this direction.

3. The authors propose an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation, which is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem, but rather a follow-up of the ideology of LDA theory.

4. They use a rational representation to achieve a fast interpolative algorithm for the self-energy, and the coefficients in this interpolation can be found by forcing the self-energy to obey several limits and constraints.

5. The authors test two commonly used methods, the slave boson mean field (SBMF) method and the Hubbard I approximation, to determine the functional dependence of the coefficients upon doping, degeneracy, and the strength of the interaction.

6. They compare the results of these methods against more accurate but computationally demanding quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations and establish the procedure to extract all necessary parameters.

7. The authors find that the SBMF method gives a good agreement with the QMC data for the average number of electrons, quasiparticle residue, and density-density correlation function, but overestimates the mass renormalization.

The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in complex systems, such as the surface reaction model proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad (ZGB), has been a topic of growing interest due to its applications in various fields. The ZGB model describes the kinetic aspects of the oxidation of a catalytic surface and has been studied using different methods, including mean-field theory, simulations, and Monte Carlo simulations.

2. The introduction of inert sites on the catalytic surface in the ZGB model has been shown to affect the phase transitions observed in the system. The pair approximation and Monte Carlo simulations have been used to study the effects of inert sites on the phase diagram of the ZGB model, and the results have been compared to those obtained using the site approximation.

3. The critical concentration of inert sites at which the transition between the reactive and co-poisoned phases changes from first-order to continuous has been determined using Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the transition is first-order for values of the concentration of inert sites less than the critical value, and changes to a continuous one above this value. The production rate of CO2 molecules is maximum at the first-order transition, and the overall effect of inert sites is to reduce the production of CO2 molecules.

They motivate the study by citing the scaling limit of interacting particle systems, which has its origins in statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics.

3. The trace of the second fundamental form of such maps vanishes, and the energy density of a smooth map is defined by a specific formula involving the volume measure and the second fundamental form.

4. The second fundamental form of a smooth map is a symmetric map defined by a specific formula involving the Levi-Civita connections and the pullback metric.

5. The tension field of a smooth map is defined as a section of the tangent bundle, and a map is said to be harmonic if its tension field vanishes identically.

6. The Hessian of a harmonic map is defined as a bilinear form on the tangent space, and the index of a harmonic map is defined as the dimension of the tangent subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite.

7. A harmonic map is said to be stable if its Morse index is zero and unstable otherwise, and a non-degenerate point on a harmonic map can be decomposed into its vertical and horizontal spaces.

8. A map is said to be horizontally conformal if the restriction of the second fundamental form to the horizontal space is surjective and conformal.

The sample consists of 313 AGN, including Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, and is used to study the FIR emission and its relation to the AGN luminosity.

2. The analysis reveals that the FIR emission in AGN host galaxies is likely produced by cold dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) heated by stellar radiation, similar to normal star-forming galaxies without an AGN. However, a small group of AGN shows anomalous colors, indicating that their FIR emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation from a radio jet.

3. The study also finds a correlation between the 500 μm excess emission and the 14.195 keV luminosity, as well as the 3.4/4.6 μm color from the Wise survey. This suggests that the excess emission may be related to coronal emission above the accretion disk, and future work will focus on combining photometry from this study and archival data to perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling.

They consider a minimal breaking of the A4 symmetry through a single parameter in a single element of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, keeping the same texture of the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix.

2. The authors explore all nine possible cases of breaking the A4 symmetry and find that non-zero Dirac CP violation is generated in cases where the breaking is applied to the 12, 13, 21, 31, 22, 33 elements of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix. They express all three mixing angles in terms of one model parameter and show the variation of all three mixing angles with the model parameter.

3. The authors also consider the case where one of the parameters is complex and find that the model predicts large Dirac CP violation, which is compatible with the present experimental upper bound. They also study leptogenesis in the model and find that the present WMAP value of baryon asymmetry is obtained for a right-handed neutrino mass scale of 8 GeV. The authors conclude that the phases responsible for leptogenesis are correlated, and the model predicts a large Dirac CP-violating phase, which is compatible with the present experimental upper bound.

1. The study focuses on the charge transfer energies of an organic molecule, specifically benzene, adsorbed on a graphene sheet. The researchers used Constrained Density Functional Theory (CDFT) to calculate the energy levels alignment of the molecule and the graphene sheet.

2. The CDFT approach is a more resource-efficient alternative to the GW approximation, which is highly computationally demanding. CDFT calculates the energy levels alignment by transferring one electron from the molecule to the substrate and calculating the difference in energy with respect to the locally charge-neutral configuration.

3. The researchers found that the charge transfer energies depend on the distance between the molecule and the graphene sheet, and this is a consequence of the image charge formation. The image charge is not strictly confined to a 2D plane but spills out over the graphene surface.

4. The study also investigated the effects of structural defects in the graphene sheet on the charge transfer energies. The researchers found that a stone-wales defect does not affect the energy level alignment since its electronic density of states has little amplitude at the graphene Fermi level.

The researchers used a simple classical electrostatic model to describe the interaction of a point-like charge and a uniform planar charge distribution, which takes into account the finite dielectric constant of graphene. The model agrees well with the CDFT results and can be used to rationalize the effects of the presence of other benzene molecules on the charge transfer energies.

1. The interaction between many particles can be described by determining their pair potential or the forces among a single pair, but this approach is not accurate when nonlinearities are present, leading to many-body effects.

2. Many-body effects can lead to a strengthening or weakening of the total force acting on a particle, a change of sign of that force, or the appearance of stable or unstable configurations, and can be observed in various systems such as nuclear matter, superconductivity, colloidal suspensions, and quantum-electrodynamic Casimir forces.

3. The authors study the critical Casimir forces (CCFs) acting on two colloidal particles immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture and close to a homogeneous, planar substrate, and focus on the critical concentration which implies the absence of a bulk field conjugate to the order parameter.

4. The forces are calculated using the full three-dimensional numerical analysis of the mean-field theory (MFT) as given by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian, and the authors consider two three-dimensional spheres of radii R1 and R2 with different boundary conditions (BCs) facing a homogeneous substrate with a specific BC.

5. The authors find that the scaling functions of the normal and lateral CCFs acting on colloid (2) exhibit a change of sign upon varying the temperature, and that the many-body contribution to the normal CCF is attractive for all BCs considered, regardless of the surface-to-surface distances between the spheres and the sphere-surface-to-substrate distances.

6. The authors also find that the many-body contribution to the lateral CCF is always attractive for the given geometrical configuration, regardless of the BCs, and that the relative contribution of the many-body CCF to the total force is between 10^-4 and 10^-3.

7. The authors compare their results with corresponding ones for quantum-electrodynamic Casimir interactions and find that the many-body contribution to the lateral CCF is attractive, regardless of the BCs, whereas in the case of quantum-electrodynamic Casimir interactions, the many-body force is attractive (repulsive) if the stronger one of the two normal sphere-plate forces is attractive (repulsive).

8. The authors also consider the configuration in which the two colloids are vertically aligned with respect to the substrate and calculate the many-body contribution to the normal CCF acting on colloid (1) for two spherical colloids of the same size, keeping the sphere-surface-to-s",1,{'n_points': 8}

1. Molecular hydrogen is the most abundant molecule in the universe and plays a crucial role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium, particularly in regions where stars are forming.

2. The formation of molecular hydrogen is governed by the transformation of atomic diffuse clouds into molecular clouds, and dust grains are recognized as the favored habitat for its formation.

3. The sticking of hydrogen atoms onto dust grains is an important mechanism for the formation of molecular hydrogen, and it can also be an important mechanism to cool interstellar gas.

4. Laboratory experiments and theoretical models have been developed to understand how molecular hydrogen forms, and the sticking of hydrogen atoms onto dust surfaces has been highlighted by several experiments on different types of surfaces.

5. Dust grains in the interstellar medium are mainly carbonaceous or silicate particles with various sizes, and a large part of the available surface area for chemistry is in the form of very small grains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

6. PAHs are predicted to have characteristics similar to graphite surfaces, and the first hydrogenation of neutral coronene is associated with a barrier of 360 meV, but subsequent hydrogenation barriers vanish.

7. The hydrogenation of PAH cations has been studied experimentally, and the results show that the first hydrogenation is barrierless, but subsequent hydrogenations are associated with barriers of 72 meV and 43 meV for the second and fourth hydrogenations, respectively.

8. The barriers for hydrogenation decrease with increasing hydrogenation, but do not vanish completely, and the results indicate that superhydrogenated PAH cations should also be found in the interstellar medium and be important catalysts for the formation of molecular hydrogen.

9. The study of the hydrogenation of PAH cations in the gas phase has been performed using a setup designed to study molecular ions in a radiofrequency ion trap, and the results have been used to derive the energy barriers for hydrogenation.

1. The operation of an atomic clock relies on an active oscillator in addition to the passive atoms, and its resonance is affected by factors such as radiation intensity and the construction of the clock. To address this issue, a wave function is introduced that takes into account these factors, and the SI second is defined as the resonance that would be found at absolute zero temperature.

2. The wave function used in the operation of an atomic clock can never be unconditionally known, and this unknowability has implications for the second as a unit of measurement in the International System (SI). This unknowability also carries over to digital communications and the use of a spacetime with a metric tensor in explaining clock readings.

3. The logical synchronization of clocks in a network is essential for the transmission and reception of logical symbols, and this synchronization requires a phase constraint on the channel, which is a set of pairs of readings from the clocks of two machines. The phase constraint is essential for the communication of logical symbols and is a fundamental aspect of logical synchronization.

4. The effect of spacetime curvature on the possible arrangements of channels in a network of open machines is analogous to the effect of surface curvature in Euclidean geometry on the ratios of the lengths of the edges of embedded graphs. This effect can be seen in the way that spacetime curvature affects the possible arrangements of channels in a network of five or more machines, and it has implications for the consistency of a frozen arrangement of open machines with an hypothesized spacetime.

1. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is a low-power, low-data-rate wireless personal area network (WPAN) standard that is suitable for wireless body area networks (WBANs) and other applications. It supports two modes of operation: beacon-enabled and non-beacon-enabled, and two types of topologies: star and peer-to-peer. The standard defines physical layer and MAC sub-layer, and supports three distinct frequency bands.

2. The performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard was analyzed in terms of load, delay, throughput, and end-to-end delay at varying data rates of 20, 40, and 250 kbps. The results showed that the standard performs better at higher data rates, with the best performance achieved at 250 kbps. The analysis also showed that the standard performs worse at low data rates, such as 20 kbps. The study also compared the performance of the standard with and without acknowledgement (ACK) enabled mode, and found that the standard performs better without ACK enabled mode due to reduced collision probability.

1. The MOPED (Multiple Optimised Parameter Estimation and Data Compression) algorithm is a patented method for compressing data and speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis. It becomes particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix is dependent on the parameters of the model.

2. However, MOPED has limitations, such as guaranteeing only the maintenance of the Fisher matrix at a chosen point, which can lead to problems with multimodal and degenerate distributions. In some cases, MOPED can create erroneous peaks in the likelihood that impede parameter estimation.

3. The authors of the paper demonstrate the benefits of MOPED for estimation of the CMB power spectrum and analysis of galaxy spectra, but also show that it can fail in certain scenarios, such as light transit analysis. They present a solution that still allows MOPED to provide a large speed increase.

4. The authors investigate the limitations of MOPED by considering a few test cases in the context of gravitational wave data analysis for the LISA detector. They show that MOPED can create multiple peaks in the likelihood function equal in magnitude to the true one, which can be problematic for parameter estimation.

5. The authors propose a solution to this problem by using multiple fiducial models to create multiple sets of weighting vectors, which can help to maintain the true peaks and decrease the likelihood at incorrect values. They test this solution with 20 random fiducials and find that it leaves only the true peak at the maximum likelihood value.

1. The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a puzzle in particle physics that consists of several pieces, including the vacuum energy density being the cosmological constant, various sources of vacuum energy, and large radiative corrections. The experimental value of the cosmological constant is estimated to be 2.4 x 10^-47 GeV^4, while the theoretical value is much larger, leading to a big mystery.

2. To address the CCP, the authors propose an effective description of the physics concerning the vacuum energy and suggest that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy. They assume that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively and that external gravitons can couple to gravitational corrections of vacuum energy involving internal gravitons.

3. The authors derive a relation for the evolution of dark energy, which varies logarithmically with the temperature of the universe. They also show that the logarithmically changing energy density is described by the van der Waals type equation of state, and discuss the possibility of instability in the universe dominated by dark energy.

1. Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkalies have benefited from high-precision experimental techniques, allowing for straightforward interpretation of results in terms of electromagnetic fields generated by valence electrons and nuclear moments.

2. Recent years have seen precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two-step transitions, renewing interest in improving calculations in other states where theoretical methods are yet to be tested against experimental results.

3. Two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is presented as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states, overcoming the challenges of direct absorption of the probing laser.

4. The method involves two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapor, with one laser modulated before being directed to the interaction region.

5. The non-linear interaction of the lasers burns a hole in the atomic ground state population, generating spectra with sub-Doppler peaks and trademark sidebands.

6. The technique overcomes the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser: low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at the desired wavelength.

7. The authors present two ladder systems to illustrate the main features of the technique and two different applications of the modulation, including frequency modulation of the pump laser.

8. The frequency modulation of the pump laser and good signal-to-noise ratio allow for locking the probe laser to the excited atomic resonance, making the probe laser modulation-free.

9. The method is not limited to these two cases and can be extended to other atomic levels, with the authors providing a detailed theoretical model and experimental setup to demonstrate its effectiveness.

1. The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted significant attention, with a focus on central exclusive production (CEP) processes, where the protons remain intact and the central system is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap.

2. The CEP process is constrained to be in a color singlet state, and observing any particle, such as a Standard Model Higgs boson, in the central exclusive channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers.

3. By detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately, it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products, making forward proton detectors a crucial component in this analysis.

4. The analysis focuses on the central exclusive production of the Standard Model Higgs boson and a Supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with a mass of 120 GeV, and evaluates the most important backgrounds, including central exclusive di-jet production, double pomeron exchange, and overlap events.

5. The results show that the central exclusive production of the lightest scalar Higgs boson can be observed with a significance of at least 5σ in the b-quark decay channel within 3 years of data taking at the LHC, if suitable proton tagging detectors are installed around ATLAS and CMS, and the current predictions for the CEP cross section are correct.

1. The zero-field Hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors has been studied, and it has been found that a nonzero Hall conductivity can arise from the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition. This effect is due to the broken time-reversal symmetry in the system.

2. The Hall conductivity and power dissipation have been calculated using the bound pair dynamics description, and it has been found that they can diverge in the static limit in the low-temperature phase. However, in the high-temperature phase, the contribution from free vortex motion gives finite results in the static limit.

3. The results have been compared with the free vortex contribution, and it has been found that the sign reversal and strong positive peak in the Hall conductivity are influenced by the dip-recouping shape of the transverse response function, which stems from the asymmetric angular response of pairs to the driving field. The convective term in the Fokker-Planck equation, which originates from the broken time-reversal symmetry nature of a chiral p-wave superconductor, is essential to this asymmetry.

1. The measurement of the rotation curves (rcs) of disk galaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM), including its content relative to the baryonic components and their distributions.

2. Dwarf galaxies are good candidates to study DM due to their kinematics being generally dominated by the dark component, down to small galactocentric radii.

3. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a suitable test case to investigate the DM density profiles arising in cold dark matter (CDM) numerical simulations, as it has a well-understood baryonic matter distribution and a large discrepancy between luminous and dynamical mass.

4. Recent studies of the rcs of dwarf galaxies have tested the NFW scenario, which suggests that the DM halo is centrally peaked, but the kinematic data are better fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core.

5. The Orion dwarf galaxy has a high-quality, high-resolution rotation curve that can be easily corrected for asymmetric drift and tested for non-circular motions, making it an attractive candidate to determine the underlying gravitational potential of the galaxy.

6. The authors model the Orion dwarf as consisting of two ""luminous"" components, namely the stellar and the gaseous disks, embedded in a dark halo, and find that the cored profile of the halo universal rotation curve (URCH) fits the data extremely well.

7. The MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) model is discrepant with the data if we adopt the literature galaxy distance and gas mass, but the kinematic data can be reproduced in the MOND formalism if we allow for significant adjustments of the distance and/or value of the gas mass.

2. Conroy investigated the potential energy surfaces of the electronic ground state and lowest excited states at linear and isosceles triangular configurations, concluding that the trihydrogen dication is not stable.

3. Later studies by Schwartz and Schaad, Somorjai and Yue, and Berkowitz and Stocker did not address the stability problem, and Berkowitz and Stocker's charge stripping experiments could not find evidence of stable trihydrogen dication.

4. Shoucri and Darling examined equilateral configurations using the variational linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method, and Hernández and Carb studied two particular configurations with a more compact variational approach, but no bound state was determined in these calculations.

5. Johnson and Poshusta reported another single-point calculation in the context of Gaussian basis set optimization for one-electron systems, and Ackermann et al. revisited the question about the existence of trihydrogen dication using the finite element method, which provided higher accuracy than previously achieved.

6. The study concludes that accurate ab initio results on the basis of which the non-existence of trihydrogen dication can be demonstrated are scarce and not convincing, and the question is addressed again in the present study.

1. Recent investigations of galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have revealed a complex relationship between galaxy properties (such as color, luminosity, surface brightness, and concentration) and their environments. Galaxy clustering is found to be a function of both star formation history and luminosity, with low-luminosity galaxies clustering strongly by color and luminous galaxies clustering strongly by luminosity.

2. The study of galaxy environments as a function of luminosity and color has been conducted using the NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), which is a subsample of SDSS galaxies. The analysis has shown that the environments of low-luminosity, red galaxies become denser as absolute magnitude increases down to absolute magnitudes of -18.5 (about two magnitudes less luminous than explored by previous work).

3. The study has also found that the dependence of mean environment on color persists to the lowest luminosities explored, with red, low-luminosity galaxies tending to be in overdense regions down to at least -18.5. This result extends those found by previous studies towards lower luminosities by about 2 magnitudes.

4. The analysis has shown that at any given point of color and luminosity, a correlation function with a stronger amplitude implies a correlation function with a steeper slope. However, in regions of a given overdensity on small scales (0.5 Mpc), the overdensity on large scales (6 Mpc) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies.

5. The results of the study are consistent with the notion that only the masses of the host halos of the galaxies observed are strongly affecting the star formation of the galaxies, and therefore encourage the ""halo model"" description of galaxy formation and the pursuit of semi-analytic models which depend only on the properties of the host halo.

1. The source document discusses the role of transverse spin fluctuations in magnetic systems, particularly in the broken-symmetry state of antiferromagnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry. These fluctuations are gapless, low-energy excitations that play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties, such as the existence of long-range order and the magnitude of the order parameter.

2. In the strong-coupling limit, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature antiferromagnetic order parameter in two dimensions and the Neel temperature in three dimensions.

3. The document also explores the effect of defects, disorder, and vacancies on spin fluctuations in quantum antiferromagnets. In the random-α model, where α is set to zero on a fraction of sites, the lattice-averaged antiferromagnetic order parameter appears to be enhanced for small α, presumably due to the suppression of quantum spin fluctuations.

4. A new method is introduced for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state, in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).

5. The method is applied to the half-filled Hubbard model in two and three dimensions, and the results show that the quantum spin-fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization is nearly 1 for a certain range of interaction strength.

6. The document also studies the effect of spin vacancies on transverse spin fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic state. The results show that the quantum spin-fluctuation correction is sharply enhanced by spin vacancies, but the percolation limit nearly coincides with the point where the antiferromagnetic order parameter vanishes.

7. Finally, the document examines the effect of low-concentration impurities on transverse spin fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic state. The results show that the impurities lead to a substantial reduction in the averaged spin-fluctuation correction, but the local spin-fluctuation corrections are enhanced at the impurity sites.

1. The study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, particularly in cosmology, has received significant attention in recent years, driven by the need to understand inflation and its dynamics. The work has focused on multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation, leading to a variety of features unavailable in single-field models.

2. Researchers have developed a formalism to address the dynamics of nonequilibrium, coupled, time-varying scalar fields, which includes a renormalization procedure using dimensional regularization. This formalism has been applied to a two-field case, where the behavior of the quantized mode functions and the effect of fluctuations on the zero-mode equations of motion have been studied for various parameters, including small and large amplitude oscillations and large and weak coupling between two scalar fields.

3. The study has implications for the production of self-quanta and the transfer of energy density between fields in a cosmological context, particularly in supersymmetric hybrid inflationary models. The results suggest that the fluctuations in a supersymmetric hybrid model do not grow if the back reaction of the fluctuations is taken into account in the mean field evolution, and that the production of weakly interacting massive particles and baryogenesis via out-of-equilibrium decay in supersymmetric hybrid inflationary models may require a careful revaluation.

1. The paper discusses the extension of the Higgs Triplet Model (HTM) to include a dark matter candidate and a natural suppression mechanism for the lepton number violating parameter, which is responsible for generating tiny neutrino masses. The model introduces a new scalar field that breaks lepton number conservation, allowing for the generation of the lepton number violating parameter at the one-loop level.

2. The dark matter candidate in the model is composed of two CP-even neutral scalars, a CP-odd neutral scalar, and a charged pair, which are all odd under an unbroken Z2 symmetry. The model predicts that the dark matter candidate can be produced at the LHC and decays into a pair of charged leptons and jets, which can be detected by experiments.

3. The model also predicts that the lepton number violating parameter can be small, which is consistent with the measured neutrino masses. The suppression factor for the lepton number violating parameter is estimated to be around 10^-3, which is consistent with the measured neutrino masses. The model provides a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses without requiring heavy particles.

2. A quantum network will contain novel components, such as quantum memories, quantum repeaters, and quantum channels, which must operate in a strictly quantum way, and the question arises of how much imperfection can be tolerated before a device is no longer operating in a sufficiently quantum way.

3. To quantify the quantum behavior of a channel, a testing protocol can be employed by probing the channel using a source that prepares an entangled state, and determining the amount of entanglement that still remains afterwards, which can be compared to the entanglement of the initial state to determine the quantum throughput.

4. A method for estimating the effective entanglement in optical systems has been outlined, which begins with the observation that bounds can be obtained by looking at the most significant two-qubit subsystem, and the remainder of the method provides the necessary tools to calculate these bounds efficiently as a semidefinite program.

5. The quantification scheme has been applied to a simple channel where the test state is mixed at a beam-splitter with a thermalized vacuum, and the results show that the tolerable excess noise is around 5% of the vacuum for a transmittivity of 0.5, and that the two-qubit projection is tight to the entanglement verification curve for low overlaps, but becomes weaker for higher values.

2. A charged particle with spin 1/2 has a magnetic moment given by the gyromagnetic ratio, anomaly, and the latter expression is what one finds in the particle data tables.

3. The Dirac equation tells us that for spin 1/2 point-like particles, the gyromagnetic ratio is 2, and is unity for orbital angular momentum, which has been verified experimentally.

4. The anomaly arises from radiative corrections, and the lowest-order correction gives the famous Schwinger result, which was verified experimentally by Foley and Kusch.

5. The muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), and the relative contributions of heavier particles to the anomaly scales as 1/m^2, so the muon has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections.

6. The muon anomaly is sensitive to physics at the 100 GeV scale, and a discrepancy between the experimental value and the standard model prediction would signify the presence of new physics.

1. A recent paper by Li et al. presented a new design for an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which has several attractive features, including universality and the ability to study reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.

2. The reactive coupling in this system originates from the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator and further phase-dependent gradient forces.

3. The authors argue that this design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but instead of focusing on cooling, they examine other possibilities to investigate the effects arising from strong reactive coupling.

4. They report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting, which is different from the dispersive coupling used in previous works on normal mode splitting in optomechanical devices.

5. The authors calculate the expectation value of the output fields and obtain the nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes, showing that normal mode splitting occurs in the presence of reactive coupling but not in its absence.

6. They consider a system where a microdisk cavity is coupled to a freestanding waveguide, and a strong pump field and a weak Stokes field enter the system through the waveguide, causing the waveguide to move along a certain direction under the action of the optical force.

7. The authors find that the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity can result in normal mode splitting of the output fields, and the peak separation increases with increasing pump power.

8. They also observe that the reactive coupling can cause four-wave mixing, which creates an anti-Stokes component generated by the optomechanical system, and the maximum gain for the anti-Stokes field is about 0.1 for a pump power of 68 mW.

3. Theoretical studies have confirmed that the properties of transportation in closed quantum systems differ significantly from their classical counterparts, with a number of works done on introducing current of a quantity in the integrable Hamiltonian to observe its relaxation dynamics.

4. The introduction of magnetization current results in oscillatory nature and power-law decay of correlations in space, with a typical initial state with a steplike inhomogeneity in magnetization yielding a scaling form of the same in the large-time limit.

1. Studying QCD at finite baryon density is a traditional subject of nuclear physics, and understanding its behavior is crucial for astrophysics to comprehend the structure of compact stars and conditions near the core of collapsing stars.

2. It is known that sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase, which was proposed by Frautschi and Barrois by noticing that one-gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in the color antitriplet channel.

3. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, and to form bulk matter inside compact stars, the charge neutrality condition as well as chemical equilibrium are required, which induces a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks.

4. The Cooper pairing will be eventually destroyed with the increase of mismatch, and without the constraint from the charge neutrality condition, the system may exhibit a first-order phase transition from the color superconducting phase to the normal phase.

5. The system can experience a spatial non-uniform Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state in a certain window of moderate mismatch, and it is still not fully understood how the Cooper pairing will be eventually destroyed by increasing mismatch in a charge-neutral system.

6. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system, and if the charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally, and also if the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will be favored.

7. The homogeneous phase when the charge neutrality condition is required locally can be in the gapless 2SC (g2SC) phase or gapless CFL (gcFL) phase, depending on the flavor structure of the system, and the gapless state resembles the unstable Sarma state.

8. The g2SC and gcFL phases can exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram, and one of the most important properties of an ordinary superconductor is the Meissner effect, i.e., the superconductor expels the magnetic field.

9. The Meissner effect can be understood using the standard Anderson-Higgs mechanism, but unexpectedly, it was found that in the g2SC phase, the Meissner screening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken generators become imaginary, indicating a type of chromomagnetic instability in the g2SC phase.

1. The debate about the properties of the melting phase transition of two-dimensional (2D) systems has been ongoing for several decades, with recent developments in the fabrication of 2D materials potentially providing clarification on the details of the transition.

2. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) picture is the most widely accepted theory for the melting transition in 2D systems, which involves two separate, continuous transitions as the solid transforms into a liquid in quasi-equilibrium steps by slow heating.

3. However, the KTHNY theory assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which contradicts observations where dislocations accumulate into small-angle domain walls. Investigations have been conducted on various systems, including hard-sphere, Lennard-Jones, and Coulomb systems, as well as dipole-dipole and Debye-Hückel systems.

4. Recent studies have shown that the observation of the hexatic phase is strongly linked to the thermodynamic equilibration of the system, and that monitoring the velocity distribution function alone is insufficient to verify equilibration. The necessary equilibration time depends on the measured quantity of interest, with local properties equilibrating rapidly and long-range properties taking significantly longer.

5. Microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the relaxation of the velocity distribution function and the configurational temperature, which showed that the relaxation time scale is not sensitive to system size but has a strong dependence on temperature. The equilibration of long-range correlations is significantly slower and depends strongly on system size.

6. The study concludes that increasing system size alone can be insufficient and may result in misleading conclusions, as the length of the equilibration period also plays a crucial role in building up or destroying correlations. The authors suspect that many earlier numerical studies may have gotten stuck in the metastable hexatic phase instead of settling in the true equilibrium configuration.

1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4,100 planetary candidates in 3,200 systems, leading to a revolution in understanding planet occurrence rates around stars of all types. However, the assumption that all stars are single can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions, as undetected stellar companions can dilute the observed transit depth and lead to underestimated planetary radii.

2. The authors have developed a method to estimate the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. They have calculated the possible correction factors for each Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) based on the brightness and size differences between the primary star and potential secondary or tertiary companions.

3. The authors have found that if stars are assumed to be single and no companion vetting is performed, the planetary radii are underestimated, on average, by a factor of 1.5, corresponding to an overestimation of the planet bulk density by a factor of 1.5. However, if the KOIs are vetted with radial velocity observations and high-resolution imaging, the planetary radius mean correction necessary to account for undetected companions is reduced to a factor of 1.1, and for missions like K2 and TESS, the targets will only be underestimated by 10% with vetting.

1. The study aims to bridge the gap between the properties of neutral gas disks in nearby galaxies and those of Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (DLAs) at higher redshifts. However, due to technological limitations, direct observations of DLAs in 21-cm emission are impossible.

2. The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, but the detection efficiency depends on the brightness of the background source. The lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground due to the Earth's atmosphere.

3. The redshift number density of DLAs decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts, resulting in a limited number of known DLAs within the reach of present-day radio telescopes. As a result, the study relies on a wealth of information on cold gas properties in local galaxies and hundreds of DLA absorption profiles at intermediate and high redshifts.

4. The study uses high-resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to calculate the column density distribution function of HI. The results show that there is only mild evolution in the intersection cross-section of HI from redshift z=0.5 to the present.

5. The study finds that the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate and metallicities of DLAs, the luminosities of their host galaxies, and the impact parameters between centers of host galaxies and background QSOs. The results suggest that most DLAs arise in the HI disks of galaxies.

6. The study also finds that the metallicity distribution for HI column densities peaks around [O/H] = -1.5 to -1.0, much lower than the mean value of an L* galaxy. This is consistent with the hypothesis that DLAs arise in the HI disks of galaxies and that most of the DLAs cross-section is in sub-L* galaxies with sub-solar metallicities.

1. The formation of stars is thought to occur primarily in star clusters, with only a small percentage of gas being turned into stars during the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud.

2. As a result, young star clusters are initially composed of a combination of gas and stars, but the onset of stellar winds and supernovae explosions injects enough energy to remove the gas on timescales shorter than a crossing time.

3. This rapid gas loss causes the cluster to become out of equilibrium, leading to a significant change in its gravitational potential energy.

4. The effects of gas expulsion on young star clusters have been theoretically well understood, but its impact has received little consideration in observational studies of young massive star clusters.

5. Recent studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by measuring the velocity dispersion and half-mass radius, but have reported discrepant results, with some clusters showing non-standard IMFs and others showing standard Kroupa or Salpeter-type IMFs.

6. The youngest clusters (less than 100 Myr old) show a significant scatter in their IMF fits, suggesting that they may not be in virial equilibrium, which is a key assumption in these studies.

7. The authors present detailed luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters (M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1) and compare them with simulations of gas expulsion, finding that the observed profiles are consistent with the simulations.

8. The simulations show that gas expulsion can cause a significant excess of light at large radii, which is observed in many young star clusters, and can also lead to incorrect virial mass estimates for several tens of Myr.

9. The authors conclude that gas expulsion is an important phase in the evolution of young clusters that cannot be ignored, and that claims of unusual IMFs for young star clusters are likely due to the clusters being out of virial equilibrium.

1. Quantum fluctuations can suppress chaotic motion of a wave packet in phase space due to quantum interference, as seen in the kicked rotor model. However, in the kicked double-well model, quantum fluctuations can enhance chaotic motion due to the tunneling effect.

2. The relation between chaotic behavior and tunneling phenomenon in classically chaotic systems is an interesting and important subject in the study of quantum physics.

3. Researchers have developed a semiclassical description for tunneling phenomena in classically chaotic systems, and have studied the interplay between tunneling and classical chaos in various systems.

4. In a recent study, Lin and Ballentine found that coherent tunneling takes place between small isolated classical stable regions of phase space bounded by Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) surfaces in a double-well potential with an oscillatory driving force.

5. Hänggi and coworkers studied chaos-suppressed tunneling in a driven double-well model using the Floquet formalism and found a one-dimensional manifold in the parameter space where tunneling is completely suppressed by coherent driving.

6. The study of the mutual influence of quantum coherence and classical chaos has been ongoing for many years, but the additional effects caused by coupling the chaotic system to other degrees of freedom or an environment, namely decoherence and dissipation, have been studied only rarely.

7. Researchers have investigated environment-induced quantum decoherence by coupling the quantum system to a reservoir since the mid-1980s, and have recently studied quantum dissipation due to interaction with chaotic degrees of freedom.

8. In this paper, the authors numerically investigate the relation between quantum fluctuations, tunneling, and decoherence combined with delocalization in wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field.

9. The authors find that the transition probability from the localized wave packet to the delocalized state is enhanced by the polychromatic perturbation, and that the degree of coherence of the tunneling probability decreases as the perturbation strength increases.

10. The study suggests that the quantum fluctuations are always large for classically chaotic trajectories compared to regular ones, and that the quantum corrections to the evolution of phase space fluctuations become more dominant for classically chaotic trajectories.

1. The study of dissipative quantum dynamics in complex environments is a crucial topic in physics and chemistry, with significant progress made in understanding condensed phase dynamics using prototypical models such as the Caldeira-Leggett model and spin-boson model.

2. However, these models often rely on the assumption that the environment can be modeled as a bosonic bath, which may not accurately capture the behavior of real-world systems.

3. Recent studies have suggested that other bath models, such as fermionic and spin baths, play essential roles in physical and chemical processes.

4. The study proposes a unified stochastic framework to extend the study of dissipative quantum dynamics beyond the standard bosonic bath models.

5. The framework uses the Itô calculus rule to represent bilinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom as white noises, and derives the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) with appropriate statistical conditions.

6. The SLE is then used to devise a family of generalized hierarchical equations (GHE) to solve the equation with deterministic simulations.

7. The GHE approach is applied to bosonic, fermionic, and non-gaussian bath models, including spin baths, and is shown to provide numerically exact simulations for non-gaussian bath models with arbitrary spectral densities and temperature regimes.

8. The study also introduces a dual-fermion representation to map spin baths onto enlarged gaussian bath models of fermions, allowing for the application of the dual-fermion GHE.

9. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the dual-fermion GHE method, including a 50-spin bath and a spin-star model, demonstrating the accuracy of the method in capturing quantum dissipations.

10. The study concludes that the unified stochastic framework provides a powerful tool for studying dissipative quantum dynamics in complex environments, and can be applied to a wide range of physical and chemical systems.

1. The glass transition in the ni@xmath11zr@xmath12 system was studied using molecular dynamics simulations, and the critical temperature @xmath0 was estimated to be around 1005 K from the nonergodicity parameters, which is outside the range of the @xmath0 estimates from the high-temperature, ergodic melt. The @xmath0 values estimated from the dynamics in the undercooled melt when approaching @xmath0 from the high-temperature side were found to be around 950 K from the @xmath3-parameters and 1000 K from the diffusion coefficients.

2. The @xmath0 value estimated from the nonergodicity parameters is significantly different from the @xmath0 values estimated from the ergodic melt, but the deviation is much smaller than the factor of two found in the modelling of a lennard-jones system. The results suggest that the @xmath0 value may be underestimated by about 10 to 50 K due to the limited temperature range considered in the fit procedure.

1. The authors discuss the challenges of analyzing longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts, which can lead to biased estimates and poor coverage rates if not properly addressed.

2. They propose a fully Bayesian approach to deal with longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts based on a selection model, which accounts for the within-dyad correlation and the nonignorable dropout mechanism.

3. The proposed model includes a transition model to capture the longitudinal measurement process and a discrete time survival model to link the dropout process with the longitudinal measurement process.

4. The authors use a data augmentation approach to address the complex missing data problem caused by dropout and interdependence within dyads.

5. They conducted two simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, which showed that the proposed method yields consistent estimates with correct coverage rates.

6. The authors applied their methodology to the longitudinal dyadic data collected from a breast cancer study and identified more ""partner"" effects than the methods that ignore the missing data.

7. The results suggest that the patients and spouses are highly interdependent and influence each other's depression status, which can be useful for the design of more efficient depression prevention programs.

8. The authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine how the inference changes with respect to the values of the parameters that link the missing outcome with the dropout process.

9. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the estimates were quite stable, except for some variations in the estimates of the cancer stage and spouse's MPI in the measurement model of the spouse.

10. The authors conclude that their proposed method is not sensitive to the priors of the parameters and can provide extra insights into the interdependence of the dyads, which can be useful for the design of more efficient prevention programs.

1. The Casimir-Lifshitz force is a quantum effect that arises from the fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields between two neutral metallic or dielectric surfaces. This force is inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation and can be attractive or repulsive depending on the properties of the materials and the medium in which they are immersed.

2. The Casimir-Lifshitz force has been experimentally verified in several high-precision measurements, mainly focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum. However, less precise measurements in liquids have also been reported, and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids has been observed.

3. The Casimir-Lifshitz force is relevant for the development of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, and its effects have been studied in various configurations, including the interaction between anisotropic materials.

4. The torque between anisotropic materials, predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash, has been theoretically derived but not experimentally demonstrated. This torque arises from the anisotropy of the zero-point energy between the plates and generates a torque that makes the plates rotate towards configurations of smaller energy.

5. The authors propose a simpler experimental approach to demonstrate the rotation of a birefringent disk induced by quantum fluctuations. They consider a small birefringent disk made of quartz or calcite placed parallel to a birefringent barium titanate (BaTiO3) plate in vacuum or immersed in liquid ethanol.

6. The authors calculate the magnitude of the torque induced by quantum fluctuations for specific materials and discuss possible experimental validations of the effect. They show that the magnitude of the torque is within the sensitivity of available instrumentation, provided that the plate and the disk are kept at sub-micron distances.

7. The authors propose an experimental set-up to measure the rotation of the disk in liquid ethanol. The disk would float on top of the plate at a distance where the repulsive retarded van der Waals force balances gravity, giving rise to a mechanical bearing with ultra-low static friction.

8. The authors estimate that the rotation of the disk would be overdamped, and the disk would move asymptotically and monotonically towards the equilibrium position. They suggest that the experiment could be repeated by placing the disk over a non-birefringent plate to rule out spurious effects.

3. The subject has important implications for various scientific issues, including epidemics, web page classification through the PageRank algorithm, and community detection.

4. The authors introduce a new framework for the study of topologically biased random walks (TBRW) on graphs, which allows for the efficient exploration of network structure.

5. The TBRW approach uses topological properties of the network to bias the RW, enabling the efficient detection of communities and synchronization in complex networks.

6. The authors propose a novel methodology for community detection using TBRW, which involves creating suitable TBRW for community detection and analyzing the spectral properties of the transition matrix.

7. The methodology is tested on the Girvan-Newman (GN) benchmark, which is a commonly used benchmark for community detection algorithms.

8. The results show that the number of communities is related to the number of eigenvalues in the ""community band,"" and that the spectral gap shrinks as the bias increases.

9. The authors propose a set of criteria for choosing the parameters of the TBRW, including maximizing the gap between the ""community band"" and the rest of the eigenvalues, and shrinking the spectral gap.

1. The ability to gain control of a huge amount of internet hosts can be easily achieved by exploiting worms that self-propagate through popular internet applications and services.

2. Internet worms have already proven their capability of inflicting massive-scale disruption and damage to the internet infrastructure.

3. A new type of worm, called P2P worms, poses a serious threat to the internet as they leverage popular P2P overlay applications.

4. P2P worms can be grouped into two categories: passive P2P worms and active P2P worms. Passive P2P worms can be mitigated by current patching systems and reputation models.

5. Active P2P worms can utilize P2P overlay applications to retrieve information of vulnerable hosts and infect them, or be directly released in a hit list of P2P hosts to bootstrap the worm infection.

6. A holistic immunity system is proposed to provide mechanisms for both internal defense and external protection against active P2P worms, using a small subset of P2P overlay nodes called phagocytes.

7. Phagocytes are immune with high probability and specialize in finding and ""eating"" active P2P worms, monitoring their managed hosts' connection patterns and traffic volume to detect worm attacks.

8. The system includes four modules: detection, local isolation, alert propagation, and software patching, which can prevent internal active P2P worm attacks from being effectively mounted within the P2P overlay network.

9. The system also provides access control and filtering mechanisms for communication establishment between the P2P overlay and external hosts, using a novel adaptive and interaction-based computational puzzle scheme to prevent external hosts from attacking the P2P overlay.

The results show that HD 32297 has a strong circumstellar disk signature, with two absorption components detected, one of which is likely caused by circumstellar material. The study also finds that the interstellar absorption is similar among HD 32297 and its two closest neighbors, and is likely due to absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble.

The study estimates an upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding HD 32297 to be approximately 40.3 x 10^(-5) solar masses, assuming the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component are similar to those of the prototypical edge-on debris disk, HD 209458. The study also detects some indication of temporal variability in the circumstellar gas, but the data alone provide only a subtle indication of this variability.

1. The source document discusses the concept of gravity as a universal and fundamental force, and how anything with energy creates gravity and is affected by it, although the effects are often too weak to be measurable due to Newton's constant.

2. The document mentions that various theories of quantum gravity, such as string theory and black hole physics, predict the existence of a minimum measurable length, which is largely model-independent and can be understood through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

3. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle breaks down for energies close to the Planck scale, resulting in a modification of the commutators and the introduction of a minimum measurable length, which is approximately equal to the Planck length.

4. The document discusses the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which is a modification of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle that takes into account the effects of quantum gravity. The GUP is represented by the equation x_i p_i [ 1 + ( ( p)^2 + < p>^2 ) + 2 ( p_i^2 + < p_i>^2 ) ].

5. The document explains that the dimensionless parameter α is often assumed to be of the order of unity, but if this condition is not imposed, current experiments predict large upper bounds on α, which may signal the existence of a new length scale.

6. The document discusses the doubly special relativity (DSR) theories, which predict maximum observable momenta and suggest a similar modification of commutators. The commutators consistent with string theory, black holes physics, and DSR lead to the equation [x, p] = i [α^2].

7. The document investigates the effects of quantum gravity on the Planck era of the universe by employing different versions of the GUP. The modifications to several quantities that characterize the Planck era, such as the Planck time, length, mass, energy, density, and entropy, are evaluated.

8. The document finds that the Planck quantities predicted by the GUP are larger by a factor of α with respect to those found using the standard Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This result indicates that the quantum gravity corrections affect directly the main cosmological quantities in the early universe.

9. The document concludes that the entropic content of the universe at the Planck time remains the same, and the information remains unaltered, which is important since entropy is the cornerstone for one of the basic principles of quantum gravity named the holographic principle.

3. In the case of single-trace operators in the planar limit of N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM), great progress has been made in finding the spectrum using integrability, but much remains to be done in computing the couplings in 3-point correlation functions.

4. One strategy to compute the couplings in a CFT is to deform the theory from its fixed point with a marginal or irrelevant operator, which introduces new divergences in the renormalized operators of the critical theory.

5. The deformed anomalous dimension matrix can be used to compute the couplings in the 3-point function of the deformed theory, and this approach can be applied to other deformations, such as the beta deformation of N=4 SYM.

6. At strong coupling, the AdS/CFT duality can be used to compute the couplings in 3-point correlation functions, and this approach has been used to compute the 2-point function of single-trace operators with a large number of basic fields.

7. The AdS/CFT duality can also be used to compute 3-point correlation functions involving two insertions of an operator dual to a heavy string state and a chiral operator dual to a supergravity field.

8. The computation of the string theory partition function is based on a saddle point approximation to the string path integral that describes the propagation of the heavy state, and this approach can be used to include other chiral operators.

This scheme is particularly useful for studying surface electronic structure problems and defects in materials containing heavier elements.

2. The embedding scheme is derived using a trial function that is continuous in the large component and discontinuous in the small component across the surface separating the embedded region and the rest of the system. This leads to a discontinuous probability density, but the Dirac equation is first-order in the energy, resulting in a regular expectation value.

3. The scheme is applied to a model problem of a hydrogen atom within a spherical cavity, and the results show that the method is stable and converges to the exact eigenvalues. The green function for the embedded Hamiltonian is also derived and used to calculate the local density of states for the confined hydrogen system and an Au/Ag/Au sandwich structure.

4. The embedding scheme has potential applications to defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier elements within the framework of density functional theory. Further research is needed to explore the behavior of the alternative formulation of the method, the spectrum of negative energy solutions, and the possibility of embedding a relativistic region within a non-relativistic region.

1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their various applications, including microlasers and sensors, and their ability to serve as paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems.

2. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths, and wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength have been treated successfully with semiclassical methods.

3. These methods provide approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system, and in the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard.

4. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics.

5. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.

6. One of the most important tools in semiclassical physics are trace formulas, which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system.

7. The authors have developed a trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators and tested it for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2D dielectric microwave resonators and polymer microlasers of various shapes.

8. However, typical microlasers like those used in the references are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and while trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested, there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators.

9. The authors have investigated the precision of the 2D approximation for the length spectra of simple 3D dielectric cavities and found that the agreement between the experimental length spectrum and the semiclassical trace formula is good, but the peak positions of the trace formula deviate slightly from the lengths of the POs due to the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction.

1. The merger of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star are among the most important sources of gravitational waves, releasing huge energy in the process. The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) may radiate about 10^46 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4-1.6 kHz, which is covered by most ground-based laser interferometers.

2. The rate at which DNS coalescence events occur in the local universe is another parameter characterizing their potential as sources of gravitational waves. Despite the large amount of work performed in the past years, uncertainties persist in estimates of the DNS coalescence rate. A previous investigation revisited this question, taking into account the galactic star formation history derived directly from observations and including the contribution of elliptical galaxies.

3. Based on these results, a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and VIRGO respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations, was predicted. Besides the emission produced by the coalescence of the nearest DNS, the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves.

4. Numerical simulations using Monte Carlo methods were performed to estimate the occurrence of DNS coalescences and the gravitational stochastic background produced by these events. The results indicate that the density parameter Ωh has a maximum around 670 Hz (630 Hz for sfr1), attaining an amplitude of about 1.4 × 10^(-6) (1.4 × 10^(-7) for sfr1). The computed signal is below the sensitivity of the first and the second generation of detectors, but using the planned sensitivity of third-generation interferometers, the cross-correlation of two EGO-like coincident antennas gives an optimized signal-to-noise ratio of 1.4.

1. The backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock in the context of diffusive acceleration at Newtonian shock fronts is a complex phenomenon that has been extensively studied. The current status of investigations is discussed in recent reviews, and while much is well understood, some issues are still debated due to their theoretical and phenomenological implications.

2. The backreaction occurs when the acceleration process becomes efficient enough to generate pressures of accelerated particles comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure, leading to changes in the spectrum of particles and the structure of the shock. This phenomenon is intrinsically nonlinear, and there are three viable approaches to account for the backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approaches, and analytical approaches.

3. The analytical approaches, including perturbative and non-perturbative methods, have been developed to understand the physics of nonlinear effects in shock acceleration. These approaches have been used to study the effects of the backreaction on the maximum achievable energy of particles and the geometry of the shock. The need for a practical solution of the acceleration problem in the nonlinear regime has been recognized, and some promising analytical solutions have appeared in the literature.

4. The author proposes a semi-analytical approach to study the backreaction of particles accelerated at a shock, including the seed particles that may be present in the region where the shock is propagating. The approach is used to investigate the critical behavior of shocks and the modification of the shock by the backreaction of accelerated particles. The results show that the presence of seed particles can change the critical behavior of shocks and that the nonlinearity of the shock can be dominated by the presence of preaccelerated particles rather than by the acceleration of particles from the thermal pool.

Various models have been proposed to explain dark energy, including the cosmological constant, quintessence, and modified gravity theories.

Three viable teleparallel gravity models are examined, and their free parameters are constrained using BBN calculations based on current observational data. The results show that these models can satisfy the BBN constraints, providing an additional advantage of teleparallel gravity as a candidate for describing the gravitational interaction.

3. The proposed protocol requires the instantaneous CSI of the involved links in each time slot and their long-term statistics, and it achieves the maximum sum rate in the considered bidirectional network.

1. The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination can be used as a ""standard ruler"" to measure the matter and energy content of the universe, but this method relies on accurate measurements of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum.

2. If the CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, the misinterpretation could spread to the low-redshift application and bias the inferences.

3. However, the interpretation of the low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are robustly measured in the CMB.

4. The actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation, and only their ratio matters, making the method robust to uncertainties in the matter density.

5. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, depends only on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma.

6. The sound speed depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio, which is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum, and the redshift of equality, which is also well measured.

7. The acoustic peak method can deal with uncertainties in the matter density provided that the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well measured, and the anisotropies of the CMB have good leverage on this quantity.

8. Other cosmological measurements, such as galaxy surveys, weak lensing surveys, and cluster abundance measurements, can also constrain the actual densities and thereby constrain the presence of unknown relativistic species.

4. They investigate the consequences of this ansatz, assuming that the neutrinos are represented by 2-component spinors and that the mass matrix is an arbitrary symmetric complex matrix.

5. The authors consider the case where the mass matrix is hermitian, which leads to a real symmetric matrix that can be brought to real diagonal form via a real rotation.

6. They use the results of a recent preliminary analysis of all neutrino experiments by Ohlsson and Snellman to fit the data without assuming any CP violation, which agrees with assuming the neutrino mass matrix to be real.

7. The authors found two essentially different solutions in this case, one featuring two neutrinos with approximately equal mass and a third neutrino of mass 1.217 eV, and the other featuring two neutrinos with approximately degenerate mass and a third neutrino with a mass 0.608 eV.

8. They also considered the case of complex neutrino mass matrix, which allows a larger number of solutions, and found that the type II solutions with complex neutrino mass matrix have the largest mass sum to be about 4.5 eV, which is on the very border of acceptability for non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay.

9. The authors note that the neutrinos may be massive enough to play a role in cosmology, and that the relevant criterion for this to occur is usually stated as a mass sum of about 4.5 eV.

10. They conclude that the ansatz for the neutrino mass matrix provides information complementary to what would be gotten from a complete three-flavor analysis of all lepton number conserving neutrino oscillation experiments, and that it can be used to reconstruct the underlying neutrino mass matrix.

1. The contact pattern among individuals in a population is a crucial factor in the spread of infectious diseases, and deterministic models often use a contact rate function to model transmission.

2. Network analysis methods can investigate the contact structure among individuals and analyze its effects on disease spread, providing a more precise understanding of the dynamics.

3. Scale-free networks, which show a power-law degree distribution, are common in real-world networks, including human sexual contacts, and may have epidemiological implications due to faster epidemic propagation.

4. Epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected (SI) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models, have been used to study the transmission dynamics of diseases in scale-free networks.

5. Simulating the spread of diseases on scale-free networks can provide insights on how to prevent and control them, and the study found that networks with the same degree distribution can show very different structural properties.

6. The study used the Barabasi-Albert (BA) algorithm to generate scale-free networks and compared the results with other network models, such as the Molloy-Reed (MR) and Kalisky algorithms.

7. The simulations showed that the prevalence of the disease tends to stabilize at a certain level, and the increase in the number of edges leads to an increase in the prevalence of the disease.

8. The study found that the topological features of a network can influence the dynamics on the network, and the prevention of potentially infectious contacts may contribute to controlling a disease in cases of sanitary emergency.

1. The Levi-Civita (LC) spacetime, a solution to Einstein's equations, presents challenges in its interpretation, particularly with regards to its physical meaning and the role of its two essential constants, @xmath3 and @xmath0.

2. The constant @xmath4 is related to the topology of spacetime and the deficit angle, while @xmath0 is the parameter that presents the most serious obstacles to interpretation.

3. For small values of @xmath0, the LC spacetime describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass with mass @xmath0 per unit coordinate length.

4. As @xmath0 increases, the spacetime becomes flat, and circular timelike geodesics exist only for certain values of @xmath0, becoming null when @xmath8 and spacelike for @xmath9.

5. The Kretschmann scalar diminishes monotonically as @xmath0 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11, vanishing at @xmath12, and implying that the space is flat.

6. The LC spacetime has no horizons, suggesting that there may be an upper limit to the mass per unit length of line sources, below the critical linear mass.

7. An anisotropic fluid matched to the LC spacetime produces an effective mass per unit length that has a maximum at @xmath20, which might explain the inexistence of horizons.

8. The interpretation of the LC spacetime as the gravitational field produced by an infinite plane with positive or negative mass density is problematic due to the asymmetry between the negative and positive mass cases.

9. The LC spacetime has been analyzed using gedanken experiments with a gyroscope circumventing the axis of symmetry, which provides additional elements for the interpretation of the LC spacetime.

10. The results of these analyses suggest that the LC spacetime may not be interpreted as the gravitational field produced by an infinite sheet of either positive or negative mass density, and that the meaning of the coordinate @xmath2 in the LC spacetime is different from its usual interpretation as an angle coordinate.

1. Quantum information processing has attracted significant interest in recent years, following Deutsch's investigations into the potentiality of a quantum computer, which stores and processes information in quantum systems.

2. Quantum information carriers offer outstanding possibilities, such as secret communication (quantum cryptography) and the implementation of quantum networks and algorithms that are more efficient than classical ones.

3. Investigations have focused on the transmission of quantum information from one party (Alice) to another (Bob) through a communication channel, with the information encoded in qubits.

4. The problem of determining the properties of the quantum channel has not been thoroughly investigated, with the exception of recent articles, and is essential for the reliable transfer of quantum information and the construction of quantum codes.

5. The goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector that characterizes the quantum channel, and the protocol involves Alice and Bob agreeing on a set of quantum states, which are prepared by Alice and sent through the quantum channel.

6. Bob receives the states and performs measurements on them, from which he deduces an estimated vector that should be as close as possible to the underlying parameter vector of the quantum channel.

7. The determination of the properties of a quantum channel is crucial for any quantum communication protocol, and the behavior of such channels is generally not known from the beginning, so methods must be found to gain this knowledge.

8. The use of entangled pairs can enhance the estimation scheme for the pauli channel, and the estimation strategy based on condition (condition) can be applied to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, such as the generalized pauli channel.

9. The quality of the estimation strategy can be quantified with the help of a cost function, and the statistical error can be used to evaluate the quality of the estimation.

1. The study aims to establish a more complete mathematical model for the phenomenology of high-energy nuclear collisions, focusing on the hadronic final state of collisions at 200 GeV. The model should provide a conceptual context with two manifestations: a mathematical framework to represent data systematics efficiently and a theoretical framework to provide physical interpretation of model elements via comparisons between data structures and QCD theory.

2. The study investigates several unresolved aspects of collisions, including the role of collision centrality in relation to the low-x gluon transverse structure of the proton, the nature and systematics of the underlying event (UE), the systematics of minimum-bias (MB) dijet production, and the possible existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component in 2D angular correlations.

3. The study presents a two-component model (TCM) for hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions, which accurately describes most final-state hadron yield and spectrum systematics. However, the TCM must be extended to include the nonjet quadrupole as a third component of all high-energy nuclear collisions. The study also confirms the extrapolation of the nonjet quadrupole centrality trend to Au+Au collisions and determines the dependence of the nonjet quadrupole on centrality.

1. The authors have developed a novel method to derive Lindblad master equations using stochastic methods and operator techniques, which allows for the derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations. This method is based on the idea of building random evolution operators that contain the decohering effect of the environment and then taking the stochastic expectation value with respect to this randomness.

2. The authors have applied this method to various physical systems, including the Jaynes-Cummings model with phase damping, and have shown that it can be used to solve master equations and to generalize intrinsic decoherence models. They have also compared their results with experimental data in cavity QED and ion traps, and have argued that the method has the advantage of allowing for the study of decohering effects not necessarily rooted on the environmental action upon the system.

1. The study focuses on the localization length of light in one-dimensional disordered systems, specifically in homogeneous and mixed stacks of layers with different refractive indices and thicknesses.

2. The researchers used numerical calculations to determine the localization length, which is a measure of how far light can travel in a disordered system before being localized.

3. The study found that for homogeneous stacks, the localization length exhibits a quadratic dependence on wavelength at long wavelengths, and saturates at short wavelengths.

4. The researchers also found that the localization length is modulated by the transmission bands in the system, and this modulation decreases with increasing disorder.

5. In the case of mixed stacks, the localization length exhibits a linear dependence on wavelength at long wavelengths, with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.

6. The study also found that the localization length saturates at low wavelengths, with the saturation constant proportional to the inverse of the reflection coefficient between alternating layers.

7. The researchers developed an empirical equation to describe the localization length in the linear region of mixed stacks, which is valid for a wide range of reflection coefficients.

8. The study also found that the localization length exhibits an irregular form in the transmission spectrum when the condition of symmetric band distribution is not satisfied, and this effect is more pronounced in mixed stacks than in homogeneous structures.

1. The concordance model of cosmology suggests that ordinary matter, which makes up 4% of the universe's mass-energy, is not enough to explain the observed phenomena, and that dark matter and dark energy are necessary to account for the remaining 96%.

2. Dark matter is thought to make up 23% of the universe's mass-energy and is composed of non-baryonic matter, the nature of which is unknown. The remaining 73% is attributed to dark energy, which is a mysterious energy that is thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe.

3. The concordance model of cosmology, also known as the ΛCDM model, is supported by a wide range of observational evidence, including the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the cosmic microwave background radiation.

4. The ΛCDM model predicts that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which are particles that interact with normal matter only through the weak nuclear force and gravity.

5. The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory, proposed by Mordehai Milgrom, is an alternative to the ΛCDM model that attempts to explain the observed phenomena without invoking dark matter. MOND modifies the law of gravity at low accelerations, resulting in a different prediction for the rotation curves of galaxies.

6. The MOND theory has been successful in reproducing the observed rotation curves of galaxies, but it has several problems, including the prediction of a central density peak in the dark matter halo and the formation of satellite galaxies.

7. A new approach to explaining the observed phenomena is to modify the law of gravity at low accelerations, rather than invoking dark matter. This approach, known as TeVeS, modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action to include a new vector field that couples to the matter density.

8. The TeVeS theory has been successful in reproducing the observed rotation curves of galaxies, but it has several problems, including the prediction of a central density peak in the dark matter halo and the formation of satellite galaxies. An alternative approach is to consider a new type of matter, known as ""dipolar dark matter,"" which is composed of aligned dipole moments that interact with normal matter through gravity.

1. The study focuses on the properties of heteropolymers, specifically polyampholytes (pas), which are long chain macromolecules with randomly charged groups. The goal is to understand the behavior of pas in different space dimensions and temperatures.

2. The study uses a statistical approach to describe the behavior of pas, but also focuses on simple models that include essential ingredients. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups is controlled by Coulomb interactions, which are the strongest and have the longest range.

3. The study considers a model polyampholyte (pa) with a flexible chain, where each monomer has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches. The polymer has a characteristic microscopic length, and the numerical studies simplify the model by considering only self-avoiding walk (SAW) configurations on a cubic lattice.

4. The study explores the phase diagrams of quenched pas in different space dimensions and finds that for d=3, the behavior of pas is similar to that of random chains with short-range interactions, while for d=4, the spatial conformations of a pa strongly depend on its excess charge.

5. The study uses complete enumeration to calculate the ground state energies of pas and finds that the ground state energy is quite insensitive to the details of the sequence, with a clear separation of energies into bands corresponding to excess charges of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14.

6. The study estimates the condensation energy of pas and finds that it is surprisingly close to that of a regular crystal, despite the fact that in a random chain, one neighbor along the chain has the ""wrong"" sign, costing an energy of the order of 0.1.

7. The study also estimates the surface tension of pas and finds that it is consistent with the known value of 0.1.

8. The study finds that the ground state of a sufficiently long annealed pa with fixed excess charge is the NaCl structure, and that the optimal configurations correspond to a uniform distribution of excess charge along the backbone.

9. The study discusses the instabilities of charged 7-dimensional drops and finds that a charged conducting drop can lower its energy by expelling a large number of ""dust particles"" which carry away the entire charge.

1. The study focuses on half-metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures, which are ideal for spintronics applications. Cr-doped dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) and Cr-based alloys, particularly CrAs and CrSb, have attracted attention due to their potential for complete spin polarization of carriers and high Curie temperatures.

2. Theoretical calculations have verified the half-metallic character of CrAs, and experimental studies have shown that thin films of CrAs and CrSb exhibit ferromagnetic behavior at temperatures above 400 K and magnetic moments of 3 μB per CrAs unit.

3. The study investigates the variation of magnetic properties, particularly exchange interactions and Curie temperatures, of Cr-based pnictides and chalcogenides as a function of lattice parameter. The calculations were performed using the TB-LMTO-CPA method and the exchange-correlation potential given by Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair.

4. The results show that the half-metallic ferromagnetic character of these compounds is preserved over a wide range of lattice parameters, and the Curie temperatures are relatively high, with values ranging from 500 K to 1100 K. However, the ground states of some compounds, such as CrS and CrSe, are antiferromagnetic or complex magnetic at low lattice parameters.

5. The study also investigates the effects of anion doping on the magnetic properties of Cr-based alloys. The results show that the mixed pnictide-chalcogenide alloys CrAs@x@x (x = Sb, S, Se, Te) do not show any tendency to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for the entire range of lattice parameters studied.

6. The Curie temperatures of the alloys are determined using the mean-field approximation (MFA) and the random-phase approximation (RPA), and the results show that the Curie temperatures are relatively high, with values ranging from 500 K to 1100 K. The study provides both qualitative and quantitative guidance to experimentalists in the field of spintronics.

They assume a plane-parallel geometry and neglect the effects of magnetic fields, adopting the Spitzer conductivity for a fully ionized plasma.

2. The authors introduce the concept of thermal instability, which allows the gas to coexist at different phases. They show that the thermal instability condition is equivalent to the instability condition discovered by Field (1965). The authors also discuss the existence of transition layers between stable phases, where the gas temperature may change by orders of magnitude over a geometrically thin region.

3. The authors calculate the temperature profiles and optical depths of the transition layers and possible intermediate stable layers. They find that the existence of an intermediate stable layer enhances the emission in the soft X-ray band, particularly for ions with peak abundances at temperatures close to that of the intermediate stable layer.

4. The authors compare the recombination emission and reflection lines from the transition layers and intermediate stable layer to the Compton reflection ""hump"" produced by Compton scattering off a cold surface. They find that the equivalent widths of the recombination emission and reflection lines are at most a few tenths of an electronvolt, but can be orders of magnitude larger when the primary continuum is obscured.

1. Polymers with a contour length much larger than their persistence length are considered flexible and can be described using quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. However, if the chain length decreases, the chain stiffness becomes an important factor.

2. Many polymer molecules have internal stiffness and cannot be modeled by the flexible polymer model developed by Edwards. The standard coarse-graining model of a wormlike polymer was proposed by Kratky and Porod.

3. The Kratky-Porod model includes a penalty for bending energy and local inextensibility, making its treatment more difficult. Despite this, there have been numerous studies on the model in the last half century.

4. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the theoretical description of semiflexible polymers due to potential applications in biology and research on semicrystalline polymers.

5. The transverse distribution function of a polymer embedded in two-dimensional space was found to possess a bimodal shape for short polymers, which is considered a manifestation of semiflexibility.

6. The authors of the paper studied the transverse distribution function of the three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation of one polymer end using the exact representation of the distribution function in terms of the matrix element of the Green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field.

7. The authors found that the transverse distribution function of the 3D wormlike chain possesses a bimodal shape in the intermediate range of chain lengths, which is consistent with recent studies on the 2D wormlike chain.

8. The authors also presented analytical results for short and long wormlike chains based on the exact formula, which are in complete agreement with previous results obtained using different methods.

1. A graph is defined as a simple graph with vertex set and edge set, and a labeling of the graph is a bijection from the vertex set to the set of integers from 1 to n. A labeling is closed if whenever there are two distinct edges with one endpoint smaller than the other, then the other endpoint is also smaller.

2. A graph is closed if it has a closed labeling, and closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals. The binomial edge ideal of a labeled graph is the ideal in the polynomial ring generated by the binomials for all pairs of edges with one endpoint smaller than the other.

3. A key result states that the binomials form a Gröbner basis of the binomial edge ideal for lex order with a specific variable order if and only if the labeling is closed. The name ""closed"" was introduced in a paper, and binomial edge ideals are explored in several other papers.

4. The paper aims to characterize when a graph has a closed labeling in terms of properties that can be seen directly from the graph. The starting point is a result that every closed graph is chordal and claw-free.

5. A connected graph is narrow if every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path. The paper proves that every connected closed graph is narrow, and the main result is that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow.

6. The proof of the main result involves an algorithm for labeling connected graphs, and the paper shows that the labeling produced by the algorithm is closed when the input graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow.

7. The paper also shows that the chordal hypothesis can be replaced with the weaker hypothesis that all cycles of length 3, 4, or 5 have a chord, and the main result is based on the senior honors thesis of the second author.

The cosmic ray spectrum has been observed as a continuum at all energies since its discovery in the 20th century, with the high-energy tail corresponding to energies up to 3 x 10^20 eV and rates of a few particles per km^2 per century. The spectrum is featureless and decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy.

2. The observed flux of high-energy cosmic rays requires techniques that take advantage of extensive air showers, which are successive secondary particles that cascade down into the atmosphere. Shower measurements allow the reconstruction of arrival directions and shower energy, but the nature of the primary particle is extracted by indirect methods.

3. The composition of high-energy cosmic rays is still unknown, but studies suggest that there may be a change in the spectral slope and composition for energies above 2 x 10^18 eV. The data also show no firm evidence of anisotropy, but the significance of such studies is limited by poor statistics.

4. The study of inclined showers, which are air showers that occur at high zenith angles, has the potential to double the acceptance of air shower arrays and provide a new tool for studying photon composition. By analyzing the muon density patterns in inclined showers, researchers can determine the primary energy and composition of the cosmic rays, and the results have been compared to simulations and found to be in good agreement.

Optical lattices are artificial crystals of light formed by interference of two or more laser beams, and they can be used to create one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional lattices. Atoms can be cooled and trapped in these lattices, allowing for the investigation of quantum behavior and condensed matter phenomena.

Theoretical models, such as the Hubbard model, have been used to describe these phenomena, and experiments have been performed to test these models.

1. The iron pnictides are a well-established prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with several sub-families and a wide structural variety. They exhibit interesting and sometimes puzzling magnetic behavior, including a phase transition from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic crystal symmetry accompanied by the formation of long-range antiferromagnetic order.

2. The suppression of these phase transitions, for example by chemical substitution, is crucial for the emergence of unconventional superconductivity. However, understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is a complex task, with ongoing debates about the role of correlation effects and the magnitude of magnetic moments.

3. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an important experimental tool for investigating the electronic structure of the iron pnictides, but it has problems reproducing all features of the ARPES spectra correctly due to strong correlation effects. The connection between the magnetic phase and the resulting consequences for ARPES is also a significant challenge.

4. A comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study was performed to address the issue of magnetic anisotropy in ARPES data, using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-Green function (KKR-GF) approach and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with disorder due to substitution.

2. XB158 exhibits strong intensity modulation on a 12.78-hour period, which has been observed in multiple X-ray observations, including those from ROSAT and XMM-Newton.

3. Analysis of the lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, with no evidence for dips in the two previous orbital cycles, suggesting that the disk is precessing, with dips only visible for some part of the super-orbital cycle.

4. The disk precession is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in low-mass ratio systems, where the disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the donor star, causing the disk to elongate and precess.

5. Fitting a sinusoidal variation component to the lightcurve of XB158 revealed a 5.65-day super-orbital period, with a factor of 15 variation in luminosity, consistent with the range of luminosities observed in the ACIS observations of the 13-year Chandra monitoring campaign.

6. The suggested super-orbital period is 70% longer than predicted by 3D SPH simulations, which may be due to the mass ratio of the donor to the accretor being lower than assumed, and the system may contain a particularly massive neutron star.

The authors propose a generalization of one-dimensional PT-symmetric nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which can be used as fundamental building blocks for constructing PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. They introduce four basic types of plaquettes, three of which are four-site squares, and the final one is a five-site cross. The authors analyze the modes that can be found in an analytical form and study their stability against small perturbations using numerical methods.

2. The authors find many effects, including the existence of solution branches that terminate at the critical points of the respective linear PT-symmetric systems, and the bifurcation responsible for the termination of the pair of branches may take a complex degenerate form. They also identify cases where the PT symmetry is broken immediately after the introduction of the gain-loss pattern, and the spectral stability of the different configurations is examined. Most frequently, the stationary modes are unstable, although stable branches were found too. The authors also study the perturbed dynamics of the modes and observe that the passive sites, without gain or loss, might be tipped towards growth or decay, depending on the particular solution and possibly on specific initial conditions.

2. The presence of two planets in the system, a 5.7 planet in a tight orbit with an eccentricity of 0.2 and a 7.6 planet in a wider orbit with an eccentricity of 0.6, has been suggested by detailed timing analysis, although the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year time scale.

3. The planets' orbits can be used to constrain the CV evolution and reconstruct the history of the inner binary, with the planets providing unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and evolution of the system.

4. The presence of the inner planet allows us to break the degeneracy between the donor mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow, its radius, and the mass of its core, and derive the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase.

5. The outer planet can be used to validate this calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born, with the requirement that the initial binary must have been dynamically stable further constraining the masses of the two stars and their orbital separation.

6. By reconstructing the initial conditions of the binary system with its two planets, we can test its dynamical stability and derive the rate of mass lost in the common-envelope phase, with the measured rate of mass loss for HU AQR consistent with numerical common-envelope studies.

1. The experimental evidence of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction has intrigued scientists, and the preparation of thin films of B20 type MnSi on silicon substrates has offered promising prospects for spintronic devices.

2. MnSi films offer a variety of interesting magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the use of silicon as substrate material, which is well-established in technology.

3. The benefit of thin films compared to bulk material is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to uniaxial anisotropy, which pioneers new opportunities for data storage devices.

4. However, the drawback of using MnSi films is the low magnetic ordering temperature, which is considerably below liquid nitrogen temperature, making it necessary to find compounds with similar spin order at higher temperatures.

5. A suitable candidate is the B20 compound MnGe, which has a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3 nm at lowest temperatures and 6 nm near the ordering temperature.

6. The MnGe films have been grown on Si(111) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with the aid of a MnSi seedlayer, and the structure and morphology of the films have been investigated by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

7. The magnetic characterization of the MnGe films has been carried out using a Quantum Design MPMS-5S SQUID magnetometer, and the susceptibility of MnGe films exhibits an ordering temperature of 200K, which is enhanced compared to bulk MnGe.

8. The magnetoresistivity measurements show no critical fields up to 5T, and the helix in MnGe is shorter and more rigid than in MnSi, making the magnetic structure related to antiferromagnetism rather than ferromagnetism.

1. A polynomial is called postcritically finite if the forward orbits of its critical points are finite, and the filled Julia set of a polynomial contains a forward invariant, finite topological tree called the Hubbard tree.

2. The core entropy of a polynomial is the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its Hubbard tree, and it is a measure of the complexity of the polynomial's dynamics.

3. The main goal of the paper is to prove that the core entropy function extends to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers.

4. The paper uses an algorithm devised by Thurston to compute the core entropy for rational angles, which involves constructing a matrix that represents the dynamics of the polynomial on its Hubbard tree.

5. The paper also develops a combinatorial theory of labeled wedges, which are used to construct infinite graphs that capture the essential features of the polynomial's dynamics.

6. The growth rate of a graph is defined as the exponential growth rate of the number of its closed paths, and it is shown that the growth rate of a graph is equal to the inverse of the smallest real positive root of its spectral determinant.

7. The paper uses the theory of labeled wedges to prove that the growth rate of the graph associated to a periodic labeled wedge is equal to the growth rate of its finite model.

8. The paper also proves that the core entropy function is continuous at all angles that are not purely periodic, and it uses the theory of labeled wedges to prove that the core entropy function is continuous at all angles.

9. The paper uses Rouch's theorem to prove that the core entropy function is Hlder continuous at angles that are not purely periodic.

10. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the results and the future directions of research in the field of complex dynamics.

1. The detection of X-ray, optical, and radio afterglows from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has confirmed that most long GRBs are of cosmological origin, supporting the fireball model. However, the puzzle of GRBs remains unsolved, particularly the issue of whether GRBs are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs.

2. Three methods have been proposed to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: the first method involves analyzing the light curve of optical afterglows for a break during the relativistic phase, but this method is not conclusive due to the smoothness of the break and the presence of other factors that can cause light curve breaks.

3. The second method involves observing the polarization of optical afterglows from jetted GRBs, but this method is also not conclusive due to the conditions required for polarization to be observed. The third method involves searching for orphan afterglows, which are afterglows that are not associated with any detectable GRBs, but this method is also challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between jetted GRB orphans and isotropic fireball orphans.

4. The concept of ""failed GRBs"" (fGRBs) has been proposed, which refers to fireballs with a Lorentz factor much less than 100 but still much greater than unity. fGRBs can produce orphan afterglows that are similar to those of successful GRBs, making it difficult to determine the nature of orphan afterglows and the beaming angle of GRBs.

1. The article discusses the study of two gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), GRB 011211 and GRB 001025, using data from the XMM-Newton satellite. The study aimed to understand the properties of GRB afterglows and their environments.

2. GRB 011211 was detected by the BeppoSAX satellite on December 11, 2001, and was found to have a long duration and faintness in both X-ray and optical wavelengths. The afterglow was detected in the optical R-band and was found to have a redshift of z=2.14.

3. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 011211 was observed by XMM-Newton on December 12, 2001, and was found to have a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.16. The spectrum was modified by galactic absorption only, and no significant spectral evolution was detected during the observation.

4. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 001025 was observed by XMM-Newton on October 27, 2000, and was found to have a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.01. The spectrum was also modified by galactic absorption, and no significant flux variability was detected.

5. The study found that the X-ray spectra of both GRBs were consistent with a simple power-law model, and no significant absorption above the galactic value was detected. This is in contrast to expectations, as high absorption would be expected if the bursts occur in high-density star-forming regions.

6. The study also found that the X-ray spectra of both GRBs were consistent with the popular model of synchrotron emission, with possible inclusion of inverse Compton scattering. The spectra were also consistent with the lack of optical detections in a significant fraction of GRBs.

7. The study analyzed the X-ray spectrum of GRB 011211 and found that it was featureless and did not contain any significant line emission. This is in contrast to a previous study that reported the detection of a blue-shifted line complex in the spectrum of GRB 011211.

8. The study concluded that the X-ray afterglows of both GRBs were consistent with the expected properties of GRB afterglows, and that the lack of absorption and the featureless spectra were consistent with the popular model of synchrotron emission.

1. Researchers have studied the layered organic material AI3, which has been found to exhibit low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure. The material is strikingly different from graphene in several respects, including a smaller average Fermi velocity and a low-temperature charge-ordered phase at ambient pressure, indicating the relevance of electronic correlations.

2. The study presents magneto-transport measurements of AI3 crystals under high pressure, revealing the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes. The interplay between these two carrier types at low energy is the main result of the study, and the results are consistent with ab-initio calculations of the band structure of AI3 under pressure. The study also investigates the ratio of the mobilities of the massive and Dirac carriers, which is found to be significantly lower than expected, indicating that the scattering times for the two types of carriers are different.

1. The study analyzed the spin response of iron-based superconductors (FeBS) with two different superconducting gap scales, and found that the spin resonance appears in the s± state below the indirect gap scale, which is determined by the sum of gaps on two different Fermi surface sheets connected by the scattering wave vector.

2. For the Fermi surface geometry characteristic to most FeBS materials, the indirect gap is either 4 or 5 meV, giving a simple criterion to determine whether the experimentally observed peak in inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is the true spin resonance.

3. The study combined data on the peak frequency and maximal and minimal gap sizes available in the literature, and found that in electron-doped BaFe1.85Co0.15As2, NaFeAs, and FeSe systems, the peak in INS is the true spin resonance evidencing sign-changing gap.

4. Some hole-doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 materials satisfy the condition for sign-changing gap, but the calculation of the spin response for the particular experimental band structure is required to make a final conclusion.

5. The study also found that the only case when the condition for sign-changing gap is not satisfied is FeTe0.7Se0.3, and that ARPES in all cases gives gap values larger than extracted from other techniques, raising the question of whether ARPES overestimates or other methods underestimate superconducting gaps.

1. The presence of impurities in a quantum system can significantly modify its spectrum, coherence, and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, a mobility edge exists in 3D systems, while in 1D and 2D systems, all states are exponentially localized.

2. However, if the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum. This was demonstrated in 1D systems using the random dimer model (RDM) and its dual version (DRDM).

3. The authors introduce a 2D extension of the DRDM, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites. Using a decimation and renormalization procedure, they show that a resonance energy exists at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized.

4. In the presence of weak interactions, the 2D-DRDM drives the homogeneity of the ground state, inducing a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength. The resonance energy is at the origin of these phenomena.

5. The authors show that short-range correlations in a disordered potential can modify and enhance the coherence of a many-body system in the weak interacting regime. This effect could be measured in the context of ultracold atoms and has implications for the study of homogeneous systems with engineered impurities.

1. The problem of finding the maximum independent set in a graph is NP-hard, and many attempts have been made to find upper and lower bounds or exact values for special classes of graphs, including generalized Petersen graphs.

2. The independence number of a graph is the cardinality of a largest set of independent vertices, and an independent set of size α(G) is called an α-set. The maximum independent set problem is to find an independent set with the largest number of vertices in a given graph.

3. For even n and k, the authors provide an upper bound for α(G) and a lower bound for α(G), and for odd n and even k, they provide a lower bound for α(G). They also show that the upper bound and lower bound are very close to each other for every fixed even k.

4. The authors prove that the independence number of generalized Petersen graphs with fixed k can be found in linear time, and they show that for every fixed k and any integer n, the treewidth of G is bounded.

5. They also provide a table of the independence number of G for different values of n and k, and they thank the referee, professor E.S. Mahmoodian, and others for their help and comments.

1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often said to be unconditionally secure, but in practice, it is difficult for practical devices to meet the requirements, leading to the breakage of the security of practical QKD systems.

2. To combat practical attacks, some counter-measures, including device-independent security proof ideas, have been proposed. One such idea is Measurement Device-Independent QKD (MDIQKD), which removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard QKD.

3. In MDIQKD, neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement, but they only send out quantum signals to a measurement unit (MU). The MU can be a network administrator or a relay, but it can also be untrusted and completely under the control of the eavesdropper (Eve).

4. The basic idea of MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol, which is equivalent to EPR-based QKD in terms of security. MDIQKD is remarkable because it removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard QKD.

5. The security of MDIQKD relies on the assumption that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is almost perfect and carefully characterized. This assumption is easier to satisfy than the characterization of the detection unit.

6. Two phase encoding MDIQKD schemes have been proposed, one based on the phase locking technique and the other based on the conversion of pulses in the standard phase encoding BB84 to polarization modes.

7. The first scheme can cover relatively short distances of key generation, but it has an advantage that the basis-dependent flaw can be controlled by the intensities of the pulses. The second scheme can cover much longer distances when the fidelity of the single-photon components of the density matrices is perfect or extremely close to perfect.

8. The accurate preparation of the state is very important not only in MDIQKD but also in standard QKD, where Eve can enhance the imbalance of the quantum coin exponentially with the increase of the distance.

3. Recent observations have uncovered the environment surrounding massive young stellar objects, with analysis of CO bandhead emission inferring Keplerian disks surrounding four massive young stellar objects.

4. Interferometric mm-continuum observations have found the mass-function of protostellar dust clumps to lie close to a Salpeter value down to clump radii of 2000 AU.

5. High-resolution observations point towards an accretion formation scenario for massive stars, but further discrimination between competing models is possible by examining the properties of hot molecular cores.

6. Class II methanol masers exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally not associated or offset from UCHII regions, indicating that they are a reliable indicator of massive star formation.

7. Observations of three star-forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission have revealed multiple point sources within the cores, with the methanol masers found closest to the brightest mid-infrared (MIR) point source.

8. Monte Carlo simulations have shown that it is difficult to generate the observed mass distributions of the most massive stars from the gas in the core using a standard form of the initial mass function (IMF), suggesting that an alternative formation mechanism may be necessary.

The reconstruction is done using the Noether symmetry approach and the stability of the reconstructed models is analyzed.

4. The paper also discusses the stability of the reconstructed models against linear homogeneous perturbations. The stability analysis is done using the perturbed field equations and the conservation law. The results show that some of the reconstructed models are stable, while others are unstable.

1. Majorana fermions (MFS) are real solutions of the Dirac equation and are their own antiparticles. They have been proposed to occur as quasi-particle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems.

2. MFS obey non-Abelian statistics, which is an important factor in realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.

3. Various platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect.

4. However, observing the unique Majorana signatures experimentally is still a challenging task. MFS are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs).

5. Theoretical predictions of ZBPs have been observed experimentally in semiconductor nanowires, which are interpreted as the signatures of MFS.

6. An alternative all-optical scheme has been proposed to detect MFS using a coupled hybrid quantum dot (QD) - nanomechanical resonator (NR) system with optical pump-probe technology.

7. The QD is modeled as a two-level system, and the NR is modeled as a quantum harmonic oscillator. The coupling between the QD and NR is described by a deformation potential coupling.

8. Theoretical calculations show that the signals in the coherent optical spectra indicate the possible Majorana signature, which provides another supplement for detecting MFS. The NR enhances the detection sensitivity of MFS by narrowing and increasing the exciton resonance spectrum.

1. The first evidence of the violation of time reversal symmetry was found in the kaon system, but despite strong efforts, no other signal of violation has been found to date. However, studying time reversal symmetry has become a cornerstone of the search for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles.

2. Theories beyond the standard model, such as dynamical symmetry breaking, multi-Higgs models, and grand unified theories, imply specific ways of violating time reversal symmetry. These theories are formulated in terms of quarks and leptons, whereas nuclear low-energy tests of time reversal symmetry involve hadronic degrees of freedom.

3. To extract hadronic degrees of freedom from observables, effective nucleon-nucleon potentials or mesonic exchange potentials can be introduced. These potentials have been proven useful in treating the nuclear structure part involved and extracting effective hadronic coupling constants.

4. The purpose of the present paper is to give estimates on hadronic matrix elements that arise when relating quark operators to the effective hadronic parameterizations of the time reversal symmetry-violating interaction. The authors use the constituent quark model to relate quark operators to effective hadronic operators and evaluate the matrix elements of the left-hand side of the equation.

2. A plausible explosion model for SNe Ia is the accreting white dwarf (WD) model, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion star, increases its mass, and then explodes.

3. Researchers have made significant progress in the accreting WD model by introducing the stellar wind from the WD while it accretes material from the companion, which helps sustain a stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.

4. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel, and identifies the companion stars that lead to SNe Ia.

5. Observations have not confirmed the above evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia, which requires the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site. A study identified a G2IV star as the companion of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the SNR.

6. Researchers propose a direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta by observing the absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star, specifically the broad wings of Fe II absorption lines in the ultraviolet (UV) range.

7. However, the method may not be conclusive due to uncertainties in the explosion model, such as the number of ionizing photons emitted from the shocked ejecta, and the possibility that a star other than the companion star may be inside the ejecta.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 7}

1. Quantum entanglement is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured much recent interest due to its essential role in quantum information processing. However, quantifying entanglement in mixed states is less clear, and various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, including the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation.

2. The authors analyze the entanglement dynamics of a cascaded qubit system coupled through the one-way exchange of photons, which produces unconditional entangled states as the steady-state solution to a master equation. They demonstrate that in the special case of resonance, the conditional dynamics exhibit a distinct bimodality, where the approach to the Bell state is only one of two possibilities for the asymptotic evolution.

3. The authors use quantum trajectory theory to provide answers to questions about the entanglement dynamics of the system, including how entanglement develops dynamically and whether additional information can be factored into the description by making measurements on the environment. They show that the system either evolves into a maximally-entangled Bell state without emitting photons or an entangled-state cycle is initiated under which the system switches indefinitely between orthogonal Bell states while emitting a continual stream of photons.

1. The unification scheme of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) explains the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN by angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region.

2. The obscuring dusty medium, known as the ""dust torus,"" is optically and geometrically thick and extends from sub-parsec scales outward to several tens of parsecs or beyond for high-luminosity objects.

3. Observations have shown that Type 1 AGN show significantly more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity, consistent with the picture where the face-on view onto the torus in Type 1 AGN exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer.

4. The study aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared and uses a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars at z=0.

5. The sample comprises 11 quasars and 8 radio galaxies, and the average Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of each type are calculated, showing that the radio galaxies are systematically lower in infrared emission than the quasars.

6. The discrepancy between the two types is largest in the near-IR and flattens out towards longer wavelengths, with the quasars showing infrared emission characteristics expected for a Type 1 AGN and the radio galaxies showing Type 2 emission properties.

7. The study tests the possibility that the anisotropy is due to extinction by a cold dust screen and finds that single extinction laws result in much worse fits than the observed anisotropy.

8. The clumpy torus model is used to test if the observed anisotropy ratio can be explained by the intrinsic anisotropy as predicted in the unification scheme, and the model reproduces the observed type 1/type 2 ratio reasonably well.

9. The study finds that the intrinsic ratio between Type 1 and Type 2 AGN is 1.4 at 15μm, and the anisotropy decreases from a factor of about 20 to 2 at wavelengths 2 to 8μm.

10. The results are consistent with upper limits derived from the X-ray/mid-IR correlation of local Seyfert galaxies and suggest that the torus is clumpy rather than smooth.

1. The paper discusses the security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems, specifically the effect of local oscillator (LO) intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate. The authors propose an attacking scheme exploiting this fluctuation and analyze the security of practical CVQKD implementation under this attack.

2. In practical CVQKD systems, the LO intensity is monitored by splitting a small part with a beam splitter, and pulses with large LO intensity fluctuations are discarded. However, even with such monitoring, the effect of small fluctuations on the secret key rate is not yet clearly understood.

3. The authors analyze the effect of LO intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate for both reverse and direct reconciliation protocols. They find that the fluctuation of LO could compromise the secret keys severely if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.

4. The authors propose a practical LO intensity attack (LOIA) scheme, where Eve intercepts not only the signal beam but also the LO, and replaces the quantum channel between Alice and Bob with her own perfect quantum channel. They demonstrate that Eve can get partial or full secret keys that Alice and Bob hold without being found under this attack.

5. The authors calculate the secret key rate for both reverse and direct reconciliation protocols under LOIA and find that the difference between the pseudosecret key rate with Bob not monitoring LO and the truly secret one is still increasing with the channel transmission becoming smaller.

6. The authors conclude that LO intensity fluctuation opens a loophole for Eve to attack the practical system, especially in the case of communication with low channel transmission or over long distance. They emphasize the importance of monitoring the LO fluctuation carefully and scaling the measurements with instantaneous intensity values of LO.

5. The code also uses two techniques to improve the precision of the computed frequencies: a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation. The variational principle is based on the fact that the frequency approximately satisfies a variational principle, while Richardson extrapolation uses the fact that the difference scheme used by the shooting technique and relaxation technique is of second order.

1. The formation of highly structured HI distribution in gas-rich galaxies, marked by cavities, shells, and supershells, is a significant manifestation of their internal activity. These features have been observed in various spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, and are often associated with starbursts, stellar winds, and supernovae.

2. However, the standard explanations for the supershell phenomenon, such as internal starbursts and infalling gas clouds, face significant difficulties in accounting for the energy requirements and observed properties of the supershells. For example, the energy needed to create the eastern supershell in NGC 3556 would require a star cluster populated by hundreds of thousands of O-type stars.

3. A new model has been proposed, suggesting that the supershells are inflated by radio jets that plow through the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy's disk. This model can account for the energy requirements and observed properties of the supershells, including their symmetry and location at the edges of the galaxy's disk.

4. The proposed model involves the ejection of radio jets during an active nuclear phase in the galaxy's life, which then interact with the ISM and inflate bubbles of hot plasma. These bubbles can expand to large scales, exposing them to velocity shear in the medium and causing them to deform into z-symmetry.

5. The model predicts that the presence of supershells should correlate with the existence of a nonthermal radio halo, and that the jets and supershells may coexist in spirals. However, the model also suggests that the jet phenomenon may not directly account for features that correlate with the star-forming disk, such as some known radio and HI halos, and that an indirect connection may be more likely.

1. The first color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies, including the Draco system, were obtained by Baade in 1961, showing features similar to those of globular clusters. However, the presence of RR Lyrae stars led to the interpretation that dSph galaxies are essentially pure Population II systems.

2. Baade noted that dSph galaxies have characteristics that differentiate them from globular clusters, including extreme red horizontal branches and distinct variable star characteristics. The discovery of carbon stars in dSph galaxies revealed an intermediate-age population.

3. The intermediate-age population in dSph galaxies has been confirmed in the CMDs of several galaxies, including Carina, Fornax, and Leo I. These galaxies show a dominant old stellar population, while others, like Leo I, have a larger fraction of intermediate-age and young population.

4. Leo I is a peculiar galaxy with a well-populated red clump but no evident horizontal branch. This suggests that the first substantial amount of star formation may have been delayed in this galaxy compared to other dSph galaxies.

5. The large galactocentric radial velocity of Leo I (177 km/s) suggests that it may not be bound to the Milky Way, unlike other dSph galaxies. Byrd et al. (1994) suggest that Leo I and the Magellanic Clouds may have left the neighborhood of the Andromeda galaxy about 10 Gyr ago.

6. The CMD of Leo I obtained from new HST data shows a broad range in magnitude in the main sequence turnoff region, indicating a large range in age. The fainter envelope of the subgiants coincides with the position expected for a 10-15 Gyr old population, while the brightest blue stars on the main sequence may be as young as 1 Gyr old.

7. The red clump (RC) in Leo I is densely populated and extended in luminosity, similar to that observed in the general field of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This suggests an extended star formation history with a large intermediate-age component.

8. The metallicity of Leo I is estimated to be low, with a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = 2.02 ± 0.10 dex. However, the width of the RGB can be accounted for by the dispersion in age alone, suggesting that the metallicity dispersion could be negligible.

2. The result can be interpreted intuitively as functions satisfying a certain condition being constant along the flow of the vector field, and the existence of non-trivial first integrals allowing for flow lines that are contained in the domain.

3. The article aims to verify a similar property of the principal eigenvalue when the classical Laplacian is replaced by the fractional Laplacian with a parameter.

4. The main difficulty in the development stems from the roughness of general elements of the Sobolev space and the non-locality of the fractional Laplacian, which prevent a direct application of differential calculus.

5. The authors use conditioning suggested by a paper of Bogdan and Dyda, approximation techniques for flows given by Diperna and Lions, and properties of the Green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of the fractional Laplacian.

6. The main result states that if the domain is a bounded domain with a 1-regular boundary that is simply connected, and the vector field is of zero divergence, then the principal eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian is equal to the infimum of the first integrals.

5. The authors apply VAEs to the Ising model, a well-studied model in physics, and demonstrate that the latent parameter can serve as a good approximation of the order parameter, which is the magnetization in this case.

6. They also show that the reconstruction loss, a measure of how well the VAE can reconstruct the input data from its latent representation, can be used as a universal indicator for phase transitions.

7. The authors extend their analysis to the XY model, a model with continuous symmetries, and demonstrate that the VAE can handle this model equally well as the Ising model.

8. They conclude that VAEs can be a powerful tool for identifying phase transitions and order parameters in physical systems, and suggest that this approach can be applied to other models, such as quantum spin liquids.

The main laws of quantum mechanics prohibit the perfect cloning of quantum states, but it is possible to carry out an approximate copying of the quantum states using quantum cloning machines (QCM). QCM can produce identical or non-identical copies of the initial state, and the quality of the copying can be either identical for all states or depend on the state.

2. The authors discuss a specific type of QCM, known as ""partial"" QCM, which copies only one component of a two-partite pure state. They use a natural criterion to choose the parameters of the QCM, which is to minimize the integral average of the ""distance"" between the initial state and the output state. The authors also discuss the cloning of mixed qubit states by using the ""purification"" of the mixed state and then applying the ""partial"" cloning machine.",1,{'n_points': 2}

The nature of dark matter remains one of the outstanding questions in modern astrophysics, and various models have been proposed to explain its composition, including the possibility of a significant baryonic component. The authors of the paper have used a Monte Carlo simulation code, Geant4, to calculate the gamma-ray spectra arising from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds, which could potentially account for a major component of the dark matter.

2. The results of the calculations show that the predicted gamma-ray spectra differ substantially between high and low column-density clouds, and the authors discuss the interpretation of their results in the context of the observed galactic gamma-ray emission. They also revisit the published constraints on the baryonic contribution to the dark matter halo of the galaxy, taking into account the discrepancy between the model and data at high energies, and find that the existing gamma-ray data do not exclude purely baryonic models for the galactic dark halo.",1,{'n_points': 2}

1. Colloidal suspensions have the potential to develop novel materials through self-assembly, particularly colloidal crystals, which can exhibit iridescent colors and be used to produce photonic crystals.

2. The optical properties of colloidal crystals can be controlled by adjusting the lattice spacing with an external field, making them suitable for applications such as lasers and display devices.

3. The thermodynamic properties of colloidal crystals allow them to be viewed as mesoscopic ""model atoms,"" enabling the study of complex phenomena such as phase transitions and exotic crystal structures.

4. The introduction of a rotating AC field can induce dipolar interactions between colloidal particles, leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures.

5. The use of a rotating AC field allows for the direct observation of phase transitions and the study of long-standing problems in condensed matter, such as freezing.

6. Monte Carlo simulations were used to model the behavior of colloidal particles in a rotating AC field, with the results compared to experimental data.

7. The simulations showed that the lattice constant of the colloidal crystal can be approximated by the minimum of the effective interaction potential, which is a combination of electrostatic repulsions and dipolar attractions.

8. The simulations also showed that the lattice constant is sensitive to the particle size, with smaller particles requiring higher field strengths to form crystalline rafts.

9. The results suggest that the lattice tunability is maximized for particles of approximately 1 to 1.5 microns, with higher field strengths applied to smaller particles increasing the lattice tunability.

10. The methodology used in this study demonstrates the potential of effective colloidal interactions to model complex interactions and engineer materials with tunable properties.

1. Soft X-ray transients (SXRTs) show properties similar to those of persistent low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (LMXBs) when in outburst, but the origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in quiescence is unclear.

2. AQL X-1 is the most active SXRT known, with over 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected, and its companion star has been identified as the K1V variable star V1333 Aql.

3. The outbursts of AQL X-1 are characterized by a fast rise (5-10 days) followed by a slow decay, with a folding time of 3070 days.

4. Type I X-ray bursts were discovered during the declining phase of an outburst, testifying to the presence of a neutron star.

5. The X-ray luminosity of AQL X-1 is in the range of 10^36-10^37 erg/s, and the spectrum is soft with an equivalent bremsstrahlung temperature of 20-30 keV during outburst.

6. During the decay phase, the spectrum changes to a power law with a photon index of 2, extending up to energies of 100 keV, and the equivalent radius of the black body component decreases by a factor of 2.

7. The quiescent state of AQL X-1 is characterized by a soft X-ray spectrum consistent with a black body temperature of 10 keV, and the power law component is absent.

8. The sharp flux decay leading to quiescence is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, but with obvious differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra.

9. The outburst evolution of low-mass X-ray transients presents important differences from dwarf novae outbursts, including a steepening in the X-ray flux decrease and a marked spectral hardening.

10. AQL X-1 likely represents the ""missing link"" between LMXBs and recycled millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and its quiescent X-ray luminosity can be explained by a radio pulsar enshrouded by matter outflowing from the companion star.

1. The supernova SN 2006jc was discovered on October 9, 2006, and was found to be associated with a luminous blue variable (LBV)-like event that occurred in 2004. The supernova was classified as a Type Ib supernova, but its spectra showed unusual features, including a bright blue continuum and a ""U""-like shape in the optical spectra.

2. The bolometric luminosity of SN 2006jc was estimated by integrating the UV, optical, and infrared (IR) photometries, and was found to be dominated by the IR emission, which was attributed to the formation of amorphous carbon dust. The dust temperature was estimated to be around 1500-2000 K, and the luminosity emitted by the hot carbon dust was included in the bolometric luminosity.

3. The presupernova model of the progenitor star of SN 2006jc was extracted from a set of models presented by other authors, and was found to be a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star with a mass of around 25 solar masses. The model showed a thick carbon-rich envelope and circumstellar medium (CSM), which was consistent with the formation of amorphous carbon grains in the SN ejecta and CSM.

4. The explosion model of SN 2006jc was calculated using a spherical Lagrangian hydrodynamics code, and was found to be a hypernova-like explosion with an explosion energy of around 10^52 ergs. The model reproduced the bolometric light curve of SN 2006jc, including the rapid decline of the optical light curve and the brightening of the IR light curve.

5. The CSM interaction model of SN 2006jc was calculated using a 1D hydrodynamics code, and was found to reproduce the X-ray light curve of SN 2006jc. The model showed a flat density distribution in the inner CSM, which was consistent with the LBV-like event that occurred two years before the explosion. The model also showed that the fallback of material onto the central remnant was an important process in the explosion.

1. The micro-quasar GR S 1915+105 is an enigmatic black hole binary (BHB) exhibiting enormous variability, which has been classified into more than 14 different variability classes.

2. The extreme variability and rapid state changes observed in GR S 1915+105 are believed to be due to a very high accretion rate, close to or higher than the Eddington accretion rate.

3. Another BHB, IGR J170913+624, has been detected and has exhibited repeated outbursts with periods of two to four years, with the recent 2011 outburst being unusually long.

4. IGR J170913+624 revealed its highly variable nature and showed variability patterns similar to those observed in GR S 1915+105, including the ""heartbeat"" pattern.

5. The authors used data from RXTE and XMM-Newton to investigate the possible reasons for the apparent faintness of IGR J170913+624, which is about 20 times fainter than GR S 1915+105.

6. The authors simultaneously fitted spectra at different phases, tying system parameters across phases, and found that the faintness of IGR J170913+624 is due to its low or negative spin.

7. The authors used the ""heartbeat"" oscillations as a ""standard candle"" to constrain the parameters of IGR J170913+624, and found that the black hole spin is required to be either very low or negative.

8. The authors also considered the 66 Hz QPO detected by XTE as an independent constraint on black hole mass, but found that it does not provide any constraint on the distance.

9. The authors concluded that the black hole spin may not play a significant role in generating the observed extreme variability, and that such a behavior is generated mainly by a high accretion rate.

1. The extinction curve describes how extinction changes with wavelength, and it is necessary to understand the physical properties of dust grains in the interstellar medium. The Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) law is a mean extinction law that depends on only one parameter, Rv, which ranges from about 2.0 to 5.5.

2. The CCM law is used to determine the extinction in some spectral regions based on the extinction in a different spectral region, given that one knows Rv. The law is very powerful because it allows one to determine the extinction in some spectral region based on the extinction in a different spectral region.

3. The authors extend the method used by Gregory S. (GS) to obtain improved Rv values for the lines of sight toward a sample of stars with known extinction data in the ultraviolet (UV). They use the GS method improved through the consistent treatment of observational errors and compute the Rv and R1 values listed in Table 2.

4. The authors present the sky distribution of Rv values and show their behavior as a function of galactic coordinates. They also discuss the systematic errors in extinction curve determination that can result from using biased color excesses to Rv ratio. The authors find that the Rv values change with different calibrations of Rv, and they emphasize the importance of considering various sources of statistical and systematic errors in the determination of Rv values.

1. A quantum computer can perform certain algorithms much faster than classical computers, such as the Shor algorithm for factorizing numbers. The basic elements of quantum computation are qubits and quantum logical gates, which can be constructed to create any circuit for quantum algorithms.

2. The qubit state can be encoded using an electron charge or electron spin, with spin qubits being characterized by longer decoherence times necessary for quantum computation. However, preparing a spin qubit requires applying a magnetic field and removing degeneracy between spin up and down.

3. The manipulation of qubits can be done by electron spin resonance and read-out via currents in spin-polarized leads. Another concept for encoding qubits is based on singlet-triplet states in a double quantum dot (DQD), which does not require a magnetic field and can be prepared by electrical control of exchange interactions.

4. Researchers have proposed building qubits in more complex systems, such as three coherently coupled quantum dots (TQD), which can be controlled by exchange interactions and have a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) that is immune to decoherence processes.

5. The TQD system has been experimentally realized, and studies have shown that it can be used to perform coherent spin manipulations, initialization, and decoherence of qubit states. The read-out of qubit states can be performed using the Pauli blockade effect.

6. A new method for read-out of qubit states has been proposed, which is based on current measurement in the doublet blockade regime. This method is compatible with pure electrical manipulations and does not require spin-to-charge conversion.

7. The dynamics of the qubit has been studied in the presence of decoherence processes caused by interaction with the electrodes, including leakage processes from the doublet to two-electron states and spin-flip processes in the electrodes. The results show that the qubit conserves its spin coherence for a time needed for a read-out process, making it promising for manipulation and read-out of the qubit.

2. The 1984-1986 outburst of Z And is characterized by two maxima in the visual magnitude profile, leading to an ambiguous interpretation of the outburst as a double or a disturbed single one.

3. The brightness of the 1984-1986 event was exceptionally low, but it was monitored at very close dates by spectral observations, allowing for a detailed modeling of the physical conditions in the nebulae.

4. The stellar wind of the cool giant has a velocity of 25 km/s, and varying the wind velocity from 25 to 30 changes the accretion regime from disk to wind accretion, accompanied by a jump in the accretion rate and hydrogen burning rate.

5. The collision of the winds leads to two shock fronts between the stars, with the strong shock propagating in reverse towards the white dwarf (WD) and the weakest shock propagating towards the red giant (RG).

6. The detailed modeling of the spectra reveals that the 1984-1986 outburst is characterized by a sudden increase of the density and velocity, indicating collision of the WD wind with a shell ejected from the RG.

7. The ionization parameter drops by more than two orders of magnitude after June 1985, accompanied by the simultaneous variation of the dynamical parameters and magnetic field, suggesting that the shock front has suddenly shifted farther from the WD.

8. The gas composition at the epochs of collision with the shells reveals that the calculated SiIII/SiIV line ratios would better reproduce the data adopting Si/H relative abundances lower than solar by a factor of 4 for some models.

3. The junction resistance between nanotubes is much larger than the nanotube resistance itself, leading to the behavior of a system with randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport.

4. The study investigates the frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks with systematically varying densities, which is essential for understanding their electrical transport properties.

5. The results show that the onset frequency extracted from the frequency dependence measurement increases with the film thickness, while the length scale extracted from the electric field-dependent measurement decreases at the same time.

6. An empirical relation is developed between the two transport measurement methods, which is essential for understanding the electrical transport properties of SWCNT networks.

7. The study also investigates the scaling behavior of the conductance and frequency for SWCNT networks, which shows a universal relationship between onset frequency and dc conductance.

2. The phase-field method describes the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields, which obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods.

3. However, the method has limitations, particularly in the thin-interface limit, where the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale present in the problem.

4. In this limit, the phase-field model can exhibit two independent thin-interface effects: one proportional to the interface velocity and the other proportional to the current crossing the interface.

5. The first effect, known as trapping, arises from the heat generated at the rear of the interface getting trapped when the diffusivity decreases upon solidification.

6. The second effect, known as Kapitza resistance, arises from the surface thermal resistance at the interface, which can be decomposed into three elementary steps: transport in one bulk phase, crossing of the interface, and transport in the other phase.

7. Orientation-field models, which describe the orientation of a crystal using a single scalar quantity, have been developed to simplify the phase-field method. However, these models have limitations, particularly in their evolution equation for the angle field, which does not correctly describe the microscopic evolution of the orientation field.

8. The inclusion of fluctuations in the phase-field equations can also lead to renormalization of the free energy, which can affect the accuracy of the simulations. This is particularly important in the continuum limit, where the sum in the equation for the free energy diverges.

2. The authors of the paper have developed a new method, called nlte-opt, to determine the atmospheric parameters of FGK stars. This method uses the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

3. The nlte-opt method consists of two parts: the first part determines the optimal effective temperature estimate for each star, and the second part uses the same iterative techniques as the LTE-FE method to compute the surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulence.

4. The authors have tested the nlte-opt method on a sample of metal-poor stars from the RAVE survey and compared the results with those obtained using the widely-used LTE-FE method. The comparison shows significant systematic biases in the LTE-FE method, particularly at low metallicity.

5. The nlte-opt method provides more accurate estimates of effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, which is essential for determining other fundamental stellar parameters such as mass, age, and distance through comparison to stellar evolution models.

1. The effects of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure have been detected in several samples of high-redshift QSOs, intermediate-redshift galaxies, and BATSE GRBs. The detection of weak lensing in these samples is significant, as it provides a new way to study the distribution of mass in the universe.

2. In the case of point sources, weak lensing manifests itself as angular (anti-)correlations between these sources and foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass. In the case of galaxies, weak lensing is detected through its coherent shear effect.

3. Another way to detect weak lensing is by using fluxes of standard candles, such as supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia). By correcting the observed magnitudes of SNe Ia for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen, with brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess and fainter sources having mass deficits in their foregrounds.

4. The authors use a sample of 55 SNe Ia from the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team to study the effects of weak lensing on the distribution of SNe Ia. They find a significant correlation between the observed magnitudes of SNe Ia and the number density of foreground galaxies.

5. The correlation is found to be significant at a confidence level of 99.80%, and the slope of the best-fit line to the correlation is -0.3. The authors conclude that the correlation is likely due to weak gravitational lensing, which would amplify SNe Ia found behind more nearby mass concentrations.

6. The authors also consider the possibility that the correlation is due to galactic dust obscuration, which would make SNe Ia sources brighter and apm galaxies more numerous in the directions devoid of galactic dust. However, they find that this interpretation is unlikely, as the observed rms in the number density of foreground galaxies is too small to explain the correlation.

7. The authors use a simple lensing model to study the effects of weak lensing on the distribution of SNe Ia. They find that the model can reproduce the observed correlation, but only if the optical depth of the matter traced by the galaxies is within a certain range.

3. The low-temperature state of HF metals is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened spins, which crosses over to incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering at higher temperatures.

4. Theoretical treatments of HF metals center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) and its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model, but exact results are lacking, spurring the search for suitable approximation schemes.

5. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a framework that has had a major impact in recent years, providing a formally exact solution in the large-dimensional limit, but it does not provide a method to solve the PAM.

6. The local moment approach (LMA) is a method that has been employed to solve the PAM, which introduces the physically intuitive notion of local moments from the outset and leads to a ""two-self-energy"" description.

2. The study of DNA loop formation has been advanced by single-molecule experiment techniques, which have provided detailed information on the process. Recent experiments have shown that static and temporally fluctuating tensions play a crucial role in regulating DNA loop formation.

3. Theoretical studies have been conducted to understand the effects of tension on DNA loop formation, including the development of a transfer matrix method to calculate semiflexible polymer end-to-end distance distribution function and loop formation probability. However, there appears to be no unifying conceptual or theoretical framework that explains a variety of experiments.

4. Brownian dynamics simulations have been performed to study the effects of static and fluctuating tensions on semiflexible polymer looping. The results show that a minute tension as small as 100 fN can dramatically change the looping time, especially for long chains, and that the looping time has a resonant minimum at an optimum flipping time.

5. The study suggests that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally utilizing the ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations, and further experiments using dichotomically fluctuating tension with various flipping times are called for to establish the resonant activation phenomena in polymer loop formation.

Researchers have proposed a new method to measure the distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light. This method involves measuring the intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by the two sources and can provide information about the relative distance between the sources in the range of 10-500 nm.

The method relies on the relationship between the temporal fluctuations of the total power emitted by two incoherent sources and the cross-density of states (cdos) connecting the source points in an arbitrary environment. The cdos is a two-point quantity that encodes the distance between the sources, and its fluctuations can be accessed from measurements of the directional intensity, providing an alternative to the two-point field-field correlation technique for green's function retrieval.

2. The GWLC model describes the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal viscous solvent. The authors introduce a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable characterizing the network of thermo-reversible sticky bonds, which is updated dynamically upon bond breaking according to an appropriate rate equation.

3. The model predicts a pronounced fluidization response, which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers. The yield force for the onset of the fluidization is sensitive to the deformation rate, and the fluidization response is accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake-down effect.

4. The authors also discuss the importance of prestressing force in adhering cells, which is correlated with a higher stiffness of adhering cells and the substrate. They propose that the cell actively adapts its structure to maintain a certain set of thermodynamic state variables in a physiologically sensible range, a concept known as homeostasis.

5. The extended model integrates experimentally confirmed features of the viscoelastic response, such as slow relaxation, power-law rheology, viscoelastic hysteresis, and shear stiffening, with a simple bond kinetics scheme, allowing for complex nonlinear physical remodelling effects like fluidization and inelastic shake-down to be addressed.

1. Topological insulators are materials that preserve time-reversal symmetry and have non-trivial topological invariants, characterized by robust surface metallic states. They are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and contain heavy or rare metal elements.

2. Researchers have proposed that an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase, known as a topological Mott insulator (TMI).

3. However, the stability of the TMI phase is hampered by competing symmetry breakings, such as charge-density-wave (CDW) instabilities, and the emergence of the TMI requires the Coulomb repulsion between next-nearest neighbor sites.

4. To clarify the competitions among TMIs and CDWs, researchers have employed functional renormalization group methods, but these methods are not suitable for capturing first-order thermal or quantum phase transitions.

5. A reliable limit where the TMI becomes stable is when the Coulomb repulsion is infinitesimally small, and the quadratic band crossing with vanishing Fermi velocities causes the leading instability toward the TMI.

6. Researchers have found that by reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones, the TMI tends to be stabilized, and by using a variational Monte Carlo method, they have shown that the TMI emerges in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking.

7. The researchers have also proposed that twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) offers Dirac electrons with tunable Fermi velocities, and by choosing stacking procedures, the quadratic band crossing, or zero Fermi velocity limit, can be achieved, which has been observed in experiments.

8. The estimated single-particle excitation gap induced by the TMI is up to 0.1 eV, which is substantially larger than the room temperature, and the theoretical results support that topological insulators with such a large excitation gap are possibly obtained by using abundant carbon atoms.

1. Researchers have discovered that the naturally occurring tilt boundaries in gated multi-layer graphene support topological gapless edge states, which are protected by three symmetries: time (valley) reversal, no-valley-mixing, and electron number conservation. These edge states are predicted to be robust against long-range perturbations and can be used to explain the observed sub-gap transport in graphene devices.

2. The researchers used a combination of tight-binding model calculations and first-principles calculations to demonstrate the existence of gapless edge states at the tilt boundaries. They also applied the framework of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to classify the different topological phases of gated multi-layer graphene, including the QVH, QAH, LA, and QSH phases.

3. The researchers propose that the naturally occurring tilt boundary network in graphene devices can be used to control the sub-gap transport and enable device applications of gated multi-layer graphene systems. They suggest that the tilt boundary network can be used to create a 2D variable range hopping temperature dependence, which can be tested through proposed transport, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and thermopower imaging experiments.

1. The text discusses the properties of charged macromolecules, specifically polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes, which are ionizable polymers that dissociate into charged macromolecules and counterions when dissolved in a polar solvent. These macromolecules have various industrial and medical applications, and their behavior is influenced by electrostatic interactions and excluded volume effects.

2. The text focuses on the properties of polyampholyte brushes, which are formed by grafted diblock polyampholytes. The behavior of these brushes is influenced by the sequence of charged monomers, the fraction and sequence of charged monomers, and the bending energy of the chains. The text presents a scaling analysis to describe the linear dependence of the brush thickness on the grafting density for flexible diblock polyampholytes.

3. The text presents the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of planar brushes of flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike diblock polyampholytes. The simulations show that the average brush thickness linearly depends on the grafting density, regardless of the chains' different flexibility. The histograms of equilibrium conformations of the brushes show that the conformations of the brushes of semiflexible and rodlike chains change noticeably with changing the grafting density.

4. The text discusses the main differences between brushes of polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte chains, which originate from opposite trends of inter- and intra-chain electrostatic interactions and different rules of counterions' osmotic pressure in these brushes. The results of the simulations and theoretical analysis show that linear dependence of the average thickness on the grafting density is also the case in the brush of polyampholyte chains, and the amount of flexibility of the chains controls the strength of excluded volume effects and inter-chain correlations.

1. The article discusses the study of nonet scalar mesons as tetraquark states using new QCD sum rules, where the scalar diquarks are taken as point particles and described as basic quantum fields. The numerical values obtained are compatible with experimental data and theoretical estimations, and the diquark currents have the advantage of satisfying the two criteria of QCD sum rules more easily.

2. The study also takes into account the contributions of intermediate pseudoscalar meson loops to the correlation function, and the finite widths of the scalar mesons are considered to obtain modified masses. The results show that the modified masses are better compared to the experimental data, and the scalar tetraquark currents may also have non-vanishing couplings with higher resonances, which are supposed to be glueballs.

1. The source document discusses the importance of power system dynamic analysis using the ime-domain simulation approach, which involves solving differential and algebraic equations (DAEs) to represent the dynamics of a power system. However, this approach can be computationally expensive due to the large number of DAEs involved.

2. To accelerate the simulation, researchers have proposed various methods, including using a larger time step size or implementing a quasi-steady-state (QSS) model. However, the QSS model suffers from numerical difficulties when the model gets close to singularities.

3. The pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method is a theoretical-based numerical method that can be used to accelerate the simulation of power system long-term stability analysis. This method can be implemented directly in the long-term stability model or in the QSS model to overcome numerical difficulties.

4. The PTC method has a better stability property compared to conventional integration methods, which can converge, diverge, or stagnate at a point where the iteration matrix is singular. The PTC method can accept an increase in the residual and respond by decreasing the step size.

5. The PTC method can be applied to the long-term stability model and the QSS model to achieve fast simulation speed and overcome numerical difficulties. The method has been implemented in the long-term stability model and the QSS model, and numerical examples have shown that it can provide correct stability assessment and good accuracy for intermediate trajectories.

6. The PTC method can be regarded as a good in-between method with respect to integration and steady-state calculation, making it an alternative method in power system long-term stability analysis. The method has been supported by the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.

1. The problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2D) has attracted increasing interest due to the potential to create exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. Recent experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has opened up ways to realize these phenomena, and unique opportunities for modeling 2D effects in a highly controlled environment have appeared with the development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2D Bose and Fermi ultracold gases.

2. A method for quantitative analysis of 2D quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer has been developed, which permits the description of 2D collisions of unpolarized dipoles. The method is based on the Fourier basis for the angular-grid representation of the searched wave function, and it has been applied to the 2D scattering on the cylindrical potential with the elliptical base and the 2D dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles, showing high efficiency in all problems considered.

1. The supernova remnant G65.2+0.5 was initially studied in the 1980s but was later ignored until recent observations revealed its unique characteristics.

2. G65.2+0.5 is classified as a thermal composite supernova remnant, which is a rare type of remnant that exhibits a combination of shell-like radio continuum morphology and centrally bright X-ray morphology.

3. The thermal composite morphology is thought to be due to various processes, including radiative phase evolution, thermal conduction, and collisions with molecular clouds.

4. The remnant's age has been estimated to be around 23,000 years, making it one of the oldest known thermal composite supernova remnants.

5. Optical observations of G65.2+0.5 have revealed that it has entered the shell formation phase, with a shell-like radio continuum morphology and thermal X-ray emission.

6. Archival ROSAT data have been used to map the remnant and confirm that the emitting gas is extended and fills the remnant's outline, lacking a bright shell and exhibiting a slowly decreasing temperature gradient.

7. Spectral models have been used to analyze the X-ray emission from G65.2+0.5, revealing a temperature range of 2.5 to 3.5 keV and a column density range of 10^21 to 10^22 cm^-2.

8. The remnant's luminosity has been estimated to be around 10^34 erg/s, with an electron density of around 0.1 cm^-3, which is lower than that of other thermal composite supernova remnants.

9. The possibility of a supernova remnant-cloud interaction has been suggested, but a targeted search for CO emission features outlining the remnant has been inconclusive due to confusion with galactic material.

The paper discusses the relation between adaptive sorting algorithms and compression techniques on permutations, showing that some concepts originally defined for adaptive sorting algorithms, such as runs and shuffled upsequences, are useful in terms of the compression of permutations. The authors present several encoding schemes for permutations, including one that uses at most 136 bits to encode a permutation with a set of runs, and another that uses at most 177 bits to encode a permutation covered by shuffled upsequences.

2. The paper also discusses the application of these encoding schemes to various scenarios, such as the encoding of integer functions, text indexes, and binary relations. The authors show that their encoding schemes can be used to support operations such as permutation sorting, inverse permutation, and text retrieval in small time, and that they can be combined with other data structures to support additional operations. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of these encoding schemes for improving the efficiency of various algorithms and data structures.

The researchers identify various types of chimera states, including mixed oscillatory states (MOS) where desynchronized neurons are interspersed among those that are either stationary or oscillate in synchrony. They also observe the emergence of chimera states in the 3D Hindmarsh-Rose model, which exhibits a rich variety of bifurcation scenarios.

2. The study highlights the significance of nonlocal coupling in the occurrence of chimera states and its relevance to neuroscience applications. The researchers note that chimera states are strongly related to synchronization phenomena and that the human brain is an excellent example of a complex system where nonlocal connectivity is compatible with reality. The study also verifies the existence of chimera states in coupled bistable elements, which was previously known to arise in oscillator models possessing a single attracting state of the limit cycle type.

1. Kauffman networks are disordered dynamical systems proposed by Stuart Kauffman in 1969 as a model for genetic regulatory systems. They attracted the interest of physicists in the 1980s due to their analogy with disordered systems studied in statistical mechanics. The networks exhibit a dynamical phase transition, and their properties can be studied using the annealed approximation, which is exact in the infinite size limit.

2. The study of Kauffman networks has led to the identification of stable and relevant elements, which are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the system. Stable elements are those that evolve to a constant state, independent of the initial configuration, while relevant elements are those that can influence the long-time behavior of the system. The number of relevant elements is found to scale as the square root of the system size in the chaotic phase and as the system size on the critical line.

3. The distribution of the magnetization, which is a measure of the activity of elements in the network, has been studied in finite systems. The results show that the asymptotic value of the magnetization is reached after a time that decreases with system size, and the corrections to the infinite size values are very large. These finite size effects are due to the periodic dynamics of the random networks and can be accounted for by taking into account the existence of limit cycles in the framework of the annealed approximation.

1. Researchers studied turbulence in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and found that both the superflow kinetic energy and the spin-dependent interaction energy exhibit power-law spectra, specifically the Kolmogorov spectrum (−5/3 power law) and the 1 power law, respectively.

2. The study used the spin-1 spinor Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations to model the system and introduced a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation term to prevent energy accumulation in the high-wave-number region. Numerical calculations confirmed the appearance of the power-law spectra in the superflow kinetic energy and the spin-dependent interaction energy.

3. The researchers found that the Kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy is generated by the nonlinear spin term, and the 1 power law in the spin-dependent interaction energy is independent of the relative velocity. They also discussed the possibility of inverse energy cascade in the spin-dependent interaction energy, but the direction of energy cascade is not yet fully understood.

1. Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) reside in about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and occupy the majority of the population of AGNs. Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes.

2. The accretion model of optically-thin discs, such as the Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF), is often used to explain the low luminosities of LLAGNs. This model predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of LLAGNs.

3. Observations of LLAGNs have been carried out exclusively at centimetre bands, where high sensitivities are available, due to their faint radio sources. However, this has prevented the detection of the ADAF's inverted spectrum.

4. A high-frequency observation is promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF, as it is less affected by non-thermal jets and the ADAF predicts larger flux densities at higher frequencies.

5. The authors conducted a millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for 20 LLAGNs using the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). They found that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz.

6. The authors confirm little diffuse contamination in the NMA measurements from dust, free-free, and extended non-thermal emissions for LLAGNs showing inverted spectra. Therefore, the inverted spectra are not caused by resolution effects, but intrinsic properties of the cores.

7. The authors find an inverse correlation between the high-frequency radio spectrum and the low-frequency radio core power, which can be explained by the idea that flux ratios between the jet showing steep spectrum and the ADAF disc showing inverted spectrum are different from LLagn to LLagn.

1. The scattering, absorption, and reradiation of photons by dust grains affect the propagation of starlight and play a key role in regulating the energy balance in the interstellar medium. Studies of these processes have provided a great deal of insight into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains.

2. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law, also known as the reddening law.

3. The ratio of total to selective extinction, R_V, is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law, and studies have found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope R_V.

4. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, and significant deviations from the canonical R_V value of 3.1 have been observed in various interstellar dust clouds, which appear to be generally correlated with environment.

5. The authors propose three methods for measuring the R_V value of dust in the foreground of differentially reddened globular clusters, which rely on accurate three-band optical photometry of cluster stars, two-band optical photometry, and a map of the dust thermal emission.

6. The authors apply these methods to the globular cluster NGC 4833, which has variable extinction across its face, and use simulated cluster data sets to fine-tune and test the methods.

7. The results from the three methods are combined to give a mean extinction law slope of 2.7 for the line of sight towards NGC 4833, and the scatter in the cluster HB is used to estimate the amount of small-scale structure in the dust complex in the foreground of the cluster.

8. The small-scale power spectrum derived from cluster optical data matches smoothly onto the larger-scale power spectrum derived from the SFD reddening map of the region, and the overall power spectrum is well-fit by a power law with an index of 2.3.

1. The heavy fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of distinctive energy scales, including the Kondo scale, which marks the screening of local magnetic moments, and the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which indirectly couples the local moments via the magnetic polarization of the conduction electrons.

2. The Kondo lattice model (KLM) is used to study the heavy fermion systems, which describes an array of localized magnetic moments coupled antiferromagnetically to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons. The model is solved using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) approach, which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the Kondo effect.

3. The DCA results show that the Kondo lattice model exhibits a rich phase diagram, including a paramagnetic phase, an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase, and a quantum critical point (QCP). The single-particle spectral function is calculated across the magnetic transitions and in the magnetically ordered phases, and it is found to be in excellent agreement with lattice QMC results.

4. The DCA+QMC approach allows for the study of the evolution of the Fermi surface across the magnetic order-disorder transition, which is found to be continuous and associated with the backfolding of the large heavy fermion Fermi surface. Within the AF metallic phase, a Fermi surface topology change is observed from hole pockets centered around the zone center to one centered around the zone boundary.

5. The transition in the Fermi surface topology is found to correspond to two continuous Lifshitz transitions, and it is adiabatically connected to one where the localized spins are frozen and Kondo screening is completely absent. The energy scales required to resolve the nature of this transition are presently orders of magnitude smaller than accessible within the DCA with a quantum Monte Carlo solver.

6. The DCA+QMC results are confirmed by mean-field modeling of the quantum Monte Carlo results, which shows that the transition in the Fermi surface topology corresponds to two continuous Lifshitz transitions. The results are also consistent with previous variational quantum Monte Carlo calculations and Gutzwiller approximation calculations, but they do not support the idea of an orbital-selective Mott transition or Kondo breakdown.

They analyze the spectra of two white dwarfs, BPM 27606 and Procyon B, and find that the observed wavelengths of the molecular C3 Swan bands are consistent with the laboratory measurements, but with a small uncertainty. This allows them to set upper bounds on the Higgs-Kreschmann coupling, which is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the strength of the coupling between the Higgs field and spacetime curvature.

2. The authors find that the upper bounds on the Higgs-Kreschmann coupling are of the order of 10^-14 to 10^-13, which is comparable to the bounds set by the LHC experiments. They also note that this method is complementary to the LHC experiments and can be used to search for couplings between generic scalar fields and spacetime curvature. The authors suggest that future improvements to this method could include measurements and calculations of pressure shifts of C I lines and the C3 Swan bands under white dwarf conditions, as well as observations of ultraviolet carbon and other metal lines.

Theoretical models predict multiple unstable hydrogen-burning episodes, which may not be consistent with the observed pulsations in elm WDs. Further empirical exploration of the elm WD instability strip is necessary to constrain physical and evolution models of elm WDs.

1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into distinct phases, including hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium, with star formation restricted to cold dense gas. The molecular gas content is a crucial tracer of star-forming regions, but its presence is not causal to star formation.

2. The atomic-to-molecular transition in the ISM is a complex process influenced by various energetic stellar feedback mechanisms, and understanding this process is essential for simulating galaxy evolution. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, known as photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively, but their structure is dynamic and non-linear.

3. The simulations of the ISM have attempted to replicate a supernova-driven ISM, finding success in reproducing a multiphase ISM and demonstrating the regulation of the star formation rate by stellar feedback. However, studies that have examined the atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale, three-dimensional simulations have received less attention.

4. The authors of this paper aim to perform a detailed study on the chemical state of gas in a self-consistently simulated ISM, focusing on accurately computing the molecular content with a rigorous treatment of the generation and attenuation of photodissociating far-UV (FUV) radiation. They use a post-processing approach, applying multifrequency ray tracing to the supernovae-driven galactic disk simulations of K15, and compare the results with various local approximations for radiative shielding.

1. The authors of the paper argue that the vertical extension of the red clump (VRC) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is due to stellar evolution, specifically the blue loops experienced by intermediate-mass stars in their helium-core burning phase, rather than an intervening population of stars.

2. The authors use a combination of observational data and theoretical models to demonstrate that the VRC can be explained by the presence of intermediate-mass stars in the LMC that are currently undergoing core helium burning. They also show that the relative density of stars in the VRC is consistent with a stellar evolutionary origin.

3. The authors conclude that stellar evolution can account for the observed stellar density in the VRC, and that a slightly steeper initial mass function (IMF) slope, as preferred by many recent LMC studies, can reproduce the observed VRC stellar density exactly. They argue that no foreground population need be invoked to explain the presence of the VRC in the LMC.

1. The study investigates the relationship between star formation and cluster mass in 69 local galaxy clusters using data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The results show that the mean specific star formation rate (mssfr) of cluster galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center, but remains below the field value even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.

2. The study finds that the fraction of star-forming galaxies (demi-LIRGs) is suppressed at large radii, with more than one third of the star-forming galaxies residing at 2-3 times the virial radius. This suppression is consistent with previous studies and may be due to galaxies being pre-processed in intermediate-density environments or the contribution of a ""backsplash"" population beyond the virial radius.

3. The study investigates the impact of cluster mass on star formation by presenting the total cluster star formation rate normalized by mass (cssfr) as a function of cluster mass. The results show no significant correlation between cssfr and cluster mass, indicating that mechanisms that scale strongly with cluster mass, such as ram pressure or harassment, are not likely to play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters.

4. The study suggests that strangulation, a process where a galaxy's hot halo gas is removed as it enters the cluster intracluster medium, may be a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies. This process is less dependent on cluster mass than ram pressure or harassment and can occur in low-mass groups.

5. The study uses a sample of 69 local galaxy clusters and finds a total of 109 star-forming demi-LIRGs with sfr > 4.6 M_sun/yr within 3 times the virial radius. The results are consistent with previous studies and provide further evidence for the suppression of star formation in cluster environments.

6. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution and the role of cluster environments in regulating star formation. The results suggest that cluster mechanisms that scale with cluster mass are not dominant in the evolution of star formation in local clusters, and that strangulation may be an important process for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies.

1. The Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (BPP) is a concept in functional analysis that deals with the density of norm-attaining functionals in the dual space of a Banach space. A functional is said to attain its norm if there exists a point in the domain space where the functional attains its norm.

2. The Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás theorem states that every bounded linear functional can be approximated by norm-attaining functionals, but this result does not hold for bounded linear operators. Lindenstrauss proved in 1963 that there exists a Banach space where the set of norm-attaining operators is not dense in the space of all bounded linear operators.

3. The Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property for operators (BPPo) is a generalization of the BPP for functionals. A pair of Banach spaces (X, Y) is said to have the BPPo if given a bounded linear operator T from X to Y and a point x in the unit sphere of X, there exists a point y in the unit sphere of Y such that ||Tx - Ty|| = ||x||.

4. The strong Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (SBPP) is a stronger version of the BPPo. A pair of Banach spaces (X, Y) is said to have the SBPP if given a bounded linear operator T from X to Y and a point x in the unit sphere of X, there exists a point y in the unit sphere of Y such that ||Tx - Ty|| = ||x|| and the operator T attains its norm at y.

5. The uniform strong Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (USBPP) is a version of the SBPP where the constant that appears in the definition depends only on the norm of the operator and not on the operator itself.

6. The paper studies the SBPP and USBPP for pairs of Banach spaces and provides several examples of pairs that satisfy or fail these properties. The authors also provide a characterization of the SBPP for pairs of Banach spaces.

7. The paper concludes by noting that the SBPP and USBPP are related to the density of norm-attaining operators in the space of all bounded linear operators and that the study of these properties can provide insights into the structure of Banach spaces.

2. A growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by the neutrino collaborations, with the only 2p-2h model implemented up to date being the IFIC Valencia model.

3. One of the main problems in implementing 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor.

4. A fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG) has been developed, known as the frozen nucleon approximation, which reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1.

5. The frozen nucleon approximation assumes that the initial momenta of the two struck nucleons can be neglected for high enough energy and momentum transfer, allowing for a significant reduction in computational time.

6. The validity of the frozen approximation has been investigated by including the electroweak meson-exchange current (MEC) model, which requires the introduction of a ""frozen"" propagator for the Δ resonance.

7. The frozen approximation has been found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission and has been validated by comparing with exact results in the RFG.

8. The frozen approximation enables the efficient and rapid calculation of 2p-2h responses, allowing for the modification of model parameters inside the codes, and has been found to be valid for a range of momentum transfers from low to high values.

The accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the nucleus of galaxies is believed to be the source of activity in quasars and Seyfert galaxies, also known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Studies have suggested that the mass of the SMBH is correlated with the luminosity, mass, and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the galaxies.

2. One independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique, which involves measuring the time lag between the variations of the continuum emission and the broad emission lines. This technique has been used to make estimates of SMBH masses over a large range of redshift.

3. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to study the dependence of the various observed phenomena of AGNs on the black hole mass and the cosmic evolution of the black holes. However, the technique is observationally taxing, and to date, the BLR radius of only about three dozen AGNs (Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars) have been determined.

2. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in forming the line shape, particularly in determining the position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc.

3. The innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value, and the spin affects the overall shape of the line.

4. The LAOR model, a widely used relativistic disc spectral line model, has been improved by allowing the dimensionless angular momentum to be fitted in the suite of KY models.

5. The LAOR model can still be used for evaluating the spin if the inner edge of the disc is identified with the marginally stable orbit, and the spin is estimated from the lower boundary of the broad line.

6. The authors compared the LAOR model with the KY model on two sources, MCg-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit extremely skewed iron lines, and found that the KY model leads to a better-defined minimum for the best-fit value of the spin.

7. The discrepancies between the LAOR and KY model results are within the general uncertainties of the spin determination using the skewed line profile, but the results are distinguishable for higher-quality data, such as those simulated for the XEUS mission.

8. The authors also found that the correct re-binning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution is crucial to obtain statistically relevant results.

1. The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method is used to generate axially symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations corresponding to disk-like configurations of matter, which can be used as models of galaxies or accretion disks.

2. These solutions can be static or stationary and with or without radial pressure, and can be used to study the properties of disks with and without halos.

3. The method involves displacing a compact source of gravitational field, cutting it, and reflecting the remaining space to create a disk with a singularity that is a delta function with support on the disk.

4. The Einstein field equations will separate into two different pieces: one valid for the usual Einstein's equations, and another involving distributions with an associated energy-momentum tensor with support on the disk.

5. The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method is applied to the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates to generate a disk with surface energy density and radial and azimuthal pressures given by specific equations.

6. The total mass of the disk can be calculated using the Einstein equations, and the surface energy density is always positive, satisfying the weak energy condition.

7. The strong energy condition is also satisfied, and the velocity of sound propagation is calculated using the Einstein equations and the pressure equation.

8. The tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion is calculated by assuming a test particle moves in a circular geodesic on the disk, and the stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is studied using an extension of Rayleigh's criteria of stability.

9. The method is applied to various solutions of the Einstein equations for static spheres of perfect fluid, including the Buchdahl solution and the Narlikar-Patwardhan-Vaidya (NPV) solutions, to generate disks with halos and study their properties.

1. The existence of a domain wall solution in a system of two interpenetrating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with a coupling drive has been shown. The relative phase between the two condensates changes by π as one travels through the wall, and the wall solution is formally similar to the kink in the sine-Gordon field theory. However, the domain wall is not topologically stable and can decay.

2. The decay rate of the domain wall due to thermal fluctuation has been estimated, and it is found to be exponentially suppressed. The crossover temperature, below which crossover proceeds via quantum tunneling rather than via thermal activation, is estimated to be of the order of a few nanokelvin, given typical parameters of present-day experiments.

1. Anomalies in field theory occur when a symmetry of the action or the corresponding conservation law, valid in the classical theory, is violated in the quantized version. This phenomenon was discovered by Adler, Bell, and Jackiw in 1969 and plays a fundamental role in physics.

2. The breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous for the consistency of the theory, but the breakdown of an internal symmetry (gauge symmetry) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory, destroying the renormalizability and unitarity of the theory.

3. The gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, were first found within perturbation theory and are local polynomials in the connection and curvature. They can be calculated using various methods, including the heat kernel method, Fujikawa's path integral approach, and modern mathematical techniques.

4. The dispersion relation approach is a less familiar but useful method for calculating anomalies. It involves expressing the amplitude in terms of dispersion relations, which relate the real part of the amplitude to its imaginary part. The imaginary parts of the amplitude can be easily calculated via Cutkosky's rule.

5. The authors have calculated the gravitational anomalies using the dispersion relation approach and have found that the anomalous Ward identity and the anomalous trace identity depend only on the finite formfactor t1. They have also determined the linearized gravitational anomalies, including the linearized Einstein and Weyl anomalies, and their covariant versions.

6. The origin of the anomaly is the existence of a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of the formfactor t1, which approaches a δ-function singularity at zero momentum squared in the zero mass limit. This is an independent and complementary view of the anomalies as compared to the ultraviolet regularization procedures.

7. The dispersion relation approach is equivalent to the n-dimensional regularization procedure of 't Hooft and Veltman, and the two approaches are linked by the substitutions. The authors have also calculated the gravitational Schwinger terms, which occur in the energy-momentum tensor, and have found that they are determined by the formfactor t1, which shows the same infrared feature as the anomalies.

1. The Space Time Explorer & Quantum Equivalence Space Test (STE-QUEST) is a medium-sized mission candidate for launch in 2022/2024 in the Cosmic Vision program of the European Space Agency (ESA).

2. The mission aims to study the cornerstones of Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) by pushing the limits of measurement accuracy by several orders of magnitude compared to what is currently achievable in ground-based experiments.

3. The STE-QUEST mission consists of two primary science objectives: to measure the gravitational red-shift experienced by highly accurate clocks in the gravitational fields of Earth or Sun, and to test the universality of free fall using differential accelerations of microscopic quantum particles.

4. The mission will use two instruments: an atomic clock and an atom interferometer, which will be used to measure the gravitational red-shift and test the weak equivalence principle, respectively.

5. The atomic clock is a rebuilt version of the high-precision PHARAO clock used in the Aces mission, with the additional provision of an optically derived microwave signal for superb short-term stability.

6. The atom interferometer uses interference between matter waves to generate an interference pattern that depends on the external forces acting on the atoms under test, and will be used to test the weak equivalence principle.

7. The STE-QUEST spacecraft will have a highly elliptical orbit with a perigee altitude of 700 km and an apogee altitude of 50,000 km, which will maximize gravity gradients between apogee and perigee.

8. The spacecraft will have a total wet mass of approximately 2300 kg, including unit maturity margins and a 20% system margin, and will be designed to be compatible with all requirements for launch with a Soyuz-Fregat from the main ESA spaceport in Kourou.

9. The mission assessment activities have yielded a spacecraft and mission design that is compliant with the challenging demands made by the payload on performance and resources, but several critical issues have been identified, including low maturity of certain payload components and high sensitivity of the optical links to atmospheric distortions.

1. Pulsed high-frequency (HF) electromagnetic waves from transmitters on the ground are used to study the density profile and drift velocity of the ionosphere. Theoretical studies have shown that weak-turbulence parametric instabilities can be excited in the ionospheric plasma if the injected HF radio beams are strong enough.

2. Ionospheric modification experiments have demonstrated the heating of electrons, deformation in ionosonde records, and excitation of spread F, among other effects, after the HF transmitter was turned on. The triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere was first observed in 1970 in experiments conducted at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.

3. Numerical simulations have become an essential tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence. Examples include analytical and numerical studies of Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas.

4. A full-scale simulation study of the propagation of an HF EM wave into the ionosphere was conducted, using ionospheric parameters typical for the high-latitude EISCAT heating facility in Troms, Norway. The results suggest that such simulations will become a powerful tool to study HF-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level.

5. The simulation showed that the EM pulse propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer. The initially linearly polarized EM wave undergoes Faraday rotation due to the different dispersion properties of the L-O and R-X modes in the magnetized plasma.

6. The simulation also showed the mode conversion of the L-O mode into electrostatic Langmuir/upper hybrid waves, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation of the high-frequency waves. Second harmonic generation has been observed in ionospheric heating experiments and may be partially explained by the cold plasma model presented in the study.

1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid Mott-insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recent experiments with cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice have rekindled interest in this model and triggered theoretical and experimental activity.

2. The Mott-insulator transition is driven by the interplay of repulsive interaction between bosons on the same lattice site and kinetic energy. The ratio of onsite energy and bandwidth is a key parameter in the system, which can be easily controlled and varied in optical lattices.

3. The authors use perturbation theory to study the short-range correlations not included by the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz. They derive corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix, which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns.

4. The results show that the inclusion of short-range correlations leads to distinct modifications in the expansion patterns, including a broad peak in the Mott-insulator regime and a suppression of the superfluid peak. The authors also study the effects of a harmonic confinement potential, which leads to situations where superfluid and Mott-insulator regions coexist.

5. The authors compare their results with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and find good qualitative agreement in some cases, but also considerable discrepancies in situations with a large Mott-insulator fraction. They attribute these discrepancies to the insufficiency of the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz and low-order perturbation theory in describing long-range correlations in inhomogeneous situations.

1. The paper discusses the classification and visualization of homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in multi-scalar models with an arbitrary scalar potential. It develops a geometrical method that involves augmenting the target space to a larger space of lorentzian signature, where the logarithm of the scale factor plays the role of time.

2. The paper shows that flat cosmologies are null geodesics in the augmented target space when the potential is positive, and timelike or spacelike geodesics when the potential is negative. For non-flat cosmologies, the target space is further enlarged to a doubly-augmented target space, where geodesics yield cosmological trajectories for any spatial curvature.

3. The paper also discusses the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies in models with rather general potentials, showing that the late-time behavior can be determined by comparison with the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies in models with exponential potentials. It also presents a complete treatment of cosmological trajectories for simple exponential potentials, which correspond to trajectories of an autonomous dynamical system in a phase space parametrized by the time-derivatives of the scale factor and scalar fields.

1. The authors discovered a faint and red star, LSPM J2322+7847, which is a candidate nearby low-mass dwarf, located at an angular separation of 5 arcseconds from the active and rapidly rotating G9V star HIP 115147.

2. The authors obtained new photometry of HIP 115147, its known visual companion HIP 115147B, and LSPM J2322+7847, and obtained preliminary trigonometric parallax astrometry for the latter companion.

3. The authors discuss the possible young age and origin of the interesting triple system, and suggest that HIP 115147 is a very young, naked ""post-T Tauri dwarf"" with a space velocity similar to the local young stream.

4. The authors estimate the age of HIP 115147 to be around 20-50 million years based on its X-ray luminosity, chromospheric activity, and lithium surface content, but note that the lithium surface content is a poor estimator of age for young stars.

5. The authors use model isochrones to estimate the age of HIP 115147 and its companions, and find that the Siess et al. 50 Myr isochrone provides the best fit for all three alleged comoving components.

6. However, the authors note that the 16 Myr isochrone from the same model matches the position of the extremely active dwarf PZ Tel, which is likely a member of the Pic associations estimated to be 12-20 Myr old, suggesting that HIP 115147 and its companions are probably older than 16 Myr.

7. The authors conclude that the currently available evidence is consistent with LSPM J2322+7847 being one of the youngest, later-type stars in the near solar neighborhood, but note that more accurate absolute proper motions and spectroscopic radial velocities are required to clarify the dynamical status of the system.

1. The universe's flatness and the dominance of dark energy, which causes cosmic acceleration, have been supported by various cosmological observations. To understand the origin of dark energy, researchers have explored its connection with particle physics, particularly in the context of the dynamical model proposed by Fardon, Nelson, and Weiner (MAVANS).

2. In the MAVANS model, relic neutrinos could form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration. An unknown scalar field, called the ""acceleron,"" is introduced, and neutrinos are assumed to interact through a new scalar force. The acceleron sits at the instantaneous minimum of its potential, and the cosmic expansion modulates this minimum through changes in the neutrino density.

3. The neutrino mass is given by the acceleron, meaning it depends on its number density and changes with the evolution of the universe. The equation of state parameter and dark energy density also evolve with the neutrino mass, depending on the model of the scalar potential and the relation between the acceleron and the neutrino mass.

4. A supersymmetric MAVANS model is presented, including the effects of supersymmetry breaking mediated by gravity. The model assumes a chiral superfield in the dark sector, whose scalar component causes the present cosmic acceleration, and the right-handed neutrino superfield.

5. In the supersymmetric MAVANS model, two types of models are considered: the case of vanishing mixing between the left-handed and sterile neutrino, and the finite mixing case. In the vanishing mixing case, only the mass of the sterile neutrino varies on cosmological time scales.

6. The model with vanishing mixing is found to be hydrodynamically stable and can act as dark energy, as the speed of sound squared in the neutrino-acceleron fluid is positive. The mass of the sterile neutrino varies slowly in the present epoch, and the model can avoid the instability of the speed of sound.

7. In the finite mixing case, the mass of the left-handed neutrino also varies, but the variation is extremely small, and the effect of the mixing does not almost affect the evolution of the sterile neutrino mass and the equation of state. This model can also avoid the instability and is consistent with the limit provided by analyses from WMAP three-year data.

The QGP can be created in the early universe, at the core of super-dense stars, or in the initial stage of relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions in heavy ion accelerators.

2. The paper discusses the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of the QGP using the one-gluon exchange interaction in the framework of the Landau Fermi liquid theory. The results show that the QGP internal and free energies are much larger than those of strange quark matter, and the one-gluon exchange interaction facilitates the quarks transition to the deconfined phase at lower density.

1. A conformally symmetric model was proposed for strong interactions at low energies, based on the observation by H. Weyl in 1919 that the dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form when subject to a conformally-flat metrical field.

2. The model describes quarks and gluons as confined to an anti-de-Sitter (ADS) universe with a finite radius in flat space-time, while photons freely travel through flat space-time.

3. The fields in the model comprise one real scalar field and one complex scalar field, whose dynamical equations were solved for a particular solution that leads to ADS confinement.

4. The model was further simplified to allow for interactions between hadrons, and the ADS spectrum was coupled to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products.

5. The ADS spectrum reveals itself through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions, but there is no simple relation between enhancements in experimental cross sections and the ADS spectrum.

6. Empirical evidence suggests that an ADS oscillation frequency of 190 MeV agrees well with the observed results for meson-meson scattering and meson-pair production in various flavor sectors.

7. The average radius for quark-pair creation in quarkonia was found to be described by a flavor-independent mass scale, which was used to estimate the mass of the scalar field associated with confinement.

8. Experimental evidence for the possible existence of a quantum with a mass of about 38 MeV was presented, which is related to the mechanism of quark-pair creation and has scalar properties.

9. The light scalar glueball, which is a mini-universe filled with glue, is a perfect candidate for the quantum associated with the scalar field for confinement, and its mass is estimated to be around 38 MeV.

10. The data suggest the existence of two replicas of the 38 MeV boson with masses that are two and three times heavier than the 38 MeV boson, and the authors urge the BABAR collaboration to inspect their larger data set to settle the possible existence of the 38 MeV boson and the related hybrid spectrum.

1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the early 1980s in the study of periodic advance of glaciers on Earth, and it refers to the effect of non-monotone dependence of the response of a system on noise when this noise is added to a periodic input signal.

2. Stochastic resonance is the phenomenon in which the transmission of a signal can be improved by the addition of noise, and it has been observed in various fields of applications, including physics, biology, and finance.

3. The problem of estimating a signal transmitted through a channel can be solved by adding noise to the signal, and the optimal level of noise is called stochastic resonance. The criterion applied to measure the optimality of estimators are the Shannon mutual information or the Kullback divergence.

4. The paper studies the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model in which a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal are added with a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process. Two schemes of observations are proposed: observing only the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.

5. The asymptotic properties of estimators for the two schemes are established, and it is shown that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators. The phenomenon of stochastic resonance is observed in the model, and it is shown that the overall probability of error is non-monotonically dependent on the noise level.

6. The paper also studies a problem of testing two simple hypotheses for the model discussed in the previous section, and it is shown that the decision rules for our model are similar to the one proposed by Chapeau-Blondeau in the i.i.d. setting.

7. The use of ergodic diffusions as noise in the problem of stochastic resonance seems quite powerful, and characterizations of classes of ergodic processes that enhance the stochastic resonance can be done, but not in a simple way as in the i.i.d. case.

1. The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) has been found to have mainly a d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-wave gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature, and minor components smaller than 5% of that with the d-wave symmetry.

2. Thermal transport measurements have shown the predominance of this symmetry for the gap function, and the fourfold oscillation in the thermal conductivity can be explained by both Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles.

3. The thermal conductivity measurements in two single crystals of YBCO have been performed in the presence of a planar magnetic field, and the results show fourfold oscillations below 15 K, which can be well reproduced by a model involving Andreev scattering and the two-dimensional BRT expression for the thermal conductivity, assuming a d-wave pairing.

4. The overall results agree with the d-wave pairing symmetry of the order parameter, and the small differences found in the angle patterns between the twinned and untwinned samples can be explained in terms of the different impurity concentration and oxygen deficiency.

The authors study purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere, which are Dehn surgeries along a knot with distinct slopes that result in the same oriented manifold.

2. The authors show that for most knots in the three-sphere, purely cosmetic surgeries do not exist, and they provide a sufficient condition for a knot to admit no purely cosmetic surgery in terms of its Jones polynomial. Specifically, if a knot has either a non-zero second derivative or a non-zero third derivative of its Jones polynomial evaluated at a certain point, then it does not admit purely cosmetic surgeries.

3. The authors also study the case of two-bridge knots and whitehead doubles, and they prove that these knots do not admit purely cosmetic surgeries under certain conditions. They derive an explicit formula for the finite type invariant of order 3 for two-bridge knots in Conway form and use it to study the cosmetic surgery problem for these knots.

4. The authors apply their results to the cosmetic surgery conjecture, which states that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic. They show that the conjecture is true for all knots with no more than 10 crossings, except possibly for a few examples.

5. The authors also discuss the connection between their results and other known results on the cosmetic surgery conjecture, and they provide a new example of a knot that does not admit purely cosmetic surgeries, which is a genus two knot with a certain property.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties, including calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor-invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariance. However, these models suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, leading to tachyonic states.

2. To solve this problem, the original solution is to suppose that scalars acquire a universal mass, which when added to the AMSB soft terms, renders them positive. This leads to the parameter space of the ""minimal"" AMSB model (MAMSB) being given by m_0, m_3/2, m_13, and sign(m_13).

3. An alternative setup for AMSB has been advocated, known as hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMS), which uses a similar setup as the one envisioned for AMSB. In HCAMS, supersymmetry breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, geometrically separated from the visible region where the MSSM resides.

4. The HCAMS model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons and features relatively heavy squarks, while pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms and features relatively heavy sleptons. However, the combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.

5. The HCAMS model has been implemented in the ISASUGRA subprogram of the event generator ISAJET v7.79, and the resulting superparticle mass spectrum is typically in close accord with other sparticle spectrum generators. The model predicts a reach of the LHC for HCAMS models assuming 100 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity, with a reach to 10.5 TeV (corresponding to 2.2 TeV) for low values of the dimensionless quantity @xmath2, and a reach to 14 TeV (corresponding to 3.5 TeV) for large @xmath2 values.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 5}

1. The zero-range potential (ZRP) approach is a method used to widen the limits of traditional treatment in quantum mechanics, allowing for the possibility of obtaining an exact solution of the scattering problem. This approach can be represented as a boundary condition on the matrix wavefunction at some point or as a pseudopotential.

2. The Darboux transformation (DT) is a technique used to construct exactly solvable potentials and can be applied to the ZRP model to correct it. The DT modifies the generalized ZRP (GZRP) boundary condition and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.

3. The DT can be used to add or remove poles of the matrix, which correspond to quasi-stationary states (resonances). The principal observation allows for the construction of a zero-range potential eigenfunction in the multi-center problem. The DT can also be used to dress the ZRP model, introducing a short-range core of centrifugal type in the potential.

4. The ZRP model can be applied to multi-center scattering problems, such as the scattering of electrons by polyatomic molecules. The DT can be used to correct the ZRP model at low energies, and the results can be compared to experimental data and numerical calculations.

Researchers have developed several numerical schemes to solve the convection-diffusion equation, including finite element method, lattice Boltzmann method, finite-difference scheme, and higher-order compact finite difference schemes. A nine-point high-order compact implicit scheme proposed by Noye and Tan is third-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time.

2. The authors determine 15 spectroscopic redshifts, of which they consider 10 to be secure, and find a median redshift of 2.14 for the full spectroscopic sample. This is consistent with the redshift distribution determined by Chapman et al. (2005) for a larger sample.

3. The authors conclude that the bright SMG population is readily amenable to study via radio-selected samples, down to a 850-μm flux density limit of 3.16 Jy. However, they note that the dual-wavelength extraction performed here could potentially bias the sample against very-high-redshift sources that would only be detected at 1.2 mm.

4. The authors re-calibrate the rule-of-thumb relationship between positional accuracy, beam size, and significance, and find that the most secure SMGs, at 3σ, representative of those expected in upcoming, confusion-limited, wide-field (tens of square degrees) 0.85-mm surveys using SCUBA-2, will be located with an uncertainty of 10 arcsec, at which level the precision of the telescope pointing and SCUBA-2 flat-field may become important contributors to the positional error budget.

1. The authors present a study of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) in the local universe and its evolution with redshift, using data from the Norris survey of the Corona Borealis supercluster. They find that the lf of local field galaxies agrees well with the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS) when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields, but the normalization of their local lf is roughly a factor of 1.6 higher than that of the Stromlo/APM survey.

2. The authors observe evolution of the field galaxy lf within their sample, confirming the conclusions drawn from several previous redshift surveys. The evolution is limited to the population of blue, star-forming galaxies, which becomes more luminous with increasing redshift, and thus the median color of the field galaxy population does not change.

3. The authors find that the star formation is long-lived, and they do not see evidence for short-term bursts of star formation. They also do not detect any evolution of the population of galaxies with weak [OII] emission. The lfs of the two superclusters show significant differences from the field galaxy lf, despite considerable overall similarity.

4. The authors suggest that the most prominent difference is an excess of very bright galaxies (M < -20.5) relative to the best-fitting Schechter function, which accurately describes the field lf over the observed absolute magnitude range. These very bright galaxies are found in very dense regions of the superclusters and have spectra dominated by an old, red stellar population.

5. The authors conclude that the fundamental physical processes which drive galaxy formation and evolution must not depend strongly on environment, but there are important differences between the lfs in the field and in the superclusters that must ultimately be due to environmental effects. They also note that a CCD-based local redshift survey will certainly resolve any remaining questions about the local lf.

1. Rapidity gaps, or pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA collider and the Fermilab Tevatron. These gaps are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons.

2. The two-gluon exchange model, which is the simplest model for color singlet exchange, predicts a gap fraction of order one percent, which is consistent with the observed data.

3. However, the two-gluon exchange model has limitations, and the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative. Unitarity constraints must be taken into account to obtain a more realistic description.

4. The unitarized two-gluon exchange model, which includes unitarity constraints, predicts a gap fraction that depends on the regularization parameters. This dependence is strong enough to encompass both scenarios predicted by the two-gluon exchange model and statistical models of color rearrangement.

5. The data from the D0 and CDF collaborations at the Tevatron are consistent with the unitarized two-gluon exchange model, but the data are not yet precise enough to unambiguously distinguish between different scenarios.

6. The unitarized two-gluon exchange model is capable of fitting the present Tevatron data, but the variation of the predictions with model parameters highlights the limitations of a perturbative approach to the color singlet exchange probability.

7. The formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence, and its ubiquity asks for a theoretical explanation within QCD. The unitarized gluon exchange amplitudes show some intriguing features, including a universal phase that absorbs all non-perturbative effects.

8. The unitarized gluon exchange model suggests a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data, via the gap survival probability and the universal phase. This analysis goes beyond the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of rapidity gap fractions and should be performed directly by the experimental collaborations.

Load forecasting is also used for system security purposes, providing expedient information for detecting vulnerabilities in advance.

The forecasting of energy consumption within a particular geographical area depends on several factors, including historical load, mean atmospheric temperature, mean relative humidity, population, and GDP per capita. The Gaza Strip has experienced rapid growth in energy demand, with about 75% of demands coming from service and household sectors.

3. Various algorithms have been proposed to tackle the electric energy consumption forecasting problem, including time series approach, functional based approach, and soft computing based approach. The time series approach is characterized by prediction inaccuracies and numerical instability, while the functional based approach uses a functional relationship between a load dependent variable (usually weather) and the system load.

4. The soft computing based approach, which includes techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and artificial neural networks (ANN), is a more intelligent approach that is extensively being used for demand side management. The ANN approach is based on examining the relationship between input and output variables and has been used to forecast regional load, short-term electricity prices, and electricity market prices.

5. The paper presents an ANN model to forecast electric energy consumption in the Gaza Strip, using historical monthly data from years 1994 to 2013. The model was trained and tested using 2-fold and k-fold cross-validation techniques, and the results show good accuracy and relevance of the proposed ANN approach in forecasting electric energy consumption.

1. Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries consisting of a compact object and a low-mass star, where the secondary star transfers mass via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk around the compact object.

2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z-sources and Atoll sources, based on their X-ray color-color diagrams and accretion rates.

3. Z-sources are the brightest LMXBs, with mass accretion rates reaching the Eddington limit, while Atoll sources have lower accretion rates and fragmented island-like regions in their color-color diagrams.

4. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z-source, indicating it is a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit.

5. The system parameters of LMCX-2 are not well constrained, with estimates for the orbital period ranging from 6.4 hours to 12 days, and no periodic variability detected in 6 years of MACHO data.

6. The authors used phase-resolved spectroscopy to detect narrow emission lines in the Bowen region, which are thought to arise from the irradiated surface of the donor star.

7. The radial velocity curve of the He II emission line shows a periodic variability, which is interpreted as the orbital period, and is similar to the photometric period detected by Callanan et al. (1990).

8. The authors created Doppler maps of the He II and Bowen regions, which show a ring-like structure, but with some minor differences between the two nights of observations.

9. The system parameters of LMCX-2 are constrained by assuming that the narrow emission lines arise from the donor star, and using the relation between the mass ratio and the fractional period excess of the spectroscopic and photometric periods.

10. The constraints on the system parameters are not very tight, but suggest that LMCX-2 likely harbors a massive neutron star, with a mass function of at least 1.16 solar masses, and a mass ratio of at least 0.10.

1. The axial anomaly in quantum field theory can be interpreted as an infrared phenomenon, which is complementary to the more familiar ultraviolet interpretation. This interpretation is based on the dispersive approach, which shows that the anomaly is related to the chiral limit and can be derived without using the renormalization procedure. The axial anomaly can be related to the presence of a singularity in the chiral limit in the absorptive part of the triangular diagram, which leads to a non-conservation of helicity.

2. The axial anomaly can be observed in helicity-changing processes, such as the radiative pion decay and the radiative Z boson decay, where a lepton changes its helicity by emitting a photon. The decay rates for these processes do not vanish in the chiral limit, due to a term independent of the lepton mass, which is interpreted as a manifestation of the axial anomaly. The cancellation of mass singularities in these processes occurs through a mechanism different from the usual one of real and virtual compensation, and is controlled by the anomalous breaking of the chiral symmetry.

1. The paper discusses the problem of salient object detection, which involves identifying the most important object in a scene, and proposes a new approach to tackle this challenge.

2. The authors argue that current salient object detection models have focused on scenes with single objects and have not been tested on complex scenes with multiple objects.

3. They propose a two-stage approach to salient object detection, involving selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.

4. The authors also discuss the importance of benchmark datasets for evaluating salient object detection models and propose a new dataset, called Bruce-A, which includes explicit saliency judgments and eye movements.

5. They analyze the relationship between explicit saliency judgments and free-viewing fixations and find that they agree with each other, suggesting that explicit saliency judgments can be used as a proxy for free-viewing fixations.

6. The authors also propose a simple baseline salient object detection model that involves computing a saliency map and an over-segmented region map, and then thresholding the saliency map to select the most salient object.

7. They compare their model to 8 state-of-the-art salient object detection models and find that it performs well on the Bruce-A and Judd-A datasets, but poorly on the MSRA-5K dataset.

8. The authors analyze the reasons for the performance drop of their model on the Judd-A dataset and find that it is due to the model segmenting the wrong object as the most salient one.

9. They conclude that their model can be used as a baseline for salient object detection and that future research should focus on improving the model's ability to segment the correct object as the most salient one.

1. The paper discusses the construction of a decorated topological quantum field theory (tqft) in 3 dimensions, called Heegaard Floer theory, by Ozsváth, Szabó, and others. The theory involves counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces.

2. The Heegaard Floer homology groups decompose as a direct sum over 2-structures on the 3-manifold, and the maps induced by the triple Heegaard diagram are defined by counting holomorphic triangles in the symmetric product.

3. A multi-pointed triple Heegaard diagram is called ""nice"" if every unpunctured elementary domain is a bigon, triangle, or rectangle. The paper shows that for a nice triple Heegaard diagram, the counts of holomorphic triangles in the symmetric product are combinatorial.

4. The paper also discusses the construction of a nice triple Heegaard diagram for a cobordism between two 3-manifolds, which involves adding a gamma curve to each beta curve and then stabilizing the diagram.

5. The paper reviews the definitions of the Heegaard Floer maps induced by one- and three-handle additions, and shows that the cobordism maps extend to maps under the action of the group.

6. The paper also discusses the action of the group on the hat Heegaard Floer invariants, and shows that the action is trivial on the torsion 2-structure on a 3-manifold.

7. The paper explains how to compute the ranks of the maps induced by two-handle additions, which involves decomposing the cobordism into a sequence of one-handle additions, two-handle additions, and three-handle additions.

8. The paper concludes by explaining how to turn the Heegaard Floer theory into a fully combinatorial tqft, which involves establishing naturality and removing the assumption on the maps on the cobordism.

2. The authors use a method developed by Shrestha to establish that obstructions are cocycles in a family of pasting diagrams sufficient to imply the result in general. They also make explicit a point overlooked in the statements and proofs of theorems 8.2 and 8.3, which is that the cochain maps constructed in those theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions in the pasting diagram.

3. The authors use a polygonal method developed by Shrestha to show that all obstructions are cocycles, provided that the deformation theory is polygonizable and certain conditions are satisfied. They also provide a list of specific pasting diagrams for which the result has been established, including composition-free pasting diagrams, triangles, and solid tetrahedra.

1. The main goal of physics is not only to calculate observable quantities but also to understand the underlying physical picture responsible for a given phenomenon. This requires selecting the essential degrees of freedom from the fundamental ones.

2. In the case of crystals, the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions in the lattice, electrons, and the electromagnetic field. However, to understand electric conductivity and heat capacity, it is more effective to work with ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interactions.

3. A similar situation occurs in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where the full nonquenched QCD on the lattice becomes too complicated at the scale of 1 GeV. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important QCD phenomenon in this case.

4. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry gives rise to the appearance of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass, which represent the associated approximate Goldstone bosons. Valence quarks acquire a dynamical mass, known as constituent quarks.

5. The constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles whose dynamical mass comes from the nonperturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing. The flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit tells that the constituent quarks and Goldstone bosons should be coupled with the strength g, which is a quark analog of the Goldberger-Treiman relation.

6. The chiral interaction between constituent quarks is explicitly flavor-dependent, which allows for the solution of the long-standing problem of ordering of the lowest positive-negative parity states. The chiral interaction reduces the SU(6) symmetry down to SU(3) symmetry, which implies a splitting between the octet and decuplet baryons.

7. The chiral constituent quark model involves a total of 4 free parameters, which are determined from the fit to all 35 confirmed low-lying states. The model achieves a unified description of both nonstrange and strange baryon spectra in good agreement with phenomenology.

8. The short-range repulsion in the nn system is connected with the nucleon structure in the low-energy regime and within the quark picture should be related to the fermi-nature of constituent quarks and to the specific interactions between them. The same short-range part of chiral interaction that causes hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy also induces a short-range repulsion in the nn system.

2. The anti-lock braking system includes a master cylinder, a front wheel brake, and an anti-lock control unit interposed in the brake line between the master cylinder and the front wheel brake.

3. The anti-lock control unit senses the nearly-locked condition of a front wheel and shuts off the hydraulic pressure to the brake itself.

4. However, the existing anti-lock braking system causes the chassis to vibrate when the front wheel brake is applied, especially in motorcycles with high centers of gravity and short wheel bases.

5. The vibration occurs in a vertical direction with the repeated operation of the anti-lock control unit which rapidly cycles the brake on and off under conditions of approaching wheel lock.

6. The reaction of the front fork responsive to the action of braking and of the anti-lock braking device is to begin to dive, resulting in a short period of time where there is no increase of the front wheel load on the tire contact with the ground.

7. The present invention provides an anti-dive device that is responsive to the brake force applied to the front wheel, which can be achieved by tapping hydraulic pressure downstream of the anti-lock control unit or by sensing and applying the actual reaction to braking force of the front wheel.

8. The anti-dive device is provided on the front wheel-supporting front fork, which controls the contracting action of the telescopic front fork in accordance with an operation of the front wheel brake.

9. The anti-dive device suppresses the contracting action of the front fork, which quickly increases the grounding load on the front wheel every time the hydraulic braking pressure for the front wheel brake is increased by an anti-lock control unit.

10. This suppresses vertical vibration of the chassis, facilitates front wheel braking, minimizes variations in the angular deceleration of the front wheel, and improves braking efficiency.

The mounting link includes a female link, a male link, and a pin that selectively retains the links and allows them to translate relative to each other.

2. The female link receives the male link to form a radial interface that dampens the translation of the male link relative to the female link. The pin can be designed to shear at a known load magnitude corresponding to the maximum structural capability of the gearbox assembly, the unfused mount components, and the engine mounting structure.

5. The width of the area from which the metal alloy layer has been removed is preferably between 0.2 and 2.2 mm, and the width of the area from which the metal layer has been removed can be produced by partly eliminating the metal alloy layer on at least one precoated face of the plate by brushing or by means of a laser beam.

6. The invention also provides a method that includes the steps of coating a steel plate to obtain a precoat including an intermetallic alloy layer topped by a metal alloy layer and, then, on at least one face of the plate, removing the metal alloy layer in an area at the periphery of the plate.

7. The method of the invention also includes heating the welded blank to form a surface alloying treatment and austenizing of the base steel, followed by hot deformation of the blank to its final shape as a part.

3. The use of a Ge buffer layer between high-dielectric oxides and Si or metal reduces the reactivity at the surface and enhances the epitaxy, at least reducing the reaction layer between the deposited oxide and the substrate.

4. A thin layer of SrTiO3 or other stable ferroelectric can be used as a buffer layer between the Pb containing ferroelectric and the Ge coated Si substrate to prevent Pb diffusion and form a perovskite structure.

5. The Ge buffer layer allows many stable ferroelectrics, such as BaTiO3, to be used in a RAM, and a second buffer layer of SrTiO3 or some other stable ferroelectric can be used to allow even most chemically reactive ferroelectric oxides to be used.

6. The use of a second germanium layer between the ferroelectric material and the top electrode allows the usage of a wider variety of conductors for the top electrode and allows higher temperature processing during and after the deposition of the top electrode.

1. The current surface transportation programs in the United States do not effectively address the nation's transportation challenges, and a well-defined vision of the national interest and federal role is lacking. The programs are not linked to performance, and most highway, transit, and safety funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs.

2. The federal role in surface transportation has expanded over the years to include broader goals, more programs, and various program structures, but the programs often do not employ the best tools or approaches to ensure effective investment decisions. Rigorous economic analysis does not generally drive the investment decisions of state and local governments.

3. The solvency of the federal surface transportation program is at risk due to expenditures exceeding revenues for the Highway Trust Fund, and projections indicate that the balance of the Highway Trust Fund will soon be exhausted. The rate of expenditures has affected its fiscal sustainability.

4. To address the nation's transportation challenges, a fundamental reexamination of the federal approach to surface transportation problems and a restructuring of federal programs to create more focused, performance-based, and sustainable programs are needed. This could involve shifting policies and programs incrementally or on a pilot basis to gain practical lessons for a coherent, sustainable, and effective national program and funding structure.

5. Various funding and financing options can be used to address projected transportation funding shortfalls, including altering existing or introducing new funding approaches, employing various financing mechanisms, and using public-private partnerships. These options have different merits and challenges, and the selection of any of them will likely involve trade-offs among different policy goals.

6. The principles identified for restructuring the surface transportation programs can be used as a framework for considering levels of investment and the funding and financing options, including creating well-defined goals based on identified areas of national interest, establishing and clearly defining the federal role in achieving each goal, incorporating performance and accountability into funding decisions, employing the best tools and approaches to improve results and emphasize return on investment, and ensuring fiscal sustainability.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engages in three primary activities: aviation safety oversight, air traffic control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development. The costs associated with these activities depend on the nature and usage of the specific service provided, and are primarily driven by the volume of each activity.

2. The FAA's funding structure is based on a combination of user fees and general fund appropriations, with the majority of revenue coming from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is funded by excise taxes on airline tickets, fuel, and cargo. However, this funding structure has raised concerns about revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency.

3. Alternative funding options for the FAA have been proposed, including modifying the current excise tax structure, adopting direct user charges, and using debt financing for capital projects. Some options, such as weight/distance charges and en-route charges, have the potential to improve revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency, but would require significant administrative and transition efforts.

4. The use of debt financing for FAA capital projects has both advantages and disadvantages, including providing a stable source of revenue and allowing costs to be repaid as benefits are received, but also raising concerns about encumbering future resources and the potential for increased borrowing costs due to the federal government's long-term fiscal imbalance.

SSA's disclosure policy is more restrictive than the Privacy Act and the disclosure policies of most federal agencies, and it requires SSA officials to consider several factors before releasing individuals' personal information to law enforcement, including the nature of the alleged criminal activity and the information being requested.

5. SSA officials have expressed concerns about expanding its disclosure policy, citing the need to protect individuals' personal information and maintain the pledge of confidentiality, but the agency has agreed to take steps to eliminate confusion about its policy and provide law enforcement with information on its disclosure policy and procedures.

1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976, amended in 1984, aims to minimize threats to human health and the environment by regulating the management of hazardous waste from generation to disposal.

2. RCRA's requirements, including land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements, can create disincentives for industry to clean up contaminated sites, increasing costs and time for cleanups.

3. The three most significant requirements under RCRA that add cost and time to cleanups are land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits, which can lead parties to choose less aggressive remedies or leave waste in place.

4. The land disposal restrictions and minimum technological requirements can be costly and complex to implement, particularly for cleanups involving large volumes of waste, and may drive parties to use more stringent and costly cleanup technologies than necessary.

5. EPA has proposed alternative policies to mitigate the impact of RCRA's requirements, including the ""contained-in"" policy, permit waivers, and variances from land disposal treatment standards, but these alternatives have been inconsistently applied and have not solved all the problems posed by RCRA's requirements.

6. Comprehensive reform of RCRA's requirements for managing remediation waste can best be achieved through legislation, and EPA recommends that the Administrator take steps to ensure that regulators overseeing cleanups have a more consistent understanding of how to apply EPA's existing policy and regulatory alternatives to RCRA's requirements.

1. The Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) was established in 1997 to support Medicare program integrity activities, and it has undergone significant changes since its inception. Initially, MIP funding was constrained, but the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provided dedicated funding for program integrity activities, which increased from $430 million in 1997 to $720 million in 2003. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005 increased the maximum MIP funding to $832 million for fiscal year 2006.

2. The MIP funds are allocated to five program integrity activities: audit, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, and provider education. The allocation of funds among these activities has varied over time, with audit and medical review receiving the largest amounts of funds overall, and provider education receiving the largest percentage increase in funds. However, the effectiveness of these activities in ensuring program integrity has not been consistently evaluated, and CMS has not routinely collected information to assess their comparative effectiveness.

3. To address the challenges of allocating MIP funds effectively, CMS is developing new measures to evaluate the relative effectiveness of its program integrity activities and contractors' workloads and risk. The agency is also planning to increase its use of award payments to encourage superior performance of program integrity activities by contractors. However, the usefulness of award payments as a tool to encourage contractors to conduct program integrity tasks effectively depends on how well CMS can develop and consistently apply performance measures to gauge differences in the quality of performance.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 3}

1. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been concerned about the performance of passenger and checked baggage screeners in detecting threat objects at the nation's airports, with a long-standing concern dating back to 1978 when screeners failed to detect 13 percent of potentially dangerous objects.

2. In 1987, screeners did not detect 20 percent of objects in similar tests, and in the late 1990s, screeners' abilities to detect dangerous objects declined further.

3. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was signed into law in 2001, creating TSA as an agency responsible for securing all modes of transportation, including aviation, and overseeing security operations at the nation's commercial airports.

4. TSA has taken steps to enhance screener training, including developing a basic screener training program, requiring remedial training, and implementing an Online Learning Center with self-guided training courses.

5. However, TSA has faced challenges in providing access to recurrent training, including insufficient staffing and a lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at some training facilities.

6. TSA has also struggled to establish clear policies and procedures for monitoring the completion of training, including documenting completion of remedial training, and has not established performance targets for the various components of the screening indexes.

7. The agency has made progress in measuring the performance of passenger screeners, but has collected limited performance data related to its checked baggage screening operations.

8. TSA plans to use data from the Threat Image Projection (TIP) system to improve the effectiveness of the passenger screening system, but has not yet implemented TIP for checked baggage screening.

9. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security direct the Assistant Secretary, Transportation Security Administration, to develop a plan to prioritize and schedule the deployment of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity to all TSA's airport training facilities and to develop internal controls to monitor and document the completion of required training.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) operates a network of 25 call sites across the country, employing nearly 10,000 customer service representatives, to provide round-the-clock service to taxpayers. The IRS' call center network is controlled by the Operations Center, which is responsible for forecasting call demand, planning call routing, and developing staffing requirements for each call site.

2. The IRS faces challenges in determining the staffing level for its toll-free telephone customer service operations, as it has not established a long-term, desired level-of-telephone-service goal based on the needs of taxpayers and the costs and benefits of meeting them. This approach is inconsistent with federal guidance on strategic planning and industry practices, which base their goals and staffing on customer needs.

3. The IRS' human capital management practices, including recruiting, training, and scheduling customer service representatives, are also facing challenges. The sites we visited faced difficulties in recruiting representatives due to job characteristics, training representatives and keeping them proficient, retaining skilled representatives, and scheduling representatives to meet forecasted staffing requirements.

4. The IRS is implementing an automated system to facilitate forecasting demand, scheduling staff, and tracking adherence to the schedule, but the system's forecasting and scheduling capability will not be usable until IRS has collected at least 1 year of call demand data in a consistent format. The system is expected to use historical data to more accurately forecast call demand and to centrally compare information on site staff resources in relation to forecasted demand.

5. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue take several steps to improve IRS' human capital management practices related to providing telephone customer service, including establishing a long-term, desired service-level goal, establishing a system for assessing customer service representatives' competency gaps, and ensuring that IRS' evaluations of human capital management practices consider the effects of those practices on its ability to achieve long- and short-term customer service goals.",1,{'n_points': 5}

1. Ginnie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that provides guarantees for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by government-insured or guaranteed loans, such as FHA and VA loans. These guarantees help make government-backed loans more accessible and affordable for low- to moderate-income borrowers.

2. Ginnie Mae's mission is to expand affordable housing in America by linking capital markets to the nation's housing markets, and it operates as a unit of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

3. Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue MBS, but rather provides guarantees backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government that investors will receive timely payments of principal and interest on securities supported by pools of government-backed loans.

4. Ginnie Mae has several different products, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and Multiclass Securities Program, which offer varying levels of flexibility and risk management for investors.

5. Ginnie Mae's share of the total MBS market has declined significantly since 1985, from 42% to 7% in 2004, due to the rapid growth of the conventional MBS market and the increasing availability of private mortgage insurance and subprime loans.

6. Despite this decline, Ginnie Mae continues to finance the great majority of FHA and VA loans, and its securities have historically represented roughly 90% of the market for these loans.

7. Ginnie Mae faces challenges in maintaining its liquidity and credit quality, as the decline in its market share and the increasing prepayment rates of its securities could lead to reduced investor demand and higher interest rates for borrowers.

8. Ginnie Mae has taken steps to address these challenges, including expanding its product offerings, improving its disclosures, and increasing its commitment authority to 2 years to provide more flexibility in planning its guarantee volume.

9. However, Ginnie Mae still faces challenges in managing its internal operations, including ensuring the accuracy and reliability of its data systems and maintaining effective contract management, given its reliance on contractors to carry out most of its operations.

10. To address these challenges, Ginnie Mae has ongoing initiatives, such as its Business Process Improvement Plan, and has received support from HUD and other stakeholders to improve its operations and maintain its mission of supporting government-backed loan programs.

DOD agreed that $592 million of the adjustments should not have been made and reversed them, but the remaining $23 million still needs to be reviewed.

2. The reversal of the $592 million adjustments identified additional accounting problems that require detailed reviews to determine the correct accounting actions. DOD officials estimate that it will take over 21,000 hours to correct the accounting for 30 contracts involved in the reversals.

3. DOD's review of $291 million of closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2001 found that $172 million were either illegal or otherwise improper. DOD officials agreed to reverse and correct these adjustments, and the remaining $119 million was for adequately documented corrections of errors.

4. The DOD's contract reconciliation system (CRS) and other controls necessary to ensure that adjustments to closed appropriation accounts were proper were not in place until the end of fiscal year 2001. DOD's implementation of controls to identify and prevent illegal and otherwise improper adjustments has resulted in an 80% reduction of closed account adjustments during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002.

5. The DOD's use of Appropriation Control and Resource Numbers (ACRNs) and changes in contract payment allocations create payment problems by increasing the amount of data that must be entered and opportunities for errors. Simplifying accounting and contract payment allocation terms is key to reforming DOD's financial management.

6. The General Accounting Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to continue to monitor adjustments to closed appropriation accounts and ensure that any potential Antideficiency Act violations are promptly investigated and reported. The GAO also recommends that DOD continue to implement controls to identify and prevent illegal and otherwise improper adjustments.

1. The Internet has grown significantly in importance to American businesses and consumers, serving as the host for hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce each year, and is also a critical resource supporting vital services such as power distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense.

2. The Internet relies on the domain name system to ensure the uniqueness of each e-mail and Web site address, and the rules that govern this system determine which top-level domains are recognized by most computers connected to the Internet.

3. The domain name system is managed by a set of 13 computers called ""root servers,"" which are responsible for coordinating the translation of domain names into Internet addresses.

4. The U.S. government initially supported the implementation of the domain name system for nearly a decade, largely through a Department of Defense contract, but in 1997, the Department of Commerce began a process for transitioning the technical responsibility for the domain name system to the private sector.

5. In June 1998, the Department of Commerce issued a general statement of policy, known as the ""White Paper,"" which stated that the U.S. government was committed to a transition that would allow the private sector to take leadership for the management of the domain name system.

6. The White Paper designated the stability and security of the Internet as the top priority of the transition and tasked ICANN and the Department with developing operational requirements and security policies to enhance the stability and security of the root servers.

7. ICANN has made significant progress in carrying out MOU tasks related to increasing competition, but progress has been slower on activities designed to address the other guiding principles of the transition effort, including increasing the stability and security of the Internet and ensuring representation of the Internet community in domain name policy-making.

8. ICANN's Board has approved a model agreement to formalize the relationship between the root server operators and ICANN, but no agreements have been reached with any of the operators as of May 2002.

9. ICANN has not resolved the question of how to fully implement its structure, especially the at-large Board members, and the Department has been reluctant to comment on ICANN's progress due to sensitivity to international concerns.

10. The Department of Commerce is responsible for general oversight of work done under the MOU and will be faced with deciding whether the MOU should be extended for a third time in September 2002, and if so, what amendments to the MOU are needed.

The OST was established in 1994 to oversee the trust reform efforts, which include implementing the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994.

2. The OST has made significant progress in implementing trust fund management reforms, including the development of a comprehensive trust management plan, the creation of a trust portal, and the implementation of a trust beneficiary call center. However, the OST has not provided a timetable for completing the remaining trust reform activities and has not developed a plan for future trust fund operations once reforms are completed.

3. The OST relies heavily on contractors to perform many of its trust reform activities, with nearly 21 percent of its appropriated funds going to contracting in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. However, the OST has faced criticism for its contracting practices, including allegations of preferential treatment of certain contractors.

4. The OST has also faced criticism for its compensation practices, including the provision of retention allowances to Senior Executive Service (SES) managers. In 2005, the Principal Deputy Special Trustee received a retention allowance, which raised her total compensation to the maximum allowable for SES employees.

5. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended that the Secretary of the Interior direct the Special Trustee to provide a timetable for completing the trust fund management reforms, develop a plan for future trust fund operations, and reexamine the workforce needs of the OST to identify opportunities for realigning or further reducing expenditures and staffing levels.

2. The GCPR project aimed to create an electronic interface that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities to access data from each other's health information systems, but it faced management weaknesses and was later revised to become the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) program.

3. The FHIE program was fully operational by December 2004, allowing VA providers at all VA medical centers and clinics nationwide to access data on separated service members, and it contained historical clinical health data on 2.3 million unique patients from 1989 on.

4. VA and DOD are working on a longer-term goal to achieve a virtual medical record based on the two-way exchange of computable data between their health information systems, which requires the development of an interface linking their data repositories, known as the Clinical Data Repository (CHDR) initiative.

5. The CHDR initiative has made progress, including the successful completion of Phase I in September 2004 and the development of an architecture for the electronic interface, but it still faces challenges, including the need for a highly disciplined approach to project management and the development of a detailed project management plan.

6. VA and DOD have also made progress in their near-term initiatives, including the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) and the Laboratory Data Sharing Interface (LDSI), which enable the exchange of electronic medical information between VA and DOD facilities, but they still face significant challenges before they can achieve their long-term goals.

1. The Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) describes the desired outcome of an income tax audit as the determination of the correct taxable income and tax liability of the person or entity under audit.

2. The IRS uses nine audit standards to define audit quality, which address issues such as scope, techniques, technical conclusions, reports, and time management of an audit, as well as workpaper preparation.

3. Audit workpapers provide documentation on the scope of the audit and the diligence with which it was completed, and are used to support the auditor's report and conclusions.

4. The primary tool used by the IRS to control quality under the nine standards is the review of ongoing audit work, which is the responsibility of IRS' first-line supervisors, called group managers.

5. The Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS) is used to collect information about the audit process, changes to the process, level of audit quality, and success of any efforts to improve the process and quality.

6. A review of IRS audit workpapers found that auditors did not always meet the requirements laid out under the workpaper standard, which requires that workpapers provide the principal support for the auditor's report and document the procedures applied, tests performed, information obtained, and conclusions reached.

7. The review found several problems with the workpapers, including missing or incomplete activity records, missing workpaper summaries, and workpapers that were not legible or complete.

8. The review also found that there was limited documentation of supervisory review of the workpapers, which is a primary tool in the IRS' efforts to control quality.

9. The IRS has historically found problems with the quality of its workpapers, and EQMS evaluations have indicated that IRS auditors met all of the key elements of the workpaper standard in no more than 72 percent of the audits.

10. The IRS has agreed to make revisions to the IRM instructions to implement a recommendation to require audit supervisors to document their review of audit workpapers as a control over the quality of audits and the associated workpapers.

2. The ATA program offers a wide range of counterterrorism assistance to partner nations, including training courses and grants of counterterrorism equipment, such as small arms and bomb detection equipment.

3. The program's curricula and training focus on enhancing critical counterterrorism capabilities, covering issues such as crisis management and response, cyberterrorism, and dignitary protection.

4. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism, the head of S/CT, is statutorily charged with the overall supervision and coordination of the U.S. government's counterterrorism activities, including the ATA program.

5. However, the report found that S/CT provides minimal policy guidance to DS/T/ATA, and the assessments and reviews conducted by DS/T/ATA are not systematically linked to resource allocation decisions, which may limit the program's ability to improve partner nation's counterterrorism capabilities.

6. The report also found that DS/T/ATA's needs assessments and program reviews are not consistently useful for determining what type of assistance to provide, and that the assessments and reviews are not systematically linked to resource allocation decisions.

7. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to identify goals and report on the degree to which goals are met, but the report found that State had not developed clear measures and a process for assessing sustainability and had not integrated the concept into program planning.

8. The report also found that State's annual reports on ATA contained inaccurate data regarding basic program information, did not provide systematic assessments of program results, and lacked other information necessary to evaluate program effectiveness.

9. The report recommended that Congress reconsider the requirement that the Secretary of State provide an annual report on the nature and amount of U.S. government counterterrorism assistance provided abroad, and that the Secretary of State take actions to improve the ATA program guidance, needs assessment and program review process, and assessments of ATA program outcomes.

1. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides two approaches for reorganizing or terminating a large financial company: judicial bankruptcy process and special legal and regulatory resolution regimes. The judicial bankruptcy process involves filing a bankruptcy petition, which operates as an automatic stay, stopping most lawsuits, foreclosures, and other collection activities against the debtor. The process aims to help individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts they cannot repay and help creditors receive some payment in an equitable manner.

2. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code has several chapters, including Chapter 7, which governs liquidation, and Chapter 11, which governs reorganization. Chapter 7 involves a court-supervised procedure where a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor's estate, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors. Chapter 11 allows debtors to continue some or all of their operations subject to court supervision as a way to satisfy creditor claims.

3. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code has undergone changes to address the challenges associated with the reorganization of large financial firms. The Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861) and the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 5421) were proposed bills that aimed to address these challenges. The bills would have added new chapters to the Code, changed the treatment of qualified financial contracts (QFCs), and designated judges to hear cases involving large financial institutions.

4. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code has been used to resolve several high-profile financial company bankruptcies, including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., MF Global Holdings Ltd., and Washington Mutual Inc. These cases involved complex litigation and distributions to creditors. The U.S. government has also taken steps to improve cross-border coordination to facilitate the liquidation and reorganization of failed large financial companies under bankruptcy, including the adoption of Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

This vision includes the use of advanced metering infrastructure, smart switches, and high-resolution monitors to improve the overall condition of the grid.

2. The electricity industry faces significant cybersecurity threats, including intentional and unintentional threats from various sources, such as hackers, foreign nations, and terrorists. These threats can disrupt critical services, including electrical power, and have a significant impact on the economy and human life. To address these threats, key entities, including NERC, FERC, NIST, DHS, and the Department of Energy, have taken steps to provide guidance and support for protecting the sector against cyber threats, but continued attention is needed to mitigate the risk these threats pose to the electricity grid.

The federal government faces significant skills gaps in various occupations, including cybersecurity, acquisitions, and nursing, which can impede the government's ability to serve the public effectively and achieve results. These gaps are exacerbated by budget pressures, changing work requirements, and a potential wave of employee retirements.

2. The current federal compensation system is outdated and does not align with modern compensation principles, which prioritize skills, knowledge, and performance. The system rewards length of service rather than individual performance and contributions, and it automatically provides across-the-board annual pay increases, even to poor performers.

3. To address these challenges, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that agencies implement a more market-based and performance-oriented pay system, which would require effective performance management systems, training on leadership and management skills, and a cultural shift to prioritize performance over longevity.

4. Agencies can leverage various tools and flexibilities to improve their personnel management, including strategic workforce planning, recruitment and hiring, workforce development, and employee engagement. However, they must also hold agencies accountable for fully leveraging these resources and addressing long-standing issues such as poor performance management and inadequate human capital capacity.

In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received about $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion, respectively, in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses.

2. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the military services have lost visibility over the funds provided through annual appropriations, including knowing how much, if any, was used to support GWOT in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. DOD's accounting systems do not separately identify the portion of the department's annual appropriations that were described as having been requested to support GWOT.

3. DOD did not explicitly take into account the almost $7.9 billion in funds the Army, Air Force, and Navy received in their annual appropriations through Program Budget Decision 736 to help fund GWOT in fiscal year 2004. If counted in fiscal year 2004 and applied to the services' military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts, these amounts could have reduced the Army's need to transfer funds from other activities and eliminated the GWOT gaps for the Air Force and the Navy.

4. In fiscal year 2005, the Army and the Air Force are again projecting obligations for the war above their supplemental appropriations, and DOD is taking steps to cover the gaps. The additional funds that were included in DOD's annual appropriation to help fund the war potentially could reduce or eliminate the projected gaps for the Army and Air Force.

5. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Defense adjust future supplemental appropriations requests to reflect the additional funds DOD received in its annual appropriations to support GWOT and explain these adjustments to the Congress. The GAO also recommends that DOD consider the additional GWOT funds provided through DOD's annual appropriations in addressing any future GWOT funding needs and document its decisions.

The extension allowed Treasury to retain resources to respond to threats to financial stability and maintain the capacity to react should financial markets need further assistance.

2. Treasury's decision to extend TARP was influenced by various factors, including the need to maintain the capacity to respond to unforeseen threats or unanticipated shocks, the inadequacy of available statutory tools to deal with threats to financial stability, and the importance of having financial regulatory reform in place before TARP expires in October 2010.

3. Large departments, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), are turning to enterprisewide contracts to acquire goods and services, which can leverage purchasing power but do not allow purchases outside of the original acquiring activity.

4. Interagency and enterprisewide contracts can reduce contracting administrative overhead, provide information on agency spending, support strategic sourcing initiatives, and avoid fees charged for using interagency contracts.

5. The federal government lacks reliable and comprehensive data to effectively leverage, manage, and oversee these contracts, including the total number of MACs and enterprisewide contracts currently approved and in use by agencies.

6. Agencies have established their own MACs and enterprisewide contracts due to various reasons, including avoiding fees, gaining more control over procurements, and allowing for the use of cost reimbursement contracts, which can lead to duplication of effort and increased costs.

7. GSA's MAS program is the primary governmentwide buying program aimed at helping the federal government leverage its buying power when buying commercial goods and services, but it faces challenges in effectively managing the program, including a lack of transactional data and limited use of selected pricing tools.

8. The federal government needs to address long-standing problems with the quality of data on interagency and enterprisewide contracts, establish consistent governmentwide policy on the creation, use, and costs of awarding and administering these contracts, and improve data collection and program assessment tools to realize the strategic value of using these contracts.

2. To address these issues, the government created 18F and USDS, two programs aimed at improving public-facing federal digital services. 18F was created in March 2014 by GSA, while USDS was launched in August 2014 by the Administration.

3. 18F provides a team of expert designers, developers, technologists, researchers, and product specialists to help rapidly deploy tools and online services that are reusable, less costly, and easier for people and businesses to use. USDS, on the other hand, aims to transform the most important digital services for citizens by recruiting private sector experts and partnering them with government agencies.

4. Both 18F and USDS have provided a variety of development and consulting services to agencies to support their technology efforts. Between March 2014 and August 2015, 18F staff helped 18 agencies with 32 projects, while USDS provided assistance on 13 projects at 11 agencies.

5. Agencies were generally satisfied with the services they received from 18F and USDS. A majority of managers were satisfied with the services provided by both programs, with an average score of 4.38 for 18F and 4.67 for USDS.

6. However, both 18F and USDS have areas for improvement. 18F has not yet fully recovered its costs and has not established performance measures and targets tied to achieving full cost recovery. USDS has not fully implemented important program management practices, including establishing performance measures and targets for each goal.

7. To help agencies effectively deliver digital services, the President's Budget for fiscal year 2016 proposed funding for digital service teams at 25 agencies. However, only 6 agencies have established charters with USDS, and the other 19 agencies have not yet established digital service teams.

8. The lack of defined relationships between agency CIOs and digital service teams is a concern. USDS policy does not describe the expected responsibilities and authorities governing the relationships between CIOs and digital service teams, which may hinder the ability for CIOs to carry out their responsibilities for IT management.

2. The aged dependency ratio, which measures the number of workers available to support each retiree, is expected to rise from 21 percent in 2000 to 35 percent by 2030, meaning there will be fewer than three workers for every person over 65.

3. The growth of the labor force of younger workers has slowed, with an average annual growth rate of 0.3 percent projected from 2000 to 2025, compared to 1.9 percent from 1950 to 1990.

4. Social Security retirement policy changes, such as eliminating the reduction of benefits for earnings above a certain age and increasing the delayed retirement credit, aim to strengthen incentives to work longer.

5. The number of older workers will grow substantially over the next two decades, with 31.8 million older labor force participants projected in 2015 and 33.3 million in 2025, representing 20 percent of the total workforce.

6. Older workers are increasingly participating in the labor force, with 30 percent of persons 55 and older participating in 2000, expected to grow to 37 percent by 2015, driven by the growth in the number of older women and their labor force participation rates.

7. Older workers are employed in a diverse range of occupations, with a growing proportion in white-collar occupations, and are expected to make relatively greater gains in earnings than younger workers between 2000 and 2008.

8. Employers are experimenting with flexible employment arrangements, such as rehiring retirees, reduced work schedules, and job sharing, to retain and extend the careers of older workers, but these arrangements are not yet widespread in the private sector.

1. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was created by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and was permanently established in 2000. The program allows citizens of participating countries to travel to the United States without a visa for business or tourism purposes.

2. To qualify for the VWP, a country must meet certain requirements, including offering reciprocal visa-free travel privileges to U.S. citizens, having a low visa refusal rate, issuing machine-readable passports, and sharing information on lost or stolen passports.

3. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) was implemented in 2008 to enhance program security and facilitate the screening of VWP applicants. ESTA requires applicants to provide biographical information and answer eligibility questions, and the system evaluates the applicant's information to determine eligibility for VWP travel.

4. Since the implementation of ESTA, the number of individuals submitting ESTA applications has increased significantly, with over 28.6 million applications submitted from August 2008 to December 2010. The denial rate for ESTA applications has decreased from 0.42 percent in 2008 to 0.24 percent in 2010.

5. Despite the implementation of ESTA, there are still concerns about the security risks associated with VWP travel. DHS has not fully analyzed the potential risks posed by cases where carriers boarded passengers for VWP travel without verifying that they had ESTA approval, and the agency has not established a target date for completing this review.

6. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security take two actions to ensure that DHS can identify and mitigate potential security risks associated with the VWP: establish time frames for the regular review and documentation of cases of VWP passengers traveling to a U.S. port of entry without verified ESTA approval, and take steps to address delays in the biennial country review process so that the mandated country reports can be completed on time.

1. The US child welfare system has been struggling to keep pace with the growing number of children in foster care, with the foster care population increasing from 276,000 in 1984 to 494,000 in 1995. To address this issue, states have implemented various initiatives to expedite the permanency planning process, including reducing the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing, and increasing the use of concurrent planning to work towards reunification and permanent placement simultaneously.

2. While some states have reported improvements in the permanency planning process, such as reducing the number of different foster care placements and expediting the termination of parental rights, the lack of systematic evaluations and outcome information makes it difficult to assess the overall impact of these initiatives. States have identified key factors that contribute to the success of these initiatives, including long-term involvement of officials, involvement of key stakeholders, and the availability of resources, but more evaluation data is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of these efforts.

1. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA Act) was signed into law on May 9, 2014, requiring federal agencies to disclose expenditures and link agency spending information to federal program activities.

2. The DATA Act requires government-wide reporting on a greater variety of federal funds, including budget and financial information, and tracking of these funds at multiple points in the federal spending lifecycle.

3. To improve the quality of data, the act requires agency-reported award and financial information to comply with new data standards established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury.

4. OMB has taken steps to help agencies meet their reporting requirements, including establishing 57 standardized data element definitions and issuing guidance on reporting requirements.

5. However, agencies have identified several challenges in implementing the DATA Act, including issues with internal controls over financial reporting, financial management systems, and information technology (IT) security and controls.

6. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified several risks to data quality, including material weaknesses and significant deficiencies reported in agencies' financial audits and widespread and longstanding issues that present risks to agencies' ability to submit quality data.

7. The GAO has made several recommendations to improve the implementation of the DATA Act, including clarifying guidance on agency responsibilities for reporting awards funded by non-annual appropriations and developing a government-wide oversight process to regularly assess the consistency of information reported by federal agencies.

8. OMB and Treasury have taken some steps to address these recommendations, but more remains to be done to ensure effective implementation of the DATA Act and to provide complete and consistent spending data to the public.

1. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has an agreement with the Administrative Resource Center (ARC) to provide contracting support for a fee, as OSC does not have in-house contracting staff. This agreement is a mechanism for interagency contracting, which involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order, and the contractors providing the goods and services.

2. In contracting with MPRI for an organizational assessment, several required steps were not taken, including competition among Schedule vendors, a convincing demonstration of why a sole-source order was necessary, and a determination of the reasonableness of MPRI's price.

3. OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer's representatives without authorization or training and performed other duties that should have been reserved for the contracting officer.

4. The OSC hired an intermittent consultant, Alan J. Hicks, using the appointment authority under 5 U.S.C. § 3109, to work on an organizational assessment and efficiency and curriculum development. Hicks's tasks were consistent with OPM criteria for appropriate uses of expert and consultant appointments.

5. OSC employees who believe a prohibited personnel practice has occurred may seek redress from OSC, but addressing such allegations within OSC becomes unworkable when the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel is involved, as all OSC employees ultimately report to the Special Counsel.

6. The MSPB and EEOC have taken steps to address potential conflicts of interest when their own employees use their respective redress processes, but OSC would need explicit authority to implement similar options.

7. We recommend that the Director of ARC's Division of Procurement take actions to ensure that documents prepared by program offices requesting contracting assistance are carefully reviewed for compliance with competition requirements and that ARC contracting staff ensure that only authorized program officials act as contracting officer's representatives.

8. We also recommend that the Special Counsel put in place procedures to ensure that only those officials who have taken the required training and been designated as contracting officer's representatives act in that role and that program staff do not exceed their authority in interacting with contractors.

1. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a mission to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans by ensuring they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials.

2. The VA has three major components: the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), which are responsible for carrying out its mission.

3. The VA relies on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits, working in various locations throughout the nation, including 167 medical centers, 800 community-based outpatient clinics, and 131 national cemeteries.

4. The VA operates and maintains an IT infrastructure to provide reliable, available, and responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers, as well as veterans, with approximately 240 information systems and 314,000 desktop computers.

5. The VA has old systems, such as the Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) and the Benefits Delivery Network (BDN), which are over 50 years old and in need of modernization or replacement.

6. The VA plans to retire PAID and BDN in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and has a 6-year strategic plan to improve access to benefits and services through the use of improved technology.

7. The VA has faced IT challenges, including the failed modernization of a system, suspended development of another system, and the extent of system interoperability with the Department of Defense (DOD), which present risks to the timeliness, quality, and safety of VA health care.

8. The VA has made progress in developing and implementing the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), but still faces challenges, including a lack of reliable cost estimates, system response time goals, and user satisfaction goals.

9. The VA's care in the community programs have grown considerably in recent years, posing staffing and workload challenges for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which has had ongoing difficulty processing claims from community providers in a timely manner.

The Medicare program, managed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), serves about 33 million beneficiaries and processes a high volume of claims from hundreds of thousands of providers. HCFA is also responsible for paying and monitoring over 400 managed care health plans that serve more than 5 million beneficiaries.

2. The Medicare statute divides benefits into two parts: part A, which covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and certain home health care services, and part B, which covers physician and outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, and ambulance and other medical services and supplies. HCFA has implemented reforms under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) to enhance Medicare's anti-fraud-and-abuse activities and introduce new health plan options.

3. HCFA is facing significant challenges, including the loss of experienced staff, which has further diminished its capacity to carry out Medicare's numerous and challenging activities. The agency is also struggling to implement the BBA-related reforms, including the Medicare+Choice program, and modernize its information systems.

4. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has identified several areas of concern, including the need for HCFA to be more vigilant in addressing program vulnerabilities, the importance of effective implementation of new legislation to reduce fraud and abuse, and the need for HCFA to prioritize its activities and resource needs to ensure that critical functions are not receiving back-burner attention.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from excise taxes paid by users of the National Airspace System (NAS), including airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo shipment.

2. In addition to Trust Fund revenues, General Fund revenues have been used to fund FAA in most years, with $2.6 billion appropriated for fiscal year 2006, representing about 18 percent of FAA's total appropriation.

3. The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system, and it provides funding for FAA's capital accounts, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account.

4. The administration's reauthorization proposal would change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges, with funding for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) coming primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft.

5. The proposal would also create an advisory board and give FAA limited borrowing authority, and it would establish two new budget accounts, the Air Traffic Organization and the Safety and Operations account, to align with FAA's lines of business.

6. FAA has expressed concern that revenues from the current funding structure depend heavily on factors, such as ticket prices, that are not connected to FAA's workload and costs, raising concerns about long-term revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency.

7. The administration's proposed changes for funding FAA are intended to address these concerns by linking FAA's revenues more closely with its costs, but the effectiveness of the proposed funding structure depends critically on the soundness of FAA's cost allocation system and how closely the proposed funding structure adheres to the principle of cost-based funding.

8. FAA's new cost allocation study has raised concerns about the methodology used to allocate costs to users, and the proposed fuel tax rates may not yield the revenue that FAA expects to collect from fuel taxes due to possible reductions in fuel purchases.

9. The proposed creation of an advisory board raises questions about the influence that NAS users would have on fee setting and the impact that such a board would have on congressional oversight.

10. The administration's proposal to align FAA's budget accounts with FAA's lines of business has advantages and disadvantages, and adopting this proposal is not necessary to provide more money to FAA if Congress thinks that additional spending on aviation is needed to address air traffic increases and new",1,{'n_points': 10}

1. Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a compact, mixed-use, and ""walkable"" neighborhood located near transit, with a typical distance of up to a half-mile from a transit station.

2. Research suggests that TOD can increase access to employment, educational, cultural, and other opportunities by promoting transportation options to households, resulting in increased transit ridership and reduced road congestion.

3. Local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, local governments, regional councils, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts play important roles in the planning and implementation of a TOD.

4. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD, but it does not have a discrete program for TOD, and its role in TOD has been expanding in recent years.

5. Factors that support TOD include demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and efficient access to jobs and centers of activity.

6. Market demand for real estate is driven by the strength of the local economy, and cities with strong local economies are more likely to support TOD.

7. Large parcels of land available for development, such as surface parking lots or underutilized industrial land, can also support TOD.

8. Resident support for transit and TOD is crucial, and cities with a high concentration of people 18 to 34 years old tend to be more supportive of TOD.

9. Local governments can use policies such as zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives to encourage TOD.

10. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) evaluates factors related to TOD when assessing proposed projects, including land use, economic development, and transit ridership, but its assessment is limited by factors such as real estate market conditions and local resident support.

2. Despite the SSA's efforts, fewer than 2 percent of workers who pay Social Security taxes request these statements each year, and the SSA plans to mail statements automatically to over 70 million workers by fiscal year 2000.

3. The PEBES is intended to inform the public about benefits available under SSA's programs, assist workers in planning for their financial future, and ensure that Social Security earnings records are complete and accurate.

4. The SSA estimates that 608 staff-years will be required to handle the PEBES workload in fiscal year 2000, with a projected cost of $80 million, including $56 million for production costs and $24 million for personnel costs.

5. The benefit estimates provided in the PEBES are based on certain assumptions about an individual's future employment and earnings, but do not take into consideration special circumstances that could affect a worker's actual retirement benefit, such as federal workers who are eligible for both Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security benefits.

6. The SSA has conducted several surveys and focus groups to assess the public's reaction to receiving an unsolicited PEBES, and while overall public reaction has been favorable, the statement still provides too much information and is too complex, making it difficult for readers to understand.

7. To improve the PEBES, the SSA should revise the statement to improve its layout and design, simplify explanations, and evaluate and test alternative formats for communicating the information presented in the PEBES, and the SSA's senior leadership should be involved in the redesign process to ensure that the statement effectively conveys information to the public about SSA's programs and benefits.

1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two programs that provide benefits for individuals with disabilities: Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs use the same definition of disability for initial entitlement, which requires a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that lasts at least one year or results in death and prevents an individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity.

2. DI was established in 1956 as an insurance program to help replace earnings lost due to disability, while SSI was established in 1972 to provide a standard minimum level of income for individuals with disabilities. Eligibility for DI requires a past work history, while SSI does not. Benefits are financed by payroll taxes for DI and general revenues for SSI.

3. Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both programs, comprise about 14% of SSA's disability population. They are more likely to have mental impairments and be female, with an average age of 45. Most concurrent beneficiaries work, but their earnings are low, with a median of $250 per month. They often do not take advantage of work incentives available to them under the SSI and/or DI programs.

4. The SSA faces challenges in serving concurrent beneficiaries, including a lack of integrated guidance and procedures for administering the DI and SSI programs. This can lead to overpayments and underpayments, as well as less-than-ideal beneficiary decisions about work. The SSA has taken steps to address these challenges, including developing new training and software, but more work is needed to ensure that concurrent beneficiaries receive adequate service and that program funds are used effectively.

However, since a final rulemaking is not completed, the FAA only allows UAS access to the national airspace on a case-by-case basis.

2. The FAA provides access to the airspace through three different means: Certificates of Waiver or Authorization (COA), Special Airworthiness Certificates in the Experimental Category, and Section 333 exemptions. These methods allow public entities, civil entities, and commercial entities to apply for authorization to operate UASs in the national airspace.

3. The FAA has been planning for further integration of UAS into the national airspace system, and has issued the UAS Comprehensive Plan and the UAS Integration Roadmap, which provide a broad framework to guide UAS integration efforts. The FAA plans to use a phased approach to integrate UAS into the national airspace system, with three phases: Accommodation, Integration, and Evolution.

4. The FAA has made progress in integrating UAS into the national airspace system, including the establishment of six UAS test sites, the issuance of 674 public COAs, and the granting of 48 Section 333 exemptions. The test sites have become operational and have conducted over 195 UAS flights, providing operations and safety data to the FAA.

5. The FAA faces several critical steps to keep the UAS integration process moving forward, including issuing a final rule for small UASs, developing a detailed implementation plan, and providing incentives to encourage greater UAS operations at the test sites.

2. The program has evolved over time, with projects becoming more complex and costly, and the number of projects costing more than $500,000 in Afghanistan increasing from 9 in fiscal year 2004 to 129 in fiscal year 2008.

3. Management and execution of the CERP program is the responsibility of officials at CJTF-101 headquarters, brigades, and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), with CJTF-101 personnel including a CERP manager, staff attorney, and resource manager.

4. The CJTF-101 guidance assigns responsibilities to various staff sections, such as engineering, medical, and contracting, when specific projects require it, and brigade commanders are responsible for the overall execution of CERP in their areas of responsibility.

5. Due to a lack of personnel, key duties such as performing headquarters staff assistance visits and site visits to monitor project status and contractor performance were either not performed or not consistently performed.

6. The lack of subject-matter experts, such as agriculture and public health officials, puts DOD at risk of being unable to identify and correct poor contractor performance, which could affect the cost, completion, and sustainability of CERP projects.

7. CERP personnel had little or no training on their duties and responsibilities, and personnel we spoke with in Afghanistan and those who had recently returned from Afghanistan believed they needed more quality training to perform their missions effectively.

8. The lack of training affects the quality of the oversight provided and can increase the risk of fraud, with the Principal Deputy Inspector General Department of Defense testifying that contingency contracting, specifically the CERP, is highly vulnerable to fraud and corruption due to a lack of oversight.

9. Despite coordination mechanisms in place, the U.S. government lacks an easily accessible mechanism to identify previous and ongoing development projects, and a centralized project-development database is needed to capture reliable and verified data for all development projects in Afghanistan.

10. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the commander of U.S. Central Command to evaluate workforce requirements and ensure adequate staff to administer the CERP, and collaborate with USAID to create a centralized project-development database for use by U.S. government agencies in Afghanistan.

2. DOD supplies servicemembers with a protective ensemble consisting of a suit, mask with breathing filter, rubber boots, butyl gloves, and hoods as required, but the equipment has several issues, including causing unacceptable heat stress, limiting freedom of movement, and being bulky.

3. The existing suits are no longer manufactured, can be used for up to 14 years from the date of manufacture, and will expire by 2007, so DOD developed new, lightweight individual protective equipment such as the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) suits.

4. DOD plans to spend about $5.7 billion on planning for chemical and biological defense, acquisition of defense equipment, facilities construction, and research and development from fiscal years 2002 through 2007.

5. DOD's assessment process for determining the risk to military operations is unreliable, and the Department's current determination that the risk is generally low is inaccurate due to flawed methodology and inaccurate data.

6. DOD's current inventory information on chemical and biological equipment is unreliable for making an accurate risk assessment because DOD and the services cannot easily link inventory records, lack data on suit expiration dates, and have miscalculated the requirements and the number of suits available.

7. The services collectively had no more than 4,348,999 suits of all types on hand as of September 30, 2000, but DOD reported a shortage of about 1.7 million protective suits, and the risk category changed to high for suits when the errors and miscounts were included.

8. DOD's plan to buy fewer new suits is influenced by expiration of the suits and budgetary considerations, and the shortage will increase to about 2.2 million suits by 2006.

9. DOD is attempting to mitigate some of the shortages by procuring more hoods and boots, and some opportunities exist for one service to assist another, but interoperability problems still exist.

1. Program evaluations are systematic studies that use research methods to address specific questions about program performance, closely related to performance measurement and reporting. They assess the achievement of a program's objectives and other aspects of performance in the context in which the program operates.

2. Evaluations can be designed to better isolate the causal impact of programs from other external economic or environmental conditions in order to assess a program's effectiveness, providing a valuable supplement to ongoing performance reporting.

3. A 2013 survey of federal managers found that most federal managers reported lacking recent evaluations of their programs, with only about a third having recent evaluations of their programs or projects.

4. The majority of those who had evaluations reported that they contributed to understanding program performance, assessing program effectiveness or value, making changes to improve program management or performance, and sharing what works with others.

5. Experienced evaluators identified three strategies to facilitate evaluation influence: leadership support of evaluation, building a strong body of evidence, and engaging stakeholders throughout the evaluation process.

6. The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRAMA) established an expectation that evidence would have a greater role in agency decision making, requiring agencies to establish agency priority goals and government-wide cross-agency priority goals.

7. A 2017 survey of federal managers found that 40 percent of managers reported having access to recent evaluations of their programs, with most reporting that evaluations contributed to improving program performance and assessing program effectiveness.

8. The survey results reinforce lessons from previous reports that involving agency staff and executives in planning and conducting evaluations helps ensure that those evaluations are relevant, credible, and used in agency decision making, and that developing an evaluation plan or agenda is essential to ensure that even an agency's scarce research and evaluation resources are targeted to its most important issues.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Labor have oversight responsibilities to ensure the successful implementation of the executive order.

3. To measure and assess progress towards achieving the goals of the executive order, agencies and OPM use data about disability status that employees voluntarily self-report on the SF-256. However, concerns have been raised about the reliability of government statistics on the number of individuals with disabilities in the federal government due to the likelihood of underreporting.

4. The federal government has taken steps to improve the hiring and retention of individuals with disabilities, including the development of mandatory training programs for hiring managers and human resource personnel on the employment of individuals with disabilities. However, many agency plans do not meet the criteria identified by OPM as essential to becoming a model employer of people with disabilities.

5. To ensure that the federal government is well positioned to become a model employer of individuals with disabilities, the Director of OPM is recommended to take three actions: incorporate information about plan deficiencies into its regular reporting to the president, expedite the development of the mandatory training programs, and assess the extent to which the SF-256 accurately measures progress toward the executive order's goal and explore options for improving the accuracy of SF-256 reporting.

1. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is developing an automated land and mineral case processing system (ALMRS/Modernization) to manage public lands and resources, which is expected to cost around $403 million over 10 years. The system aims to automate land and mineral records, provide information for land and resource management activities, and increase public access to BLM records through the Internet.

2. The ALMRS/Modernization project consists of three components: ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (ALMRS IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems. The project has made significant progress, with most of the initial installation of computer and telecommunications equipment completed, and several software applications and related databases converted from COBOL to INFORMIX.

3. However, the project schedule is tight, with little time available to deal with unexpected problems, and the Bureau has recently rescheduled the final ALMRS IOC installation and database conversions from fiscal year 1996 to 1997 due to an anticipated reduction in funding. The project officials have also decided to obtain an independent verification and validation of ALMRS IOC software to ensure that it meets BLM's requirements.

4. The General Accounting Office (GAO) recommends that the Director, BLM, ensure that the entire ALMRS/Modernization is thoroughly stress-tested before it is deployed throughout the Bureau, as the current plan to stress-test only the ALMRS IOC portion of the modernized system may not provide assurance that all of the systems and technology can successfully process the workloads expected during peak operating periods.

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an independent organization affiliated with the United Nations, responsible for implementing policies and programs related to nuclear energy and non-proliferation. Its governing bodies include the General Conference and the Board of Governors, with the United States being a permanent member of the Board of Governors.

2. The IAEA derives its authority to establish and administer safeguards from its statute, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and regional non-proliferation treaties. The agency's safeguards objectives are to account for the amount of nuclear material necessary to produce a nuclear weapon and the time it would take a state to divert this material from peaceful use and produce a nuclear weapon.

3. The IAEA has taken steps to strengthen its safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program. This includes conducting short notice and unannounced inspections, collecting and analyzing environmental samples, and using measurement and surveillance systems that operate unattended.

4. Despite these efforts, the IAEA faces several limitations, including limited information about the nuclear activities of countries that are not members of the NPT, such as India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan. Additionally, more than half of the NPT signatories have not yet brought the Additional Protocol into force, which limits the agency's inspection efforts.

5. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has helped to curb nuclear proliferation by establishing guidelines governing the exports of nuclear materials and equipment. However, the group faces several weaknesses, including limited information sharing among members and a lack of consensus on new reforms.

6. The United States has provided significant assistance to Russia and other former Soviet countries to secure nuclear material and warheads, detect illicitly trafficked nuclear material, and eliminate excess stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear material. However, U.S. assistance programs have faced challenges, including a lack of access to key sites and corruption of foreign officials.

1. The public faces a high risk of critical services disruption due to the Year 2000 computing crisis, which could lead to delayed financial transactions, grounded flights, power loss, and national defense issues. America's infrastructure is a complex array of public and private enterprises with many interdependencies, making a single failure have adverse repercussions.

2. Key economic sectors that could be seriously affected if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant include information and telecommunications, banking and finance, health, safety, and emergency services, transportation, power and water, and manufacturing and small business.

3. The information and telecommunications sector is especially important, as it enables the electronic transfer of funds, distribution of electrical power, and control of gas and oil pipeline systems, and is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods.

4. The global nature of the problem poses a significant risk, with indications of Year 2000 readiness problems in the international arena, including a June 1998 informal World Bank survey that found only 18 of 127 countries had a national Year 2000 program.

5. Federal agencies are making slow progress in fixing their systems, with only 40 percent of mission-critical systems reported as compliant in May 1998, and many agencies are behind schedule and at high risk of not fixing their systems in time.

6. To address the Year 2000 problem, federal, state, and local governments must increase their efforts to ensure that major service disruptions do not occur, and greater leadership and partnerships are essential to meet the needs of the public at the turn of the century.

463,"1. The Information Quality Act (IQA) was enacted in 2001 as part of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001, requiring federal agencies to develop and implement guidelines for ensuring the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information they disseminate.

2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was responsible for developing governmentwide IQA guidelines, which were issued in 2002, and provided agencies with flexibility to develop their own guidelines tailored to their unique programs and information. The guidelines required agencies to establish an administrative mechanism for affected parties to request correction of information and included an appeals process.

3. By the end of fiscal year 2002, 14 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies had guidelines in place, but many independent agencies, including smaller nonregulatory ones, did not have guidelines or follow up with OMB to help them meet the act's provisions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was the only cabinet-level agency without department-level IQA guidelines, and many independent agencies did not have IQA guidelines or post them on their Web sites.

4. The implementation of IQA has resulted in a decline in the number of IQA requests, from over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004, due in part to agencies excluding simple or administrative errors from IQA correction mechanisms. However, the impact of IQA on agencies' operations and the quality of information is unclear due to a lack of comprehensive IQA-related cost or resource data, and agencies have not received funds for IQA implementation.",1,{'n_points': 4}

1. Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and channel them back to the economy by investing them. 
2. Banks generally use their deposits to make loans or invest in debt securities, while mutual funds invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks.
3. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with corporations increasingly tapping the securities markets for their financial needs.
4. Securitization, a process through which securities issuance supplants bank credit as a source of finance, has further diminished the importance of bank loans.
5. The growth of mutual funds has attracted sizable amounts of money that otherwise might have been placed in bank deposits, with the amount of money in mutual funds rising by almost $1.2 trillion since year-end 1989.
6. Despite this, some observers dispute the magnitude of the impact of mutual funds on deposits, with one study claiming that mutual fund inflows do not depend on outflows from the banking system.
7. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds has had little to no effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy, as both types of intermediaries generally invest a substantial portion of the funds they receive.
8. The flow of liquidity from mutual funds into the securities markets has enhanced the capacity of the securities markets to absorb new issues, with mutual funds making net purchases of corporate securities averaging $104 billion annually from 1990 to 1994.
9. The availability of credit for small businesses may be affected if their banks lose deposits to mutual funds, but this is a hypothetical possibility, and small banks may be able to fund existing and new loans by selling securities.
10. The channels of financing are varied, and a shift of customers' money from deposits into mutual funds need not reduce credit availability for any group of borrowers, although there remains the possibility that some borrowers from small banks might face credit availability constraints in certain circumstances.

2. Among the respondents, 81% reported modifying the formulas of one or more of their DB plans, with 58% of those covering collective-bargaining employees increasing the generosity of their DB plan formulas, and 48% of those covering nonbargaining employees decreasing the generosity of their DB plan formulas.
3. The key reasons cited for changing benefit formulas were ""unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements"" for nonbargaining employees and ""global or domestic competitive pressures"" in their industry for collectively bargained employees.
4. The survey also found that 62% of responding firms reported a freeze, or a plan amendment to limit some or all future pension accruals for some or all plan participants, for one or more of their plans, with 8% of plans being hard frozen and 20% being under a soft freeze or partial freeze.

1. The Refugee Act of 1980 defines a refugee as a person who is outside their country and unable or unwilling to return due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The Act also established a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the United States.

2. The federal government, in coordination with private organizations, implements the admission and resettlement process for refugees. The President determines the maximum number of refugees the United States may admit each year, and the number actually resettled is typically below this maximum.

3. Refugees are assigned to a national voluntary agency, which then decides where the refugee will live. The national voluntary agencies meet weekly to allocate individual refugees based on an annual evaluation of the communities' capacity to serve refugees. However, the process of consulting with local stakeholders, such as public schools and health departments, is often inadequate, leading to challenges in serving refugees.

4. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides funding for cash and medical assistance, as well as social services, to help refugees become economically self-sufficient. However, the current performance measures focus on short-term employment outcomes, which can result in a one-size-fits-all approach to employment services and may limit service providers' flexibility to provide services that benefit refugees in the long term.

5. The federal government has not effectively measured refugee integration, and there is no clear definition of integration. However, studies on refugee resettlement have identified indicators of integration, such as employment, English language acquisition, housing, physical and mental health, and social connections, as well as common facilitators of integration, including English language acquisition, employment, and social support from other refugees.

1. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 as an alternative to providing direct assistance after floods, with the goal of reducing the federal government's escalating costs for repairing flood damage after disasters.

2. NFIP provides government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, but it currently does not charge all program participants rates that reflect the full risk of flooding to their properties, with nearly one out of four NFIP policies based on a subsidized rate.

3. To address the financial challenges of NFIP, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that Congress take several steps, including charging premium rates that accurately reflect the risk of loss, including catastrophic losses, and eliminating subsidized rates and grandfathered rates.

4. Increasing mitigation efforts, such as elevation, relocation, and demolition, could reduce the extent of damage from flooding and help put NFIP on a firmer financial footing, but this could impose up-front costs on homeowners and communities.

5. Expanding participation in NFIP, which currently has a participation rate of around 50% in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), could help reduce taxpayer costs by reducing the number of property owners who might draw on federally funded postdisaster assistance, but this would require careful implementation.

6. Encouraging private market participation in flood insurance could transfer some or all of the federal government's risk exposure to the private markets and away from taxpayers, but this would require identifying ways to achieve that end, such as providing tax incentives or federal reinsurance to private insurers.

2. The 287(g) program allows state and local officers to have direct access to ICE databases and act in the stead of ICE agents by processing aliens for removal, but it requires a written agreement, background security checks, and training for participating officers.

3. The program has grown rapidly in recent years, with 67 state and local law enforcement agencies participating as of October 2008, and ICE has received increasing funding for the program, with $54.1 million allocated for fiscal year 2009.

4. However, the program lacks several management controls, including documented program objectives, specific requirements for using 287(g) authority, and defined supervision activities, which can lead to misuse of authority and inconsistent implementation.

5. ICE officials stated that they use various controls to govern the 287(g) program, including background checks, training, and MOAs, but these controls are not consistently communicated to participating agencies, and ICE has not defined the responsibilities required of ICE agents directing and supervising local officers.

6. Participating agencies reported various benefits of the program, including reducing crime and making communities safer, but also expressed concerns about the program, such as racial profiling and deportation of aliens for minor offenses.

7. To address these concerns, ICE is working to develop performance measures for the program, but lacks a plan for their development, and the compliance inspections conducted by ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility do not include performance assessments.

6. The SEC has made significant changes to its traditional examination approach, focusing on targeted examinations and continuous monitoring of larger funds to better detect potential violations.

7. The SEC's revised examination approach includes placing a higher priority on sweep and cause examinations and a lower priority on routine examinations, conducting routine examinations of high-risk funds once every 2 to 3 years, and randomly selecting low-risk firms for examination.

8. The SEC is creating teams of examiners to monitor and examine the activities of the largest and most complex groups of affiliated advisers and mutual funds.

9. The SEC is developing a surveillance program to support its oversight of all funds and advisers, which will help identify aberrant patterns in fund and adviser activities and potential fraud or abusive schemes.

The First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc. received a $970 million capital infusion from the FDIC in 1988 as part of an open bank assistance agreement, which also required the creation of a ""collecting bank"" to dispose of troubled assets. The agreement aimed to restore First City's financial health and reduce its subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20.

2. Despite the recapitalization, First City banks continued to experience financial difficulties due to high-risk loans, loan portfolio problems, and high operating expenses. The banks' loan portfolios included high-risk loans such as loans to finance highly leveraged transactions, international loans, and out-of-territory lending.

3. In 1992, OCC determined that First City-Houston was insolvent and required the bank to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) by $67 million. The OCC examiners' findings were based on both objective and subjective considerations, including the bank's history of inadequate recognition of loan quality problems and provision for ALLL.

4. The FDIC considered two basic alternatives to provide for the orderly resolution of the First City banks: liquidating them immediately or placing them under FDIC control and operating them as bridge banks until a sale could be arranged. The FDIC chose the latter alternative, which resulted in the sale of all 20 of the bridge banks in January 1993.

5. The FDIC's provision of $970 million financial assistance to First City banks in 1988 and their ultimate failure less than 5 years later raised concerns about the effectiveness of open bank assistance. The GAO review of the events surrounding First City Bancorporation of Texas' 1988 and 1992 resolutions identified several lessons relevant to the assistance, closure, and/or resolution of failing banks.

6. The review highlighted the importance of consultation between regulatory agencies, the need for more realistic assumptions in economic projections, and the inclusion of safeguards in open bank assistance agreements to protect the Bank Insurance Fund. The review also emphasized the importance of early notification of insolvency to consider the full range of resolution alternatives and the use of examiners' assessments as a secondary source to check on the validity of asset valuation review results.

1. The Single Audit Act of 1984 was passed by Congress to address concerns about inadequate oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and local governments. The act required state and local governments that received at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance to have a single audit conducted for that year.

2. The Single Audit Act aimed to promote sound financial management, including effective internal control, and to reduce burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations.

3. The act adopted the single audit concept to help meet the needs of federal agencies for grantee oversight as well as grantees' needs for single, uniformly structured audits.

4. The single audit is an organization-wide financial statement audit that includes the audit of the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and focuses on internal control and the recipient's compliance with laws and regulations governing the federal financial assistance received.

5. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the Single Audit Act of 1984 and established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients, including provisions to extend the law to cover all recipients of federal financial assistance and to provide for timely reporting of audit results.

6. The National Single Audit Sampling Project, conducted by the PCIE, found that approximately 49 percent of single audits were acceptable, while 51 percent had deficiencies that were severe enough to cause the audits to be classified as having limited reliability or being unacceptable.

7. The PCIE report recommended a three-pronged approach to reduce the types of deficiencies noted and improve the quality of single audits, including revising and improving single audit standards, criteria, and guidance, establishing minimum continuing professional education (CPE) as a prerequisite for auditors, and reviewing and enhancing the disciplinary processes to address unacceptable audits.

8. The GAO supports the recommendations made in the PCIE report and believes that actions must be taken to improve audit quality and the overall accountability provided through single audits for federal awards, and that considering size characteristics when implementing future actions to improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits may be beneficial.

2. The Social Security Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) allow Medicare to deviate from the standard contracting process, but this has resulted in a lack of competition and flexibility in the program's contracting.

3. The number of contractors willing to serve as Medicare contractors has declined significantly since 1980, leaving the program with fewer choices when one contractor withdraws or is terminated, and the need to broaden the pool of entities allowed to be contractors has increased.

4. Allowing Medicare to have separate contractors for specific claims administration activities, known as functional contracting, could improve program management and lead to greater efficiency and better performance.

5. Implementing performance-based contracting, where contractors are paid based on their performance rather than costs, could also lead to improved program operations and lower administrative costs, but this would require changes to the Social Security Act.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requested the Defense Science Board (DSB) to identify DOD activities that the private sector could do more efficiently and determine the expected savings from outsourcing.

2. The DSB estimated that DOD could realize savings of 30 to 40 percent of logistics costs and achieve broad improvements in service delivery and responsiveness by outsourcing support services traditionally done by government personnel. However, the Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) directorate assessed the DSB's savings estimates and found that they were overstated by about $1 billion and that another $3 billion in projected savings would be difficult to achieve or unlikely to be achieved.

3. The DSB's savings estimates were based on several assumptions, including a 25-percent savings rate from outsourcing, which appears to be overly optimistic. The DSB also assumed that DOD would overcome impediments that prevent the outsourcing of all logistics functions, but these impediments, including legal and cultural barriers, must be overcome to fully implement the DSB's recommendations.

4. The General Accounting Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Defense require the development of a detailed implementation plan for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of DOD's logistics infrastructure, including reengineering, consolidating, outsourcing logistics activities where appropriate, and reducing excess infrastructure. The plan should establish time frames for identifying and evaluating alternative support options and implementing the most cost-effective solutions and identify required resources, including personnel and funding, for accomplishing the cost-reduction initiatives.

6. The Bureau's cost projections for the 2010 Census continue an escalating trend, with the estimated cost increasing by 29 percent from 2000 levels, and the average cost per housing unit increasing by nearly five and a half times greater than the 1970 Census.

7. The Bureau's life cycle cost estimates were updated in April 2003 after being first presented in June 2001, and the Bureau has taken several positive steps to correct problems encountered planning past censuses.

8. However, the Bureau's 2010 planning process still contains certain weak points, including a lack of a comprehensive project plan, incomplete data on the performance of key census activities, and uncertainties over ACS.

9. The Bureau needs to improve the transparency of the fiscal exposure associated with the census, including providing an updated estimate of the life cycle costs of the census and the amount of money the Bureau expects to spend in each year of the cycle.

10. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ensure that the Bureau improves the transparency of the fiscal exposure associated with the census and that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to improve the rigor of its planning process by developing an operational plan that consolidates budget, methodological, and other relevant information into a single, comprehensive project plan.

1. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has established a framework to ensure the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries' protected health information (PHI) when data on prescription drug use are used for purposes other than direct clinical care. This framework includes regulations, outreach, and enforcement activities to protect PHI, including prescription drug use information, and to promote public awareness of the uses and disclosures of PHI.

2. However, despite this framework, there are still risks that covered entities are not properly implementing the standards set by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and that PHI is not properly stripped of all identifiers that would identify an individual. Specifically, HHS has not issued required implementation guidance to assist entities in de-identifying PHI, and OCR has not fully established a capability to proactively monitor covered entities' compliance through the use of periodic audits as required by the HITECH Act.

1. The Military Health Services System (MHSS) spends over $15 billion annually and its main mission is medical readiness, which requires providing medical support to active-duty military personnel and maintaining their health during peacetime.

2. The MHSS has a surplus of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to meet its readiness requirements, and training psychologists to prescribe medication does not give them all the skills needed to substitute for psychiatrists.

3. The Prescribing Psychologists Demonstration Project (PDP) was established to train military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication, but it faced several problems, including a lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, and unresolved issues involving supervision.

4. The PDP increased the number of MHSS mental health care providers who may prescribe drugs, but its cost-effectiveness is unclear, and determining the cost-effectiveness of this effort would require information on the proportion of time prescribing psychologists would have to perform functions that psychiatrists would normally perform.

5. The PDP's annual life cycle cost per full-time equivalent (FTE) was estimated to be lower than that of a psychiatrist-psychologist combination, but the validity of this prediction depends on the realism of the cost estimates and assumptions used.

6. The MHSS has no current or upcoming need for clinical psychologists who may prescribe medication, as it has more psychiatrists than needed to meet medical readiness requirements, and spending resources to produce more providers than needed is hard to justify.

7. The PDP's implementation faced several problems, and given the MHSS's readiness requirements, the PDP's substantial cost, and its questionable benefits, there is no reason to reinstate this demonstration project, and the Congress should require DOD to clearly demonstrate the use of prescribing psychologists has resulted in savings and define their role and scope of practice.

1. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large deployable, infrared-optimized space telescope and the scientific successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope. It is designed to find the first stars and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their current formation.

2. JWST is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope, with a 6.5-meter primary mirror and a multi-layered tennis-court-sized sunshield to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat.

3. The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment, with a complex development effort that incorporates nine critical technologies and 15 pre-existing technologies.

4. The project has experienced significant increases to project costs and schedule delays, with cost estimates ranging from $1 billion to $3.5 billion and expected launch dates ranging from 2007 to 2011.

5. The project has used more than 30 percent of its schedule reserve established at the time of the replan in 2011 to address technical challenges, and the use of schedule reserve on any element or major subsystem may reduce the overall project schedule reserve.

6. The project has relied on three contractors: Northrop Grumman, Harris, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), with Northrop Grumman playing the largest role in developing the sunshield, the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), the spacecraft, and a cooling subsystem for the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).

7. The project has conducted a cost risk analysis of the Northrop Grumman contract, but it does not plan to periodically update it, and the analysis has some weaknesses due to not fully following best practices.

8. The project lacks an independent surveillance mechanism to monitor contractors' earned value management (EVM) data, which has led to anomalies in the data, and the project relies partially on unreliable information to inform its cost and schedule decision-making.

2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates around 15,000 facilities under the Clean Air Act, which must prepare a risk management plan (RMP) to prevent and prepare for accidental releases.

3. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is developing a plan to protect the chemical sector, which will establish a framework for reducing the overall vulnerability of the sector in partnership with the industry and state and local authorities.

4. DHS has identified 3,400 chemical facilities that pose the greatest hazard to human life and health in the event of a terrorist attack, and is developing a new risk assessment methodology to compare and prioritize all critical infrastructure assets.

5. Industry associations, such as the American Chemistry Council (ACC), have been active in promoting security among member companies, but the extent of participation in voluntary initiatives is unclear.

6. Chemical industry officials face challenges in preparing facilities against a terrorist attack, including the cost of security improvements and the need for guidance on what level of security is adequate.

7. Existing laws give DHS limited authority to address chemical sector security, and the agency lacks specific authority to require all high-risk facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and take corrective actions.

8. DHS has concluded that its existing authorities do not allow it to effectively regulate chemical sector security, and has called for legislation creating security requirements at chemical facilities.

9. Several legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress to give the federal government a greater role in ensuring the protection of the nation's chemical facilities, including requiring chemical facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement security measures.

2. The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies' collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records, requiring agencies to notify the public when establishing or making changes to a system of records.

3. The act defines a ""record"" as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains their name or another personal identifier.

4. The E-Government Act of 2002 requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA) before developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates information in a personally identifiable form.

5. DHS has established a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee its implementation of privacy protections, as directed by the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

6. DHS faces challenges in ensuring that privacy concerns are addressed early, reassessed when key programmatic changes are made, and thoroughly reflected in guidance on emerging technologies and uses of personal data.

7. Data mining raises concerns about the impact on personal privacy, including improper access or disclosure of personal information, erroneous associations of individuals with undesirable activities, and misuse of data collected for other purposes.

8. DHS did not conduct a PIA as it developed the ADVISE tool, which is intended to help detect threatening activities by facilitating the analysis of large amounts of data, and is currently in the process of testing its effectiveness.

9. TSA's development of passenger prescreening programs, such as Secure Flight, has raised concerns about privacy, including the use of commercial data without proper notice and the potential for secondary use of information.

1. The Social Security program provides benefits to over 49 million beneficiaries, including retirees, disabled workers, and dependents, with the majority of benefits going to retirees. The program is financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis, but is expected to face cash deficits starting in 2017, with the DI trust fund projected to be depleted by 2026 and the OASI trust fund by 2042.

2. Various reform elements have been proposed to improve the solvency of the Social Security program, including longevity indexing, price indexing, progressive price indexing, increasing the full retirement age, and reducing the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). These reforms would generally reduce benefits from their currently scheduled levels, with some proposals affecting disabled workers and dependents more than others.

3. Protecting the benefits of disabled workers and dependents could be achieved through various options, including full and partial exemptions, a super COLA, and increasing the family maximum. However, these protections come at a cost to the Social Security program's solvency and may create incentives for people to apply for the Disability Insurance program or disincentives for some to return to work.

The program provided various forms of assistance to financial institutions, including capital investments, loan guarantees, and asset purchases. As of September 30, 2014, Treasury had recovered $226.4 billion in repayments and income from its CPP investments, exceeding the amount originally disbursed by $21.5 billion.

2. The TARP-funded housing programs, including the Making Home Affordable (MHA) program, have provided assistance to homeowners facing financial distress, with a focus on reducing monthly mortgage payments and preventing foreclosures. As of September 30, 2014, Treasury had disbursed approximately $13.7 billion (36 percent) of the $38.5 billion in TARP funds allocated to support housing programs, with the majority going towards the MHA program.

3. The TARP programs have undergone significant changes and wind-downs since their inception, with some programs, such as the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), showing positive results, while others, like the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), have been effectively wound down. Treasury continues to evaluate the status of remaining programs and has taken steps to improve oversight and accountability, including the implementation of new regulations and guidelines.

1. In the United States, coal-fueled electricity generating units provide a large share of the electricity produced, with 1,309 units in 2012, accounting for 29% of the total net summer generating capacity. Historically, coal-fueled units have provided about half of the electricity produced in the country.

2. To address concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste, several environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, were enacted. The EPA has proposed or finalized four key regulations that will affect coal-fueled units, which have potentially significant implications for public health and the environment.

3. The EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) regulation was finalized in February 2012 and calls for a 3-year compliance period for existing generating units, with a deadline of April 16, 2015. The regulation requires a 75% reduction in mercury emissions from coal-fueled electricity generating units.

4. The EPA has taken initial steps to implement the recommendation to establish a joint process to monitor industry's progress in responding to the four EPA regulations. However, stakeholders, including a FERC Commissioner, continue to express concerns about reliability and electricity prices.

5. Power companies have already identified retirements beyond the range of estimates reported in 2012, with about 13% of coal-fueled net summer generating capacity (42,192 MW) retired or planned to be retired from 2012 through 2025. The units that power companies have retired or plan to retire are generally older, smaller, and more polluting.

6. The electricity sector is in the midst of a significant transition as power companies face decisions on the future of coal-fueled electricity generating units in light of new regulations and changes in the market. The federal agencies, including DOE, EPA, and FERC, will continue to monitor the progress of industry implementation of the regulations and coordinate with one another to address potential reliability challenges.

1. The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) field offices do not systematically determine the eligibility of estates kept open for more than 2 years, as regulations require, which can lead to improper payments to deceased individuals.

2. FSA conducted annual eligibility determinations for only 39 out of 181 estates reviewed, and even when determinations were made, they were often done poorly, with insufficient information or vague explanations.

3. The lack of management controls, such as computer matching with the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, makes it difficult for FSA to prevent improper payments to deceased individuals, with $1.1 billion in farm program payments made to 172,801 deceased individuals from 1999 to 2005.

4. Complex farming operations, such as corporations and general partnerships, increase the potential for improper payments, with 57% of deceased individuals who received farm program payments through entities being listed as members of corporations or general partnerships.

5. FSA officials acknowledged that a lack of sufficient personnel and time, as well as competing priorities, contributed to the failure to conduct or thoroughly conduct eligibility determinations, but have begun taking steps to recover improper payments.

6. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that USDA conduct all required annual estate eligibility determinations, implement management controls to verify the eligibility of individuals receiving program payments, and recover improper payments, which USDA agreed to and has begun implementing.

2. The Advanced Automation System (AAS) was restructured in 1994 after estimated costs tripled from $2.5 billion to $7.6 billion, and delays in putting significantly less-than-promised system capabilities into operation were expected to run 8 years or more over original estimates.

3. The FAA has fielded some equipment, such as a new voice communications system, but delays in other projects have caused the agency to implement costly interim projects, and it is still having difficulties in acquiring new systems within agreed-to schedule and cost parameters.

4. The FAA has identified some of the root causes of long-standing problems with its modernization and has recommended solutions to them, including the lack of a complete and enforced systems architecture, unreliable cost information, lack of mature software acquisition processes, and an organizational culture that does not always act in the agency's long-term best interest.

5. The FAA has begun to implement many of the recommended solutions, but it will need to stay focused on continued improvement, and the agency is considering recommendations to create a new structure, including the establishment of a single NAS manager at the level of associate administrator to eliminate traditional ""stovepipes"" between the acquisition and air traffic organizations.

6. The FAA faces both opportunities and challenges as it revises the modernization program, including the need to expedite the deployment of key technologies while avoiding repeating past practices, such as undue concern for schedules at the expense of disciplined systems development and careful, thorough testing.

7. The FAA must also address the looming crisis with the year 2000 date requirements, which could cause computer systems worldwide to malfunction or produce inaccurate information, and the agency has been severely behind schedule in completing basic awareness and assessment activities, critical first and second phases in an effective year 2000 program.

2. The franchise funds, such as GovWorks and FedSource, are government-run, self-supporting businesslike enterprises managed by federal employees and are required to recover their full costs of doing business.

3. The franchise funds charge fees for services, with GovWorks' fees ranging from 2 percent to 4 percent of the price for goods and services purchased, and FedSource fees ranging from 2 percent to 8 percent.

4. DOD customers chose to use franchise funds based on convenience, rather than as part of an acquisition plan, and did not conduct analysis to determine whether using franchise funds' contracting services was the best method for acquiring a particular good or service.

5. GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures, did not ensure fair and reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings on behalf of DOD customers for millions of dollars worth of goods and services.

6. The franchise funds' business operating principles require that they maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors, but they did not perform analyses that DOD could use to assess whether the franchise funds deliver good value.

7. GovWorks and FedSource relied on administrative staff, not contracting officers, to work with customers to define and assign specific tasks to be performed or positions to be filled, which led to inadequacies in their contracting practices.

8. The franchise funds often relied on methods of contract oversight that lacked performance measures to ensure that contractors provided quality goods and services in a timely manner, and did not include an oversight plan that contained specific quality criteria in their contracts or orders.

9. To improve the franchise funds' contracting activities, the GAO recommends that DOD, the Interior, the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget take actions to ensure that DOD customers analyze alternatives when choosing franchise funds, and that the franchise funds adhere to sound contracting practices.

The financial condition of these plans depends on adequate contributions from employers and employees, as well as prudent investments that preserve principal and yield an adequate rate of return over time.

2. Pension fiduciaries invest in various asset classes, including stocks and bonds, and may also invest in other asset classes or trading strategies, such as hedge funds and private equity. Private sector pension plan investment decisions must comply with the provisions of ERISA, which stipulates fiduciary standards based on the principle of a prudent man standard.

3. Pension plans face challenges in hedge fund investing, including specific investment risks, limited transparency and liquidity, and risks related to the operations of the hedge fund. To mitigate these risks, plans take steps such as conducting due diligence, negotiating important investment terms, and investing through funds of funds.

4. Private equity investments pose several distinct challenges, including the concentration of underlying holdings, use of leverage, and wide variation in performance among funds. Plans mitigate these challenges by investing with top-performing funds, diversifying their investments, and staggering investments over several years.

5. The federal government does not specifically limit or monitor private sector pension investments in hedge funds or private equity, and state approaches for public plans vary. ERISA requires that plan fiduciaries meet general standards of prudent investing, but does not impose specific limits on investments in hedge funds or private equity.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the program, overseeing cleanups performed by responsible parties and performing cleanups itself.

2. State governments also have a role in the Superfund process, entering into contracts or cooperative agreements with EPA to carry out certain Superfund actions, including evaluating sites, cleaning them up, and overseeing the cleanups.

3. As of November 1998, the Superfund program had investigated over 40,000 potential hazardous waste sites and made final decisions about whether or not to include almost 35,000 sites on the National Priorities List (NPL).

4. The EPA's CERCLIS database indicates that as of October 8, 1997, 3,036 sites were potentially eligible for the NPL on the basis of a combination of criteria, including a preliminary hazardous ranking system score of 28.5 or above and the completion of a site inspection or the initiation of an expanded site inspection.

5. Our surveys of officials of EPA regions, states, and federal agencies indicate that 1,789 of the 3,036 sites classified by EPA's database as awaiting a National Priorities List decision are potentially eligible for the list, while another 1,234 sites are unlikely to become eligible for the Superfund program.

6. The 1,789 potentially eligible sites include 1,739 nonfederal sites and 50 federal facilities, with 686 sites having some cleanup activities taking place or currently being conducted, but the final cleanup remedy is not yet under way, and 1,103 sites for which no substantive cleanup activities have been reported or no information on cleanup progress is available.

7. Our surveys indicate that many of the potentially eligible sites pose risks to human health or the environment, with most threatening drinking water sources or groundwater, and being generally located in populated areas.

8. The EPA and states are uncertain about what cleanup actions will be taken at more than half of the potentially eligible sites, and timely action is needed to obtain the information required to assess the sites' risks, set priorities for cleanups, and assign responsibility to EPA or the states for arranging the cleanups.

2. The visa process includes several steps, including documentation reviews, in-person interviews, collection of biometrics (fingerprints), and cross-referencing an applicant's name against the Consular Lookout and Support System.

3. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress, State, and DHS have initiated new policies and procedures to strengthen the security of the visa process, which have added to the complexity of consular officers' workload.

4. The State Department has implemented various measures to address visa wait times, including providing temporary duty staff to assist in adjudicating visas at several locations with long wait times and relocating consular positions to locations where large disparities in staff and visa demand were apparent.

5. Despite these efforts, State's current consular staffing efforts are generally temporary, nonsustainable, and insufficient to meet the expected increases in demand at some posts.

6. The State Department has also taken steps to improve consular facilities, but it is unclear whether the facilities will be adequate to handle the future demand, with some posts already predicting that future increased demand will outstrip visa processing capacities.

7. The State Department has not developed a strategy for addressing increasing visa demand that balances available resources and the need for national security in the visa process against its goal that visas are processed in a reasonable amount of time.

8. The State Department has contracted with an independent consulting firm to analyze factors that affect visa demand, but the study's projections have already been proven to underestimate growth in demand, and the department has not taken action to update the study.

9. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of State develop a strategy to address worldwide increases in visa demand, improve the reliability and utility of visa waits data, and identify practices and procedures used by posts to manage workload and reduce wait times.

2. OPM's retirement modernization initiative, RetireEZ, aims to automate and modernize the retirement processing system, but the agency has faced significant challenges in implementing the program. The initiative was initially expected to provide prompt and complete benefit payments, but the agency has struggled to meet this goal due to various management weaknesses.

3. OPM has identified several factors that limit its ability to process retirement benefits in an efficient and timely manner, including the use of paper-based and manually intensive processes, high costs and limited capabilities of existing information systems, and a lack of qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated retirement systems.

4. The agency has made some progress in implementing the RetireEZ program, including the partial implementation of an integrated database of retirement information and improvements to customer service. However, six other key capabilities have not been implemented, and the agency has not yet developed a complete plan for the restructured program.

5. To address the management weaknesses and improve the effectiveness of the retirement modernization initiative, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Personnel Management provide immediate attention to ensure that the agency develops a complete plan for the restructured program, establishes a reliable cost estimate, and develops a requirements management plan, among other actions.

1. Over the last two decades, the number of school-aged children with limited English proficiency in the United States has grown dramatically, increasing from less than 1 million in 1980 to more than 3.5 million in 1998. This growth has led to a significant increase in the enrollment of school-aged children with limited English proficiency across the country.

2. The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 to educate students with limited English proficiency, and it has been reauthorized several times since then. The 1994 reauthorization created four bilingual education grant programs: Program Development and Implementation Grants (PDI), Program Enhancement Projects (Enhancement), Comprehensive School Grants (Comprehensive), and Systemwide Improvement Grants (Systemwide).

3. The four bilingual education programs share the same performance goals and measures, possess similar eligibility criteria, and allow similar uses of program funds. They target students with limited English proficiency in kindergarten through 12th grade and aim to provide bilingual or special alternative education programs to help such children reach high academic standards.

4. Despite the efforts of the four bilingual education programs, the effectiveness of these programs on a national level is unknown due to the lack of comparable data. The BEA requires local assessments of student outcomes, but the choice of assessment tests and definitions of terms vary among school districts, making it difficult to aggregate data and measure program effectiveness.

5. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends consolidating the four bilingual education programs into one program to reduce overlap and inefficiencies. This consolidation would allow the Department of Education to redirect resources to other activities, such as conducting site visits, reviewing grant applications, and providing technical assistance, and would also benefit grantees by reducing the administrative burden associated with applying to multiple federal programs.

2. As of January 1, 2011, NCIC contained 85,820 active records in its missing persons file, and over 92,000 law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice partners have access to NCIC.

3. The FBI's CJIS Division and state and local agencies that access the system manage NCIC cooperatively, with an Advisory Process consisting of an Advisory Policy Board and working groups responsible for establishing policy and providing advice and guidance on all CJIS Division programs.

4. Local level governance of NCIC use is performed by the CSA, a criminal justice agency that has overall responsibility for the administration and usage of NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and assuring LEA compliance with operating procedures.

5. CJIS shares with the CSAs the responsibility for monitoring compliance with NCIC policy, including conducting triennial audits of each CSA to assess compliance with NCIC policies, including the 2-hour entry requirement for reports of missing children.

6. However, the audit approaches used by the 6 selected CSAs to assess compliance with the 2-hour entry requirement varied, and CJIS officials acknowledged that CSA audits would be more useful if they measured LEAs' compliance with the 2-hour criterion and reviewed a sample of missing children records.

7. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Director of the FBI direct CJIS to consider establishing minimum standards for assessing compliance with timely entry requirements, including applying the 2-hour criterion and how to sample missing children records, and that the Director of the FBI and the Administrator of OJJDP consider opportunities to use existing mechanisms to obtain information on the extent to which LEAs face challenges in reporting missing children to NCIC.

1. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has the lead role in federal government efforts to reduce the number of traffic crashes and minimize their consequences. Automobiles have been associated with nearly 29,000 traffic fatalities annually in the United States, including the deaths of both automobile occupants and others involved in collisions with automobiles.

2. The report focuses on the most important predictors of occupant injury in a collision: crash type and crash severity, automobile size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender. The report is concerned with both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles).

3. The study found that crash severity is the most important predictor of driver hospitalization or death, followed by crash type, safety belt use, driver age and gender, and automobile weight. The study also found that women drivers are more likely than men drivers to be hospitalized or killed in collisions with cars and light trucks, but not in one-car crashes.

4. The study suggests that improving the crash protection offered by automobiles to women and older drivers so that it approaches the level enjoyed by men and younger drivers offers the greatest chance for reducing roadway injuries for them. The study also recommends that NHTSA's implementation of the requirement for air bags may not achieve the greatest degree of improvement in the aggregate safety of the population of automobile occupants, and that requiring both air bags and automatic lap and shoulder safety belts may be a better proposal.

3. The Coast Guard's performance measures are published in various documents, including the Budget-in-Brief, which reports performance information to assess the effectiveness of the agency's performance and provide information for the budgeting process.

4. The Coast Guard has programs to acquire assets such as vessels, aircraft, and command, control, communications, computer, intelligence surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, including the 25-year, $24 billion Deepwater program to upgrade or replace existing vessels and aircraft.

5. The Coast Guard's fiscal year 2008 budget request is $8.73 billion, with a 3.3 percent increase from fiscal year 2007, and a focus on reorganizing internal operations and support command infrastructure, rather than new acquisitions.

6. The Coast Guard is facing challenges in managing the Deepwater program, including technical design issues, funding uncertainties, and changes to the program's scope and schedule, which have led to delays and cost overruns.

7. The Coast Guard is also facing maintenance challenges with its polar icebreaking capability, with two Polar-class icebreakers reaching the end of their design service lives, and plans to refurbish or replace them, with estimated costs ranging from $552 million to $859 million or $600 million per vessel, respectively.

2. The program involves a complex process of qualifying carriers, soliciting rates, distributing moves, evaluating moving companies' performance, paying invoices, and settling claims, and has faced challenges such as ensuring adequate year-round capacity, especially during the summer peak moving season.

3. In response to recommendations to improve the quality of household goods moves for servicemembers, DOD developed a new program called Families First, which aims to improve the quality of service from moving companies, streamline the claims process, and develop an integrated information management system.

4. The Families First program has faced delays in developing and implementing the Defense Personal Property System (DPS), a new information management system that is critical to achieving the program's goals, and has pushed back the original estimated release date for DPS by more than 2 years.

5. DOD has developed a backup plan to provide servicemembers with full replacement value coverage by March 1, 2008, but this plan relies on a legacy system that is no longer fully supportable and may not be able to handle the increased workload and complexity of the program.

6. The Families First program is estimated to increase costs to DOD by about $1.4 billion over current program costs through fiscal year 2011, primarily due to the increased cost of implementing DPS and the expected 13 percent cost increase to the services' household goods budgets.

7. DOD faces management challenges in implementing the Families First program, including staffing shortfalls, organizational changes, and a lack of stakeholders' agreement on some elements of the program, which puts the implementation of the program at risk.

Tobacco is a high-value, pesticide-intensive crop, ranking sixth in terms of pesticide application per acre in the United States, and is grown in 16 states, with Kentucky and North Carolina producing about two-thirds of all domestic tobacco. The crop is also grown in over 100 countries, with the United States being the second-largest producer of cigarettes in the world.

2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides used on tobacco, and most of the pesticides used on tobacco are widely used on food and other crops. The EPA assesses and mitigates potential health risks from pesticide residues on tobacco, and has identified 37 pesticides commonly used on tobacco in the United States during the 1990s.

3. The EPA has implemented a tiered approach to evaluating residues on tobacco, which includes plant metabolism studies, field trials, and pyrolysis studies. The agency has also adopted a more formal and consistent approach to evaluating the health risks associated with pesticides used on tobacco, and has started to document its conclusions on the potential for short-term risks from pesticide residues that may remain in tobacco smoke.

4. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) tests imported and domestic tobacco for residues of 20 pesticides not approved for domestic use on tobacco, primarily for purposes of trade equity. The USDA testing program would be improved by assessing the current universe of pesticides not approved for use on tobacco and determining whether an update to its program is warranted, and the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture is recommended to direct the Administrators of the Agricultural Marketing Service and the Farm Service Agency to periodically review and update the pesticides for which they set residue limits and test imported and domestic tobacco.

1. User fees are a type of financing approach for federal programs or activities, where the costs of providing a benefit above and beyond what is normally available to the general public are assigned to readily identifiable users of those programs and activities.

2. User fees can be in the form of user fees, user charges, or excise taxes on certain products, and they are often used to fund programs that primarily benefit identifiable users, such as customers of the U.S. Postal Service.

3. The beneficiary-pays principle is a useful guideline for assigning costs, which states that if a program primarily benefits the general public, it should be supported by general revenue, and if a program primarily benefits identifiable users, it should be funded by fees.

4. Determining a program's beneficiaries and the extent to which a program benefits users, the general public, or both is not usually clear-cut, and agencies should follow OMB guidance to determine which activities and costs should be included and which should not.

5. Fees should be set and adjusted to cover the intended share of costs over time, which means agencies must project and consider future program costs, and they should use reliable cost data to ensure that user fees recover the intended share of costs.

6. Agencies should consider the trade-offs between user-specific fees and systemwide fees, where user-specific fees promote equity and economic efficiency but may be more costly to administer, and systemwide fees may be higher or lower than the actual cost of providing a service to certain types of users.

7. Agencies should also consider the use of exemptions, waivers, and caps to promote certain policy goals, but these provisions can increase cross-subsidies between users and may require more frequent review and updating for the authorized purposes to remain aligned with program needs.

8. Regular reviews and updates of fees are necessary to ensure that the fee remains aligned with program costs, and agencies should provide program information to stakeholders and Congress to improve transparency, help ensure that fees remain aligned with program costs and activities, and increase awareness of the costs of the federal program.

The US government faces significant challenges in its acquisition process, including a lack of clear strategic goals, inadequate consideration of resource limitations, and a tendency to prioritize individual needs over collective needs. This can lead to poor acquisition outcomes, such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and reduced capabilities.

2. The government's reliance on contractors has increased, but this has also introduced new risks, including the potential for conflicts of interest, inadequate oversight, and poor contract management. The use of contractors has also led to a shortage of skilled acquisition professionals within the government.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) establishes a standard price per barrel for fuel to be charged to its customers, which is set annually by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) based on three components: crude oil price, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs.

2. The crude oil price is forecasted by the Council of Economic Advisors, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and DOD uses the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) projection as its baseline. However, DOD's current approach for establishing the standard price has not accounted for changes in market conditions for crude oil.

3. DOD's estimated fuel costs have differed considerably from its actual costs in recent years, with actual prices differing from DOD's estimates largely because changes in fuel market conditions have not been reflected in the standard price. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, designed to absorb the effects of price fluctuations, has been insufficient to absorb the significant net outlays for fuel.

4. DOD has not reevaluated its approach to setting the standard price since 2007, despite the recurring need for transfers and price adjustments. To improve DOD's process for setting its standard fuel price, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to reevaluate the approach for estimating the components of the standard price and document its assumptions.

5. DOD has partially concurred with the GAO's recommendation, stating that it is continually evaluating methods to better estimate the price of fuel, but has not specified any specific initiatives to that end. The GAO believes that reevaluating its approach for estimating the components of the standard price would allow DOD to develop more-informed estimates and better position the department to minimize risks and uncertainty resulting from changing market conditions.

1. The Department of Defense's (DOD) Standard Procurement System (SPS) is a major acquisition program aimed at providing a single automated system for contract management-related functions. However, the program has faced significant challenges, including delays, cost overruns, and user dissatisfaction.

2. The SPS program was initiated in 1994 to acquire and deploy a single automated system to perform all contract management-related functions within DOD's procurement process. The program was expected to be fully operational by March 31, 2000, but this date has slipped by 3-½ years and is likely to slip further.

3. The SPS program has not met key commitments, including the timing of product delivery, user satisfaction with system performance, and the use of a commercial system solution. The program has also failed to standardize procurement business practices and data elements throughout DOD.

4. The SPS program has been criticized for its lack of functionality, complexity, and inadequate training, which has resulted in users developing inefficient workarounds. The program has also been criticized for its cost-effectiveness, with some estimates suggesting that the program may not produce a positive net present value.

5. The DOD Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has issued three reports critical of the SPS program, highlighting its lack of functionality, complexity, and inadequate training. The OIG has also raised concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the program and the department's reliance on a single vendor.

6. The SPS program has not been economically justified, with the latest economic analysis showing that estimated costs exceed expected program benefits. The analysis also highlights a return-on-investment calculation that does not include all relevant costs, such as the costs to be incurred by DOD components.

7. The DOD has not measured whether the incremental software releases have produced expected business value, and the program manager has stated that knowing whether SPS is producing value is not the program office's objective. The program has also not validated whether return-on-investment projections are being met.

3. USCIS has a budget of just under $1.8 billion, with about $1.6 billion from service fees and $160 million from congressionally appropriated funds, and has a plan to eliminate its backlog of several million applications by the end of fiscal year 2006.

4. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003 led to the transition of immigration services and enforcement functions from the former INS to different organizations within DHS, with USCIS assuming immigration benefit functions and ICE assuming investigative and detention functions.

5. USCIS established the Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) office in 2003 to enhance its fraud control efforts, which includes developing, coordinating, and leading national antifraud operations, identifying vulnerabilities in policies and procedures, and recommending solutions and internal controls.

6. FDNS has conducted a series of fraud assessments to determine the extent and nature of fraud for certain immigration benefits, including a preliminary finding of potential fraud in about 33% of sampled religious worker applications.

7. USCIS has taken some important steps to detect immigration benefit fraud, including establishing FDNS, conducting fraud assessments, and implementing a strategy for detecting immigration benefit fraud, but has not yet implemented some aspects of internal control standards and fraud control best practices.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) assessed the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) performance during the 1994 filing season, focusing on its ability to process income tax returns and refunds accurately and efficiently, and provide taxpayers with access to forms, information, and electronic filing methods.

2. The GAO validated the results of a service center's test of refund accuracy and timeliness by reviewing 853 randomly selected refunds, and analyzed filing season-related data from IRS' Management Information System for Top Level Executives and IRS data on processing errors.

3. The GAO found that IRS' computer systems generally performed well during the 1994 filing season, with some systems problems causing minor delays, but overall, the number of individual income tax returns filed increased, and more taxpayers used alternative filing methods like electronic filing.

4. However, the GAO identified several problems, including the Earned Income Credit (EIC) continuing to be a leading source of errors by taxpayers and tax practitioners, and the number of fraudulent refund claims identified by IRS growing at a troubling pace.

5. The GAO also found that taxpayers experienced difficulty reaching IRS by telephone, with the accessibility of IRS' toll-free telephone assistance declining, and taxpayers calling IRS to order forms and taxpayers trying to use the TeleFile system also had problems getting through.

6. The GAO conducted two limited tests of the level of service IRS provides to taxpayers seeking copies of tax forms and publications, and found that taxpayers were likely to find tax materials they needed if they visited a walk-in site, but had to be persistent to order materials over the telephone.

7. The GAO noted that the EIC continues to be a problem area for IRS and taxpayers, and that the situation may only worsen in 1995 as more people become eligible to claim the credit.

1. The rapid increase in crack cocaine use in the 1980s was referred to as a drug epidemic, and researchers and government agencies look for changing patterns in drug use to identify emerging drug use problems. These patterns include the use of a new illicit drug, a change in how a drug is taken, a change in the level of use of an existing drug, and the use of a drug by a new population group or in a different geographic area.

2. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) sponsored several surveys and convened a work group of epidemiologists to help identify and monitor changes in drug use patterns, but limitations in the drug detection mechanisms used by NIDA hindered the identification and monitoring of drug use activity in many geographic areas and for some high-risk populations.

3. The federal public health response to crack in the 1980s primarily focused on cocaine in general instead of on crack specifically, and NIDA's research was aimed at developing ""best practice"" prevention and treatment approaches. However, NIDA did not initially target its education and outreach efforts to address the use of crack, and it was not until the late 1980s that NIDA began to focus on crack specifically.

4. Despite changes to federal drug detection mechanisms and congressional efforts to better position federal public health agencies to respond to emerging drug crises, concerns remain about the overall efficiency and effectiveness of these efforts, and a more defined strategy for responding to emerging drug use problems is needed, including a systematic approach for gathering drug-related data and better linkages with state and local entities to capitalize on their experiences with local drug crises or epidemics.

1. The American economy underwent significant structural changes in the mid-1970s, leading to the dislocation of thousands of workers from their jobs due to advances in technology, international competition, plant closings, and corporate streamlining.

2. In the 1980s and early 1990s, demonstration projects were conducted in New Jersey, Nevada, Minnesota, and Washington to identify those likely to experience long periods of joblessness using statistical methods and administrative data.

3. The New Jersey and Minnesota projects showed the efficacy of using statistical methods and administrative data to identify those who are likely to experience long periods of joblessness, and providing more intensive job search assistance to this population reduced the duration of insured unemployment and UI expenditures.

4. In response to these events, the Clinton administration proposed legislation to implement worker profiling in 1993, and Congress enacted the Unemployment Compensation Amendments, amending the Unemployment Insurance program legislation.

5. The law requires states to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation, identify those claimants that will be likely to exhaust regular compensation, and refer them to reemployment services.

6. Labor issued guidance to help states establish profiling tools and provide necessary reemployment services, considering factors such as whether the claimant has a date for being recalled to work, union status, first unemployment benefit payment, and previous industry or occupation of employment.

7. The large majority of states use statistical models to identify unemployment recipients who are most likely to exhaust benefits, but many states have not recently adjusted their models, risking the possibility that these models may lose predictive accuracy over time.

8. Labor encourages the use of statistical models over characteristic screens because they are more efficient and precise in identifying claimants likely to exhaust benefits, but states can vary in how they specifically define exhaustion.

9. The worker-profiling initiative has been in place for over 20 years, but little is known about its current effectiveness, and research studies used data from the early implementation of the initiative, which may not reflect what states are currently offering.

10. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that the Secretary of Labor reevaluate the agency's worker-profiling data collection, ensure the accuracy of state profiling models, encourage states to adhere to Labor's vision for in-depth reemployment services, and evaluate the impact of the worker-profiling program on the reemployment of UI recipients.

The program aimed to improve access to care and reduce costs, but it ultimately resulted in higher costs for DOD due to the high utilization of services by enrollees.

2. The demonstration was authorized by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 and was designed to test the feasibility of a Medicare subvention model, where DOD would provide care to Medicare-eligible retirees and CMS would pay DOD a capitated rate for each enrollee. However, the program's payment rules, which required DOD to maintain its level of effort (LOE) in providing care to older retirees, resulted in Medicare owing DOD nothing for care provided in 1999, and DOD incurred greater costs to support the program, which were covered by redirecting funds from other uses.

To address these challenges, DOD and Congress have established several ""technology transition"" programs, including the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program, the Manufacturing Technology Program (MANTECH), and the Dual Use Science and Technology program.

3. Three new transition programs, the Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and the Quick Reaction Fund, were established in 2003 to speed the transition of technologies developed by DOD's S&T programs into acquisition programs. These programs received about $64 million in fiscal year 2005, a fraction of the $9.2 billion DOD invested in applied research and advanced technology development that year.

4. The three transition programs have reported benefits, including improvements to performance, affordability, manufacturability, and operational capability for the warfighter. However, it is too early to determine the impact of these programs on technology transition, and only 11 of 68 projects started in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 had been completed, with only 4 currently available to warfighters.

5. To ensure successful transition, transition programs need to establish effective selection, management, and oversight processes, including the use of technology readiness levels (TRLs) to assess the maturity level of a technology. The DACP program has a fairly robust selection process, while the TTI program has a fairly rigorous selection process, but the Quick Reaction Fund's selection process was less structured and disciplined.

6. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense take five actions to strengthen the transition programs, including developing data and measures to support assessments of the performance of the three transition programs, developing formal feedback mechanisms, implementing formal agreements to solidify up-front technology development agreements, confirming technology readiness levels as part of the proposal acceptance process, and assessing how the Technology Transition Council can be better used.

1. The Master Address File (MAF) is a data file containing a list of all known living quarters in the United States and Puerto Rico, used by the Bureau to support the decennial census and other demographic surveys.

2. The Bureau plans to conduct targeted address canvassing for the 2020 Census, verifying addresses in select areas that are more likely to require updates to the address list, and increasing its reliance on other sources of updates, including U.S. Postal Service files and commercial database files.

3. The Bureau's 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules exhibit some characteristics of a reliable schedule, but important weaknesses remain, including a lack of comprehensiveness, well-construction, and credibility.

4. The Bureau's schedules lack critical information, such as resource needs and availability, and do not include logic about preceding and following activities, making it difficult to identify the schedules' critical path.

5. The Bureau has not conducted a quantitative risk analysis on its schedule, which would help to illustrate the impact of risks on the schedule and provide a measure of how much time contingency should be built in the schedule.

6. The Bureau has put in place a framework to support collaborative efforts, including planning documents, memorandums of understanding, and charters, but has not taken advantage of some opportunities to use its schedules to reinforce roles or clarify responsibilities.

7. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Commerce and Undersecretary of Economic Affairs direct the U.S. Census Bureau to improve its scheduling practices in three areas: comprehensiveness, construction, and credibility, and that the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau initiate a robust workforce planning process for those working on schedules related to the Master Address File.

1. The Clean Air Act, a comprehensive federal law, was passed in 1963 to regulate air pollution from stationary and mobile sources, and was substantially overhauled in 1970 to establish national ambient air quality standards for pollutants. The act was amended again in 1977 and 1990, with the 1990 amendments incorporating market-based approaches to reduce emissions.

2. The Clean Air Act requires states and local governments to carry out certain portions of the statute, including developing implementation plans to come into compliance with national standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA must approve each state's plan, and if an implementation plan is not acceptable, EPA may assume enforcement of the Clean Air Act in that state.

3. Despite progress in reducing emissions, large numbers of Americans continue to live in communities where pollution sometimes exceeds federal air quality standards for one or more of the six principal air pollutants. EPA has set standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead, and has implemented various programs to reduce emissions and improve air quality.

4. The EPA has completed most of the 452 actions required by the 1990 amendments related to Titles I, III, and IV, but did not meet statutory deadlines for many of the requirements. The agency cited several factors for the delays, including an emphasis on stakeholders' review and involvement during regulatory development, the need to set priorities among the numerous new requirements, and competing demands caused by the workload associated with EPA's responses to lawsuits.

5. The EPA has identified 171 requirements to implement the objectives of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and has completed 146 of them as of April 2005. The agency has also completed almost all of the requirements it identified to fully implement the objectives of Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, but met late for many of the requirements.

6. The EPA has completed 42 of the 44 requirements to meet the objectives of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, but has not completed two requirements that had statutory deadlines that have passed. The agency has decided not to pursue these actions further due to resource limitations and the lack of a clear environmental benefit.

1. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) established the Girls Study Group in 2004 to identify effective programs for preventing and reducing girls' delinquency, and to develop program models to inform communities about what works.

2. The Study Group reviewed over 1,000 documents and identified 61 programs that specifically targeted preventing or responding to girls' delinquency, and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the What Works criteria developed by DOJ's Office of Justice Programs.

3. The Study Group found that few girls' delinquency programs had been studied, and the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs, leading OJJDP to plan to provide technical assistance to help programs prepare for evaluations.

4. The Study Group also found that the majority of the girls' delinquency programs it identified had not been studied by researchers, and for the 17 programs that had been studied, none of the studies provided conclusive evidence of their effectiveness.

5. In response to the Study Group's findings, OJJDP plans to work with the group to provide a technical assistance workshop to help approximately 10 girls' delinquency programs prepare for evaluation, and to issue a solicitation in fiscal year 2010 for funding to support evaluations of girls' delinquency programs.

6. However, OJJDP has not developed a plan to meet its girls' delinquency goals, which is a standard practice for program and project management, and the office is in transition and developing a plan for its juvenile justice programs.

7. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that OJJDP develop and document a plan to articulate how the office intends to respond to the findings of the Study Group, including time frames and specific funding requirements and commitments, and to share the plan with key stakeholders.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) created the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in 1991 to standardize DOD finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems, and to eliminate the costs of maintaining and operating multiple financial operations and systems.

2. Prior to 1991, the military services maintained separate finance and accounting operations that were duplicative and inefficient, resulting in complex, slow, and error-prone business practices. DOD officials believed that consolidating these activities offered a number of potential advantages, including increasing DOD-wide oversight and improving consistency in the application of accounting principles.

3. DFAS was formed by consolidating into a single agency under DOD's Comptroller, the large finance and accounting centers that belonged to the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. By 1994, DFAS had assumed responsibility for many of the finance and accounting activities at 332 offices and had announced plans to consolidate these activities at a limited number of DFAS locations.

4. The military services and defense agencies pay for DFAS services primarily with funds from their operations and maintenance appropriations. DFAS is responsible for reducing the number of finance and accounting systems used throughout DOD, and has reduced the reported number of finance systems from 127 to 67 and accounting systems from 197 to 150.

5. DFAS is responsible for accounting for funds received through congressional appropriations, the sale of goods and services by working capital fund businesses, revenue generated through nonappropriated fund activities, and the sales of military systems and equipment to foreign governments. In fiscal year 1996, DFAS accounted for $338.5 billion in obligated and unobligated balances in general funds monies and $28 billion in obligated and unobligated balances in security assistance funds.

6. DOD finance and accounting personnel are responsible for paying the salaries of DOD employees, paying retirees and annuitants, reimbursing employees for travel-related expenses, paying contractors and vendors for goods and services, and collecting debts owed to DOD. DFAS has the primary responsibility for processing transactions, paying contractors and vendors, and accounting for the disbursement of funds, while military service finance personnel are involved to the extent that they verify that funds are available for use and enter information into accounting systems.

524,"1. The Federal Reserve Act established the Federal Reserve as an independent agency with a decentralized structure to ensure that monetary policy decisions would be based on a broad economic perspective from all regions of the country.

2. The Federal Reserve operates in a unique public and private structure, consisting of the Board of Governors, the 12 Reserve Banks, and the FOMC, with the Board of Governors being an independent regulatory federal agency located in Washington, D.C.

3. The Reserve Banks are not federal agencies but federally chartered corporations with a board of directors and member banks that are stockholders, and they are subject to the general supervision of the Board of Governors, with each Reserve Bank serving a specific district and providing various services and operations.

4. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions are not subject to approval by the President, the executive branch of the government, or Congress, but the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by Congress and conducts monetary policy to promote the long-run objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States.

5. The Federal Reserve's independence is considered relatively high compared to central banks in other advanced economies, with high instrument independence and financial independence, but lower political independence due to existing appointment procedures for the Board of Governors.

6. Modifying the Reserve Bank stock ownership requirement could have a number of policy implications, including disrupting the Federal Reserve's public and private balance, diminishing Reserve Bank autonomy, and potentially undermining the governance of a central bank with a combined private and public structure.",1,{'n_points': 6}

1. The 1992 congressional testimony revealed that thieves turn stolen cars into money in three ways: by dismantling and selling car parts, obtaining a valid title and selling the car, or exporting the vehicles for sale abroad. The 1992 Act aimed to address these issues by establishing a task force, creating a new federal crime for armed car jacking, and implementing a national motor vehicle title information system.

2. The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System was intended to enable states and other users to instantly and reliably determine the validity of title documents, whether an automobile bearing a known identification number is titled in a particular state, and whether an automobile titled in a particular state is junked or salvaged.

3. The task force established in 1993 recommended the passage of federal legislation to require uniform definitions for terms such as salvage vehicles and uniform methods for titling vehicles. However, the task force's recommendations have not been implemented, and NHTSA officials stated that a national titling system should not be implemented until uniformity existed among the states.

4. The 1992 Act also required the establishment of the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System (NSPMVIS), which was to contain vehicle identification numbers and other related data for stolen passenger motor vehicles and parts. However, the implementation of NSPMVIS has been delayed, and the system is still in the pilot study phase.

5. The National Stolen Auto Part Information System (NSAPIS) Federal Advisory Committee recommended that the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) serve as the System Administrator for NSAPIS and that Congress enact legislation establishing an Oversight Committee to work with NICB to develop and maintain NSAPIS.

1. The distribution of and payment for prescription drugs involves interactions among multiple entities, including drug wholesalers, independent pharmacies, Pharmacy Service Administrative Organizations (PSAOs), and third-party payers and their Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). These entities facilitate the flow of and payment for drugs from manufacturers to consumers.

2. Independent pharmacies, which account for almost 34 percent of the retail pharmacies operating in the United States, primarily purchase drugs from wholesalers and rely on PSAOs to negotiate contracts with third-party payers or their PBMs. PSAOs provide a broad range of services to independent pharmacies, including negotiating contractual agreements, providing communication and help-desk services, and assisting with administrative tasks.

3. PSAOs charge a monthly fee for a bundled set of services and separate fees for additional services, and most PSAOs are owned by wholesalers and independent pharmacy cooperatives. The owners of PSAOs vary as to whether they require member pharmacies to also use services from a separate non-PSAO line of business, but most do not.

4. PSAO services create administrative efficiencies for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs, including efficiencies in contracting, payment, and customer service. However, PSAOs must ensure that their arrangements do not unreasonably restrain trade, thereby raising antitrust concerns, and most PSAO owners reported that PSAO services are not a profitable line of business.

1. An enterprise architecture is a blueprint that describes the current and desired state of an organization or functional area in both logical and technical terms, as well as a plan for transitioning between the two states. It is a crucial means to optimize agency operations and performance, and its effective use is a recognized hallmark of successful public and private organizations.

2. The concept of enterprise architectures originated in the mid-1980s, and various frameworks for defining the content of these architectures have been published by government agencies and OMB. Legislation and federal guidance require agencies to develop and use architectures, and OMB has established the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (FEAPMO) to develop a federal enterprise architecture.

3. Our analysis of the 27 major departments and agencies showed that while most have fully satisfied a large percentage of the core elements across most of the stages, particularly those elements related to architecture governance, most departments and agencies are not yet where they need to be relative to architecture content, use, and measurement. The federal government is not as well positioned as it should be to realize the significant benefits that a well-managed architecture program can provide.

4. We recommend that the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Small Business Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development; the Attorney General; the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Social Security Administration; the Directors of the National Science Foundation and the Office of Personnel Management; and the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs ensure that their respective enterprise architecture programs develop and implement plans for fully satisfying each of the conditions in our enterprise architecture management maturity framework.

The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was concluded on October 13, 2005, and signed on January 19, 2006, by U.S. Trade Representative Bob Portman and Omani Minister of Commerce and Industry Maqbool bin Ali Sultan. The agreement aims to promote economic growth and trade between the two countries.

2. Oman is a small exporter of oil and natural gas, strategically located at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, and has a 170-year history of political and economic cooperation with the United States. The country is seeking to liberalize and diversify its trade regime to broaden economic opportunities for its fast-growing workforce.

3. The U.S.-Oman FTA has three basic parts: new tariff schedules, broad commitments to open markets, and protections for labor and the environment. The agreement provides for immediate duty-free access for tariff lines covering almost all consumer and industrial goods, with special provisions for agriculture and textiles and apparel.

4. The agreement also includes broad commitments to open markets in sectors such as banking, insurance, securities, and telecommunications, as well as protections for U.S. investors and holders of copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. However, labor groups have criticized the agreement for its weaknesses in labor provisions, arguing that it does not adequately protect workers in Oman.

5. The U.S.-Oman FTA was approved by Congress on September 26, 2006, and became Public Law 109-283. However, concerns were raised about the potential security risks posed by the agreement's provision on landside port operations, which some argued could obligate the United States to open up its port activities to foreign companies.

1. Concerns about hate crimes have become increasingly prominent among policymakers at all levels of government in recent years, with hate crimes defined as criminal offenses motivated by bias against a person's characteristics.

2. Congress has enacted several laws to address hate crimes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, and the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1994.

3. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the scope of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.

4. The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing Congress's authority to proscribe hate crimes.

5. The United States Supreme Court decision in United States v. Morrison narrowed the ""affects interstate commerce"" category, making it difficult for Congress to regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on its aggregate effect on interstate commerce.

6. The Court's decision in Morrison suggests that any attempts to broaden the scope of hate crime legislation tied to findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes under the commerce clause are constitutionally suspect.

7. However, hate crimes that involve interstate travel may still be within the commerce clause's reach, and other legislative powers such as the legislative clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments may be used to expand hate crime legislation.

8. Section 2 of the 13th Amendment may be a more viable option for broadening hate crime legislation, as it proscribes slavery and involuntary servitude without reference to federal, state, or private action.

9. The Court has observed that Congress has the power under the 13th Amendment to rationally determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery, and to translate that determination into effective legislation.

10. The Court has also considered constitutional challenges regarding state hate crime statutes under both the 1st and 6th Amendments, with the 1st Amendment declaring that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, and the 6th Amendment providing defendants a right to a jury trial.

1. The role and effectiveness of U.S. ambassadors and Chiefs of Mission (COM) have been a subject of congressional attention, particularly after the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.

2. The State Department and USAID's 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) emphasized the need to equip ambassadors to better perform their role, highlighting the importance of coordination among U.S. agencies.

3. COMs are the principal officers in charge of each U.S. diplomatic mission to a foreign country, foreign territory, or international organization, and are usually U.S. ambassadors who lead U.S. embassies abroad.

4. The U.S. Constitution authorizes the President to appoint ambassadors with the advice and consent of the Senate, and in circumstances where no presidentially appointed ambassador is serving, the President can appoint a career U.S. foreign service officer as a chargé d'affaires.

5. COMs serve as the President's personal representative, leading diplomatic efforts for a particular mission or in the country of assignment under the general supervision of the Secretary of State.

6. The role of the COM has expanded considerably since World War II, with COMs now responsible for overseeing nearly all U.S. government activities in their country of assignment, except for military operations.

7. COMs exercise their authority through their leadership of the embassy's ""country team,"" which includes the chief representative of each U.S. government agency undertaking activities in a host country.

8. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (FSA 1980) sets out the three main components of COM authority: responsibilities, authority over personnel, and obligations of U.S. government personnel and agencies to the COM.

9. COM authority extends to all executive branch personnel in a foreign country, except for those under the command of a U.S. Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC) or Voice of America (VOA) correspondents on official assignment.

10. The effectiveness of COM authority in practice has been questioned, with some analysts suggesting that COMs may not have the support of officials in Washington to overcome the pull of agency interests and pressures on a country team, and that further steps are needed to improve the exercise of COM authority, such as providing COMs with better training and support.

China's GDP growth slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009, and the country's trade and FDI plummeted sharply, with exports and imports down 22.0% and 23.6%, respectively, from January-July 2009 on a year-on-year basis.

2. In response to the global financial crisis, China has implemented a number of policies to stimulate and rebalance its economy, including a two-year, 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package, tax cuts and incentives, industry subsidies, and funding to help firms invest overseas. The Chinese government has also taken steps to boost rural incomes and spending levels, and to narrow the gap in living standards between rural and urban citizens. However, analysts have raised concerns that the stimulus policies could slow efforts to further reform the economy, and that China's long-term economic growth prospects will likely depend on the ability of the government to rebalance the economy by promoting greater domestic consumption and to deepen market-oriented economic reforms.

The policy aims to ensure the orderly and economic development of domestic mineral resources, reserves, and reclamation of metals and minerals to meet industrial, security, and environmental needs.

2. The leasing and permitting process for oil and gas development on federal public domain lands involves several steps, including the preparation of Resource Management Plans (RMPs) by the BLM, which serve as the initial determinant of which lands may be subject to leasing. The RMPs must allow oil and gas development in an area for it to take place. The Secretary of the Interior must also apply ""multiple use"" and ""sustained yield"" principles when developing RMPs. Additionally, the Secretary is required to provide opportunities for public participation in the development of RMPs, which can include procedures such as holding public hearings. The leasing process involves competitive and non-competitive leasing procedures, with competitive leasing involving a bidding process and non-competitive leasing involving a first-come, first-served approach.

1. Policymakers are considering reforming or limiting itemized tax deductions for individuals to increase federal tax revenue, simplify the tax code, and reduce incentives for inefficient economic behavior. However, some argue that limits on deductions could have adverse economic effects or change the distributional burden of the federal income tax code.

2. Itemized deductions are claimed by 30% of tax filers, with higher-income individuals more likely to itemize their deductions. In 2014, 91-93% of tax filers with an AGI greater than $200,000 chose to itemize, with an average sum of itemized deductions claimed ranging from $43,131 to $424,864.

3. The majority of itemizers (56.2%) had incomes less than $100,000, and 86.8% of itemizers had an AGI less than $200,000. Higher-income tax filers claimed a larger average total of itemized deductions, but the distribution of total itemized deduction claims was more even across income ranges.

4. The top four itemized deductions that are expected to contribute most to annual tax expenditures in FY2018 are the deduction for state and local income or sales taxes, the deduction for home mortgage interest, charitable gifts, and real estate taxes. These deductions are estimated to account for 17.8% of the approximately $1.36 trillion in net individual tax expenditures.

5. Some proposals to reform or limit itemized deductions include a flat, dollar-value cap or percentage-of-income cap on total deductions, a limit on the tax rate at which deductions can be valued, and converting deductions into credits. However, these policies may have limited ability to raise revenue and could affect tax filer behavior.

6. The structure of a limit on itemized deductions can affect which deductions a tax filer might claim, and the extent to which a limit increases revenue depends on its structure. Limits on itemized deductions may shift some tax filers to claim the standard deduction instead of itemizing, partially offsetting the revenue increase.

The region is strategically important, encompassing U.S. Pacific territories and attracting diplomatic attention and economic engagement from China.

2. The United States has economic interests in the region, particularly fishing, and provides foreign assistance to Pacific Island countries, which are among those most affected by climate change. The region includes 14 sovereign states with approximately 9 million people, including three countries in ""free association"" with the United States.

3. The region's gross domestic product (GDP) totals around $32 billion, with per capita incomes ranging from lower middle income to upper middle income. Despite weak political institutions and occasional civil unrest, human rights are generally respected, and governmental elections are considered free and fair.

4. The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) seeks to foster cooperation between member states, addressing key issues such as climate change, regional security, and fisheries. The PIF has 18 member states and territories, with the United States, Australia, and New Zealand playing key roles in regional security and economic development.

5. China has become a major source of foreign assistance in the region, providing $150 million in foreign assistance per year on average during the past decade. However, China's aid is largely in the form of concessional loans and infrastructure projects, which has raised concerns about transparency and corruption.

6. The United States has relied on Australia and New Zealand to help advance shared strategic interests, maintain regional stability, and promote economic development in the Southwest Pacific. The region faces significant environmental challenges, including climate change, ocean acidification, and overfishing, which have severe impacts on the economy and livelihoods of Pacific Islanders.

7. Pacific Island countries have sought international support for helping them to cope with the impacts of climate change, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increase renewable energy use and energy efficiency. The Paris Agreement, signed by 12 Pacific Island countries, aims to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, an existential matter for many Pacific Island states.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of species that are endangered or threatened with extinction, and listing a species results in limitations on activities that could affect that species and in penalties for the taking of individuals of a listed species.

2. Federal agencies are required to consult with either the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine whether an agency project might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify a species' critical habitat, a process known as consultation.

3. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with any reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to the agency action that would avoid jeopardy, and to excuse any incidental taking of listed species, the Services issue an incidental take statement that includes reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs) to minimize the effects of the project.

4. The exemption process is available for federal projects, licenses, or actions that cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, and it offers the opportunity to consider extraordinary economic circumstances in the list of factors used in evaluating federal actions.

5. The exemption process is a complex affair that involves the Endangered Species Committee (ESC), which reviews applications for exemptions and is responsible for the ultimate decision, and the process can take up to 280 days.

6. The ESC can grant an exemption if, based on the evidence, it determines that there are no reasonable and prudent alternatives to the agency action, the benefits of such action clearly outweigh the benefits of alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or its critical habitat, and the action is in the public interest.

7. Exemptions from the ESC are permanent unless the Secretary later finds, based on the best scientific data available, that the exemption would result in the extinction of a species that was not the subject of consultation nor identified in a biological assessment, and the ESC then determines within 60 days of the Secretary's finding that the exemption should not be permanent.

1. The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has been a topic of debate in Congress since the enactment of the individual income tax in 1913, with numerous bills introduced to change the way capital gains income is taxed. The current tax system allows for the deduction of capital losses against ordinary income, but with a $3,000 annual limit, which prevents taxpayers from selectively realizing losses to minimize their tax liabilities.

2. The current tax system also creates an asymmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, with long-term gains taxed at a maximum rate of 15% and long-term losses deductible without limit against short-term capital gains and ordinary income. This asymmetry allows taxpayers to time their gains and losses to minimize their tax liabilities, and increasing the net capital loss deduction would increase the rewards of gaming the system.

3. The empirical evidence suggests that capital gains income is heavily concentrated in the upper income ranges, and that raising the net capital loss limit would benefit a relatively small number of higher income individuals. The primary objective of recent economic proposals is to stimulate the economy, and tax benefits that favor individuals with high permanent incomes are relatively ineffective ways to stimulate the economy.

4. Achieving full symmetry in the tax system requires addressing the asymmetry between the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, which can be achieved by requiring a two-to-one ratio of net long-term losses to offset short-term gains and ordinary income, or by instituting a tax credit of 15% (or the maximum capital gain tax rate) for capital losses, capped and indexed to inflation.

The NLRB has defined the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" in section 2(11) of the NLRA, with ""assign"" referring to designating an employee to a place or giving significant duties, ""responsibly to direct"" involving oversight and accountability, and ""independent judgment"" requiring freedom from control and the ability to form opinions.

5. Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA prohibits employers from interfering with employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining, including the use or threatened use of violence, verbal threats, and interrogation about union sympathy and affiliation.

6. The NLRB has found unions to violate section 8(b)(1)(A) for engaging in misconduct such as encouraging employees to quit their jobs, threatening discharge for failure to sign union authorization cards, and attempting to cause an employer to discharge employees who opposed the union leadership.

7. Employers may make antiunion speeches to their employees on company time and property without allowing a union an equal opportunity to reply, but last-minute speeches made by employers within 24 hours before an election are prohibited.

8. The NLRB has established that an employer cannot be compelled to allow the distribution of union literature on its premises if a union can reach employees through other channels of communication, but must allow access if the employer's location and the employees' residences place them beyond the reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with them.

1. The banking system plays a central role in the financial system by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating capital across the economy, making it vital to the health and growth of the U.S. economy.

2. Banking is an inherently risky activity involving extending credit and taking on liabilities, which can generate tremendous societal and economic benefits but also create devastating losses.

3. A regulatory system has developed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks, and both banks and regulation have coevolved as market conditions have changed and different risks have emerged.

4. The 2008-2009 financial crisis led to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed to strengthen regulation and address risks, and the Basel III Accords, an international framework for bank regulation.

5. The regulatory system has been subject to debate, with some arguing that the potential benefits of the regulatory changes are outweighed by the potential costs, such as reduced credit availability and slower economic growth.

6. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established to regulate consumer financial products and services, but its structure and authorities have been contentious, with some arguing that it is too focused on consumer protection and restricts credit availability.

7. The CFPB's rulemaking and enforcement have been subject to debate, with some arguing that they have struck an appropriate balance between protecting consumers and ensuring credit availability, while others argue that they have been too burdensome and restrictive.

8. The ""too big to fail"" (TBTF) problem refers to large, complex, and interconnected financial institutions that may be incentivized to take on excessive risk due to the expectation of government support in the event of failure.

9. Enhanced prudential regulation has been implemented to reduce the likelihood of large bank failure, but its effectiveness and efficiency are subject to debate, with some arguing that it has been applied too broadly and includes institutions that are not large or complex enough to be considered TBTF.

10. The regulatory burden on community banks has been a concern, with some arguing that it is too onerous and drives consolidation, while others argue that it is necessary to ensure systemic stability and protect consumers.

2. The Act suspended the Medicare physician payment cut scheduled to take effect and provided SCHIP funding through March 2009, averting a 10.1% reduction in the fee schedule for physician reimbursement in 2008 and a 5% annual reduction thereafter.

3. The Act also extended a number of expiring provisions and programs, including Medicare plans and providers, Medicaid payments and programs, and miscellaneous activities such as funding for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs and Area Agencies on Aging.

4. The Act allowed Medicare Special Needs Plans to continue to restrict their enrollment to Medicaid-entitled institutionalized beneficiaries and other specified individuals until January 1, 2010, and extended cost-based plans under Medicare to operate in an area with two local or two regional Medicare Advantage plans until January 1, 2009.

5. The Act extended exceptions to annual per beneficiary payment limits on outpatient physical therapy services and speech language pathology services for the next six months and allowed qualified rural hospitals to continue to be reimbursed under a reasonable cost system rather than a fee schedule.

6. The Act extended the Medicare incentive payment program for certain physicians providing services in scarcity areas and Medicare payments for the accommodation of physicians ordered to active duty in the Armed Services, as well as cost reimbursement for brachytherapy services and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals.

7. The Act also extended increased payments for Medicaid disproportionate hospital share (DSH) allotments for Tennessee and Hawaii, continued Medicaid benefits through June 30, 2008, for certain low-income families, and extended Medicaid's coverage of Medicare part B premiums under the Qualifying Individual (QI) program.

8. The Act prohibited the Secretary from taking action to restrict Medicaid coverage of school-based, health-related services, including transportation and administrative activities, for the next six months and provided additional funds under the State Health Insurance Assistance Programs to assist Medicare-eligible individuals in obtaining information and counseling on enrollment in health insurance.

It was established in 1967 to foster regional dialogue during the turbulent post-colonial, Cold War period.

2. The Obama Administration is pursuing a policy of expanding and upgrading U.S. relations with Southeast Asia, and with ASEAN itself, in contrast to the Bush Administration's narrowly focused approach on terrorism.

3. The United States has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia, including maritime security, the promotion of democracy and human rights, liberal trade and investment regimes, counterterrorism, and combating illegal trafficking.

4. ASEAN has traditionally operated on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, which has led to considerable difficulty in the group operating in formal concert.

5. The United States has been steadily expanding and deepening its relations with ASEAN since the middle of the decade, with the Obama Administration taking steps to increase the multilateral dimension of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia.

6. ASEAN has been pursuing ways to expedite closer economic ties amongst its 10 member nations with the goal of creating an ASEAN Economic Community, and has also been actively promoting the creation of a larger, Asia-based free trade area.

7. ASEAN's efforts to create the ASEAN Economic Community have been complemented by its interest in negotiating trade agreements with key Asian nations, including the United States, China, India, Japan, and South Korea.

8. The Obama Administration's revision of U.S. policy toward Burma has coincided with a similar review by ASEAN of its stance on relations with the ruling junta, and there may be an opportunity for ASEAN and the United States to confer and coordinate their policies toward Burma.

2. Cuba has been on the list since 1982, and its retention on the list has received more attention in recent years due to increased support for legislative initiatives to lift some U.S. economic sanctions under the current embargo.

3. The list is maintained under the authority of Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, which requires validated licenses for exports to countries on the list, except for items specially allowed by public law, such as informational materials, humanitarian assistance, and food and medicine.

4. Being listed as a sponsor of international terrorism also restricts bilateral assistance in annual foreign assistance appropriations acts and makes a country ineligible for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) if it is on the Section 6(j) terrorism list.

5. Cuba's retention on the terrorism list has been criticized by some, who argue that it is a holdover of the Cold War and that domestic political considerations keep Cuba on the list, diverting U.S. attention from struggles against serious terrorist threats.

6. The level of terrorist activity by countries on the state sponsors of terrorism list varies considerably, and some suggest that there should be a tiered approach with sanctions calibrated to the degree of support for terrorism, while others believe that any level of support for terrorism is unacceptable and must be met with strong sanctions.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) provides an alternative tax calculation on a broader tax base than the regular tax, with individuals adding back certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions.

2. The AMT has exemptions of $45,000 for joint returns and $33,750 for single returns, with the first $175,000 taxed at 26% and the remainder taxed at 28%, and exemptions are phased out.

3. The AMT is not indexed to inflation, resulting in an increase in the number of taxpayers covered by the AMT, from 140,000 in 1987 to 823,000 in 1999, and projected to reach 9 million in 2009.

4. The AMT will become increasingly important in the years to come, with a projected 6.3% of all tax returns filed in 2009 paying the AMT, and the number of taxpayers affected by the credit limit expected to increase.

5. Tax provisions that reduce regular tax liabilities without altering the AMT will interact with the AMT, increasing the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit.

6. The marriage penalty legislation, which aimed to address the marriage penalty for most taxpayers, would have increased the number of taxpayers on the AMT or constrained by it via credits by 49% by 2010.

7. The Treasury Department estimates that about half the tax cuts in the marriage penalty legislation would have disappeared after ten years due to the AMT, with 28% of the marriage penalty tax cuts taken back by the AMT in the first year.

8. Indexing AMT exemptions would cost $13.9 billion by 2008, and eliminating the credit limit provision would cost about $1 billion currently, but would cost many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009.

9. Some propose eliminating the AMT, while others see it as a desirable alternative tax with a wider base, and suggest adjusting the AMT to conform to regular tax changes, such as increasing the exemption by the increase in the standard deduction.

The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate are responsible for drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies.

2. The THUD appropriations bill is divided into four titles: Title I funds DOT, Title II funds HUD, Title III funds a collection of agencies involved in transportation or housing and community development, and Title IV sets out general provisions applicable to the bill.

3. The majority of the Department of Transportation's budget is in the form of contract authority, which is a type of mandatory budget authority based on federal trust fund resources, while the majority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget is in the form of discretionary appropriations.

4. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request for THUD included a reduction of $9.7 billion from FY2017 levels, with the House-passed bill providing a reduction of less than 1% and the Senate-reported bill recommending a 2% increase.

5. The Senate-reported bill for FY2018 included several policy provisions different from those in the House bill, including authorizing an increase in the passenger facility charge that airports can charge passengers to help pay for airport improvements and appropriating considerably less funding for the Federal Railroad Administration State of Good Repair grant program.

1. In 2005, the U.S. and India agreed to establish a ""global partnership"" through increased cooperation on various issues, including energy and the environment, but India's friendship with Iran could become a significant obstacle to further development of U.S.-India ties.

2. India and Iran have traditionally had positive relations, with the two countries launching a ""strategic partnership"" in 2003, and Indian leaders often speak of ""civilizational ties"" between the two nations.

3. The U.S. has expressed concerns about India's defense relations with Iran and has sought to link this with congressional approval of U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation, with some in Congress worrying about India's plans to seek energy resources from Iran.

4. Indian firms have taken long-term contracts for the purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports the proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan, which the Bush Administration strongly opposes.

5. Some analysts believe that geostrategic motives beyond energy security, including great power aspirations, drive India's pursuit of closer relations with Iran, and the Indian government has made clear that it does not wish to see a new nuclear weapons power in the region.

6. India has voted with the majority in referring Iran to the U.N. Security Council, despite its traditionally close relations with Iran, and has also imposed restrictions on nuclear-related exports to Iran in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1737.

7. India and Iran have established steady but relatively low-level defense and military relations since the formation of an Indo-Iran Joint Commission in 1983, with some joint naval exercises and cooperation on defense projects.

Opponents of stricter import controls argue that they would increase costs for dairy farmers and result in higher retail food prices, while major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the US market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new US restrictions on MPC imports.

3. The proposed legislation to limit imports of MPCs, casein, and caseinates would introduce two separate tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) and assess duties on imports exceeding the quotas, potentially affecting over half of the annual trade in MPCs and casein/caseinates, and could lead to compensation negotiations with WTO member countries that are major suppliers of MPCs to the US market.

2. In Florida v. Jardines, the Court decided whether a trained narcotics-detection dog's sniff at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house is a Fourth Amendment search.

3. The Court held that a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government physically intrudes upon constitutionally protected areas, and that the use of a trained drug-detection dog at the front door and on the porch of a home is a search.

4. In Florida v. Harris, the Court decided whether an alert by a well-trained narcotics-detection dog certified to detect illegal contraband is sufficient to establish probable cause to search a vehicle.

5. The Florida Supreme Court held that the fact that a drug-detection dog has been trained and certified to detect narcotics, standing alone, is not sufficient to demonstrate the reliability of the dog and thereby establish probable cause to conduct a search.

6. The United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed the judgment in the Florida Supreme Court's decision, holding that the positive reaction of a reliable dog trained to detect the presence of narcotics is sufficient to establish probable cause.

7. In Bailey v. United States, the Court decided whether the detention of an individual who has just left premises to be searched under warrant is permissible when the individual is detained out of view of the house as soon as possible.

8. The Court held that the Summers rule, which allows for the detention of occupants of premises while a search is conducted, does not permit off-site detention incident to the execution of a search warrant.

9. In Missouri v. McNeely, the Court decided whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases.

10. The Court held that the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant, and that the warrant requirement yields to exceptions when it encounters emergency circumstances.

2. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows, but has also made the nation's energy infrastructure vulnerable to unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions, revealing a new cybersecurity challenge for electric power systems.

3. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is charged with a mission to support more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure, and to achieve this mission, OE supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development (R&D), demonstration projects, partnerships, facilitation, modeling and analytics, and emergency preparedness and response.

4. OE's goal for the future grid is to support economic growth and energy innovation through delivery of reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to consumers where, when, and how they want it, and to accomplish this mission, the Office works with a variety of stakeholders, including private industry and federal, state, local, and tribal governments on a variety of initiatives to modernize the electric grid.

5. The FY2017 request for OE sought $262 million, which would have been a $56 million, or 27%, increase over the FY2016 level, and the largest requested increases are for Energy Storage and three new programs—State Distribution-Level Reform, State Energy Assurance, and Grid Institute, while the largest requested cuts are sought for Cybersecurity and for Clean Energy Transmission and Reliability.

2. Prior to the CWA, Congress had authorized over 100 memorials in the District of Columbia, but there were no statutory criteria for authorizing commemorative works, and Congress had to establish how sponsoring organizations would choose site locations and approve memorial designs.

3. The CWA defines a commemorative work as ""any statue, monument, sculpture, memorial, plaque, inscription, or other structure of landscape feature"" designed to perpetuate the memory of an individual, group, event, or other significant element of American history.

4. The CWA divides the District of Columbia and its environs into three sections for the placement of memorials: the Reserve, Area I, and Area II, with specific standards for memorial placement in each area.

5. To establish a memorial in the District of Columbia, a sponsor must follow a 24-step process, which includes seeking assistance from the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, introducing authorizing legislation, site selection, design approval, fundraising, and construction.

The Supreme Court has consistently viewed the Take Care Clause as imposing a ""duty"" or ""obligation"" upon the President to ensure that executive branch officials obey Congress's commands, and that the Clause does not provide the President with the authority to frustrate legal requirements imposed by law.

5. The judicial branch has traditionally accorded federal prosecutors ""broad"" latitude in making a range of investigatory and prosecutorial determinations, including when, against whom, and whether to prosecute particular criminal violations of federal law.

6. Agency civil enforcement decisions in the administrative context ""share[] to some extent the characteristics of the decision of a prosecutor"" in the criminal context, and courts generally will not review discretionary agency enforcement decisions, except in situations where Congress has removed or restricted the agency's discretion.

7. Congress may alter the default rule of executive enforcement discretion by explicitly guiding or restricting the exercise of that discretion through statute, and the Supreme Court has stated that ""[a]ll constitutional questions aside, it is for Congress to determine how the rights which it creates shall be enforced.""

1. In 2013, the official U.S. poverty rate was 14.5%, a statistically significant drop from 15.0% in 2012, with 45.3 million persons estimated as having income below the official poverty line. The poverty rate is closely tied to the economic cycle, with poverty rates increasing during economic recessions and decreasing during periods of sustained economic growth.

2. The poverty rate varies significantly across different demographic groups, with minorities, women and children, the very old, the unemployed, and those with low levels of educational attainment or disability being especially prone to poverty. In 2013, 27.2% of blacks and 23.5% of Hispanics had incomes below poverty, compared to 9.6% of non-Hispanic whites.

3. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is an alternative poverty measure that addresses some of the weaknesses of the official poverty measure, including the failure to account for government programs and policies that affect disposable income. The SPM includes a more comprehensive income/resource definition, expands the definition of the economic unit, and adjusts for necessary expenses such as taxes, work-related expenses, and medical out-of-pocket expenses.

1. The U.S. agricultural sector plays a significant role in global trade, with exports accounting for about 20% of total U.S. agricultural production. The farm bill, which is renewed every five or six years, is subject to intense scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules and its potential impact on future multilateral negotiations.

2. The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs according to their potential to distort commercial markets. The AoA sets country-specific aggregate spending limits on the most market-distorting policies, known as amber box subsidies, and provides exemptions for green box and blue box programs.

3. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays, and domestic farm programs are also subject to rules under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). The SCM details rules for determining when a subsidy is ""prohibited"" or ""actionable"" and provides a framework for evaluating the market distortion of a program or policy.

4. The U.S. farm bill includes provisions to ensure WTO compliance, such as the safety trigger provision in Section 1601(d) of the 2014 farm bill, which allows USDA to adjust program outlays to avoid breaching the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) limit. The last U.S. notification to the WTO was made on December 8, 2014, for the 2012 marketing year and the farm programs of the 2008 farm bill.

1. The campus-based programs, which include the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program, the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program, are considered campus-based because federal funds are awarded directly to institutions of higher education (IHEs) that administer the programs and provide institutional funds to match the federal funds they receive.

2. The campus-based programs are unique in that the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined according to institution-specific award criteria, rather than according to non-discretionary award criteria such as those applicable to Pell Grants and Direct Loans.

3. The authorizations of appropriations for the campus-based programs expired at the end of FY2015, but the FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, while the Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017.

4. The campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort, with 76% of federal aid in FY2016 going through the Direct Loan program, 21% through the Pell Grant program, and 2% through the campus-based aid programs.

5. The formula for allocating funds to institutions that participate in the campus-based programs is a two-stage process, with a base guarantee and a fair share allocation, and has been criticized for not taking into account current student demographics and need, and for favoring long-term IHE participants over new participants.

6. Several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered during reauthorization, including whether the programs serve a distinctive purpose, whether the formula for allocating funds is optimal, and whether the programs should be consolidated or eliminated, and proposals have been made to change the formula for allocating campus-based funds to institutions, target funds to institutions based on outcome metrics of students, and limit student eligibility to participate in the FWS programs to undergraduate students.

1. Adults may go missing for various reasons, including personal choice, disabling conditions, natural catastrophes, or crimes such as abduction. Unlike children, adults have the legal right to go missing under most circumstances, which limits the assistance families receive from state and local law enforcement agencies.

2. Media attention to cases of missing adults, particularly seniors with dementia, has prompted policymakers to consider expanding the federal government's role in helping to recover vulnerable adults who go missing.

3. Congress has proposed measures to assist in recovery efforts, including a grant program to encourage states to establish, expand, and coordinate alert systems for vulnerable adults.

4. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) gathered data on existing state alert systems in 11 states, which were established beginning in 2006 and are administered by local and/or state law enforcement agencies.

5. The alert systems are intended to alert law enforcement entities and/or the public that vulnerable adults are missing and may need assistance, with many states activating alerts on behalf of targeted groups of individuals who may be at high risk of going missing.

6. The 11 states identified with active alert systems are Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia, with most states passing a law to create the alert system for missing adults.

7. The administration of state alert systems for missing vulnerable adults appears to be a cooperative effort among state and local law enforcement agencies, with some states having a lead state agency responsible for activating alerts and others having localized models for dissemination.

8. States have defined their target populations differently, with some targeting older adults, while others can be activated on behalf of adults of any age, and all states activating alerts on behalf of adults who are disabled due to a mental or cognitive impairment.

9. States have established specific criteria for activating a missing adult alert, including the person's status being unknown, the person's disappearance posing a credible threat to their health or safety, and sufficient information to provide information to law enforcement agencies and/or the public about the missing individual.

10. The federal government could play a role in further developing state alert systems by providing funding, developing minimum guidelines, and providing technical support and training, as well as assisting states with developing their systems so that data are more uniformly collected about the use and efficacy of state alert systems.

2. The federal estate tax is a tax on the estate of a decedent, levied against and paid by the estate, while the inheritance tax is imposed on and paid by the heirs of the decedent based upon the money or property that they receive.

3. The gross estate of a decedent includes the value of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, in which the decedent owned an interest on the date of the decedent's death, and may also include certain interests in property which the decedent had transferred to another person at some time prior to the date of death.

4. The taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate with allowable deductions, including estate administration expenses, certain debts and losses, the amount of qualified transfers to a surviving spouse, charitable bequests, and state death taxes, and the estate tax liability is computed by applying the tax rate schedule to the combined value of the taxable estate and lifetime taxable gifts.

5. The federal gift tax is a tax imposed on an annual basis on all gratuitous transfers of property made during life, and the tax liability is determined by the value of the taxable gift, which is the fair market value of the gift at the time it was made, less certain exclusions and deductions.

3. The development of congressional concern and policy approaches began with inquiries related to the nature of the terrorist threat, followed by specific, targeted measures to protect the nation after the 9/11 attacks, and recent efforts to respond to the report of the 9/11 Commission.

4. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated many federal agencies responsible for border and transportation security into a single department, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which houses the Directorate of BTS, responsible for securing the borders, territorial waters, and transportation systems of the United States.

5. The DHS has implemented various programs and policies to enhance border security, including the Container Security Initiative (CSI), the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers' Rapid Inspection (SENTRI) program.

6. The use of technology is a key aspect of border security, with initiatives such as the U.S.-VISIT program, which tracks the entry and exit of foreign nationals, and the use of biometric identifiers, such as facial recognition and fingerprints, to positively identify people seeking entry into the United States.

1. The U.S. Constitution establishes two methods by which Presidents may appoint officers of the United States: either with the advice and consent of the Senate, or unilaterally ""during the Recess of the Senate."" The Recess Appointments Clause has been a source of tension between Presidents and Congresses, and this tension was illuminated by President Obama's difficulty in obtaining Senate confirmation of nominations for the Directorship of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) and Members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

2. President Obama formally nominated Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the CFPB on July 18, 2011, but the Senate fell seven votes shy of the 60-vote threshold necessary to reach cloture and move to a vote on the nomination. The NLRB, an agency with certain powers to investigate and adjudicate unfair labor practices, consists of up to five officials who are to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

3. In 2010, the NLRB had operated with a quorum of three or more members, but by August 2011, there were only three members remaining, the minimum number of members required to establish a quorum. President Obama nominated Terrence F. Flynn, Sharon Block, and Richard F. Griffin Jr. to be Board members, but the Senate did not confirm any of the nominees before the third member's term expired.

4. The President considered making recess appointments should the Senate go into recess, but the Senate held ""pro forma"" sessions, which are intended to prevent the existence of a Senate recess sufficient to permit the President to exercise his constitutional authority to unilaterally appoint officers. On January 4, 2012, the President, asserting his Recess Appointments Clause powers, announced his intent to appoint Cordray to serve as the first CFPB Director and Block, Griffin Jr., and Flynn, to be members of the NLRB.

5. A reviewing court may consider whether the President's recess appointments were lawful, and the primary issue before the court would be whether the appointments were made in compliance with the strictures of the Recess Appointments Clause. The court may also consider whether a ""Recess"" for purposes of the Clause must be a minimum number of days for the President to exercise his authority.

Sanders (1964) establishing the principle of ""one person, one vote"" and the requirement for congressional districts to be drawn with approximately equal population. The Court has also clarified the extent to which precise mathematical equality among districts is required, with cases such as Kirkpatrick v. Preisler (1986) and Karcher v. Dagett (1982) establishing that absolute population equality is the standard for congressional districts unless a deviation is necessary to achieve a legitimate state objective.

2. The Court has also addressed the question of who should be counted for the purposes of achieving equality among districts, with the recent case of Evenwel v. Abbott (2016) holding that states are not required to draw district lines based on the number of eligible or registered voters, but can instead use total population. Additionally, the Court has considered the creation of majority-minority districts, with cases such as Thornburg v. Gingles (1986) establishing a three-prong test for determining whether a district is a majority-minority district.

3. The Court has also addressed the issue of partisan gerrymandering, with cases such as Cox v. Larios (2002) and Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (2015) considering the extent to which partisanship can justify differences in population between districts. The Court has also upheld the constitutionality of independent commissions for drawing congressional district boundaries, with the case of Arizona State Legislature v.

Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory for most state and local government employees not covered by public pension plans starting in July 1991.

2. Mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees has been recommended by recent deficit reduction groups, such as the Bipartisan Policy Center and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, to increase the universality of the program and mitigate risks for plan sponsors and participants.

3. Long-range projections show that Social Security expenditures will exceed income by 16% on average over the next 75 years, and mandatory coverage of newly hired state and local government employees is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds, closing 8-9% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall.

4. Mandatory Social Security coverage could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions, and provide better benefit protections for workers and their families through the provision of dependents' and survivors' benefits under Social Security.

5. However, opponents argue that mandatory Social Security coverage would not necessarily result in better benefit protections for workers, as state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits currently available under non-covered pension plans to keep overall pension costs down, and that the added Social Security coverage could impose significant administrative burdens on state and local governments.

6. Some argue that non-covered state and local government workers should share in providing the poverty reduction that occurs through the Social Security system, which offers disability benefits, dependents' benefits, and survivors' benefits, in addition to retirement benefits, and that mandatory Social Security coverage would be fairer and more equitable for all workers.

1. The United States has approximately 766 million acres of forestlands, with 58% (445 million acres) being privately owned by individuals, families, Native American tribes, corporations, and other groups.

2. The federal government has various programs to support forest management on private and public forests, primarily administered by the Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

3. These programs aim to achieve forest management and protection goals, including wildfire planning and response, and supporting the development of new wood products markets.

4. The State and Private Forestry (SPF) branch of the FS administers most forestry assistance programs, often in partnership with state agencies.

5. The USDA has been providing forestry assistance for over a century, with initial efforts beginning in 1881 and the creation of the USDA Division of Forestry.

6. The Forest Service has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance.

7. The 2008 farm bill established national funding priorities for forestry assistance programs, including conserving working forests, protecting and restoring forests, and enhancing public benefits from private forests.

8. To be eligible for most forestry assistance programs, states must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, which includes a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term forest resource strategy.

9. The forestry programs may provide technical assistance, financial assistance, or both, with funding typically delivered through formula or competitive grants, cost-sharing, or other means.

10. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with the average annual appropriation from FY2004 to FY2018 being $362.7 million, and the Administration requesting $197.4 million in FY2019.

1. Transnational organized crime groups in Burma are involved in various illicit activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, wildlife trafficking, and arms smuggling, generating billions of dollars in profits each year. The country's extra-legal economy is so large that an accurate assessment of its size and structure is unavailable.

2. Corruption among officials in Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), facilitates trafficking and provides immunity from law enforcement and judicial action, making it a low-risk enterprise. The continued presence of transnational crime in Burma shares features with ""ungoverned spaces"" where governments have difficulty establishing control or are complicit in the corruption of the rule of law.

3. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on Burma due to its involvement in transnational crime, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, which prohibits the indirect import of Burmese gems and imposes further sanctions on SPDC officials. The State Department has also designated Burma as a major drug-producing state and a Tier 3 state engaged in the most severe forms of trafficking in persons.

4. Despite U.S. sanctions, the effectiveness of these measures is limited by factors such as unevenly applied sanctions by other countries, a booming natural gas production and export industry, and China's continued economic and military assistance to Burma. The U.S. is assisting neighboring countries with stemming the flow of trafficked contraband from Burma, but most U.S. assistance to combat transnational crime in Burma remains in suspension.

1. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has had a significant impact on federal mandatory spending, with most of the projected spending going towards expanding health insurance coverage, including premium tax credits, cost-sharing reduction payments, and federal matching funds for Medicaid expansion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that gross spending on insurance coverage expansion under the ACA will total $1.938 trillion over the 10-year period FY2017 through FY2026.

2. The ACA provided more than $100 billion in mandatory appropriations and Medicare fund transfers over the 10-year period FY2010-FY2019, with most of the appropriations being temporary, but some being permanent, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), and the environmental health screening. The ACA appropriations are sequestrable at the percentage rate applicable to nonexempt nondefense mandatory spending, with some exceptions, such as cuts in Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) funding for community health centers and migrant health centers, which are capped at 2%.

1. The increased presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs has been a concern for some in the scientific community, as enrollment of U.S. citizens in these programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students.

2. Approximately 56% of foreign doctorate degree earners on temporary visas remain in the United States, with many eventually becoming citizens, and foreign students are often seen as a stepping stone to immigration through sponsorships for legal permanent residence.

3. The scientific community has been divided over proposals to impose stricter immigration limits on people with scientific and technical skills, with some arguing that foreign students generate benefits such as increased skilled workers, tuition revenue, and research assistance.

4. However, others argue that foreign students displace U.S. workers, lower wages, and decline working conditions, and that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers has resulted in depressed job opportunities and a weakened U.S. workforce.

5. The debate on the presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and the workforce intensified following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and concerns have been expressed about the access of foreign scientists and engineers to research and development related to chemical and biological weapons.

6. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation has been reintroduced in the 111th Congress, which would exempt specified categories of U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and address issues related to the H-1B visa program.

2. Cryptocurrencies have gained widespread attention and interest in recent years, with some government central banks examining the possibility of issuing their own digital currencies. However, the use of cryptocurrencies is still limited compared to traditional payment systems.

3. The functions of money include serving as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies have struggled to fulfill these functions, particularly in terms of serving as a unit of account and a store of value due to their high volatility.

4. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it difficult to identify authoritative sources of industry data, and the recent proliferation of cryptocurrencies adds additional challenges to performing industry-wide analysis.

5. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide several benefits, including reducing costs associated with traditional payment systems, increasing privacy and control over personal data, and providing a desirable alternative for individuals who do not trust traditional financial institutions.

6. However, cryptocurrencies also face several challenges to widespread adoption, including their limited scalability, high energy consumption, and the need for trusted intermediaries to facilitate transactions.

7. Policymakers are faced with various issues related to cryptocurrency, including concerns about its alleged facilitation of crime, the adequacy of consumer protections, the level of appropriate regulation, and its potential effect on monetary policy.

1. The proposed legislation, H.R. 3652, aims to modify Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide greater protection for labor groups in the event of a debtor company's request to reject a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The bill proposes to limit the modifications to the existing CBA that can be proposed by the debtor, restrict the court's discretion in approving rejection, and provide labor groups with a greater role in determining the feasibility of reorganization.

2. The bill would also extend the right to strike to all labor groups whenever a CBA is modified or rejected without their consent, provide labor groups with a defined remedy for rejection of a CBA, and allow labor groups to request arbitration rather than a court hearing to determine approval of a debtor's request to reject a CBA. Additionally, the bill would require the debtor and authorized representative to meet to determine the effects on the labor group when a debtor's reorganization plan involves selling all or part of the business or ceasing some or all of the business.

This title includes the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, the DHS headquarters consolidation project, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Analysis and Operations, and the Office of Inspector General for the department.

2. The Administration requested $1,396 million in total budgetary resources for these accounts in FY2016, an increase of $255 million (22.3%) above the FY2015 enacted level. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $1,346 million, a decrease of $73 million (5.2%) from the request and $182 million (16.0%) above FY2015.

3. The law provided total funding of $701 million for Departmental Management in Title I, and $203 million in three general provisions, not including the funding for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths. This was a decrease of $2 million or 0.3% from the President's request of $702 million under Title I, but an increase of $160 million in funding provided through general provisions.

4. The Administration requested $134 million for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) and 597 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs). Title I of Division F of P.L. 114-113 provided $137 million for OSEM, $3.2 million (2.4%) more than requested.

1. The distinction between net job loss and gross job loss is crucial in understanding the labor market dynamics. Net job loss refers to the overall decline in employment, while gross job loss refers to the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in a given period.

2. Gross job loss is a normal part of a functioning market economy, and it is often offset by gross job gains, resulting in net job creation. However, during recessions, the overall labor market experiences persistent net job loss.

3. Trade liberalization has been identified as a potential cause of job loss, but the evidence suggests that it has no negative effect on employment or that its effect is swamped by other factors. In fact, trade liberalization has been associated with rising employment and falling unemployment in the post-war period.

4. Offshore outsourcing and direct investment abroad have also been cited as causes of job loss, but the evidence suggests that they do not lead to net job loss. Instead, they can lead to gross job gains in other sectors of the economy.

5. Economic restructuring, including the decline of certain industries, is a normal part of a market economy and does not typically lead to net job loss. However, it can lead to significant job loss at the local level.

6. Policymakers can use expansionary monetary and fiscal policy to mitigate net job loss, but direct job creation programs and policies that impede gross job loss can have high efficiency costs. Instead, policymakers can focus on addressing market failures, such as adverse selection and moral hazard, by providing unemployment insurance and other forms of income support.

He won the LDP leadership contest in September 2018, securing a three-year term as party president.

2. Abe's victory in the LDP leadership contest means that he will continue serving as premier, and if he remains in power beyond November 2019, he will become the longest-serving prime minister in the history of modern Japan.

3. The U.S.-Japan relationship has been strengthened by a shared approach to confronting the North Korean threat, but tensions have risen due to Trump's shift on North Korea and his statements critical of the value of alliances generally and Japan specifically.

4. Japan and China appear to be seeking stability in their bilateral relationship, with Abe scheduled to visit Beijing in late October for a leaders' summit to deepen economic cooperation and increase people-to-people exchanges.

5. Japan's relations with South Korea remain precarious due to historical grievances, particularly over the issue of Korean comfort women who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers in the World War II era.

The MCA was designed to provide funding to low and lower-middle income countries that have demonstrated a commitment to sound development policies.

2. The MCA was created to address the issue of poverty and its relationship to terrorism, as well as to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The initiative was based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to sound economic and good governance policies.

3. The MCA was designed to be a performance-based program, where countries would be selected based on their past and current performance, and programs would be evaluated on and required to show measurable achievements that impact favorably on economic growth and poverty reduction.

4. The MCA authorizing legislation was passed in 2003, which established the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) as the entity responsible for managing the MCA. The MCC would be headed by a CEO who would report to the Board of Directors, which would include the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other officials.

5. The MCA would provide funding to a wide range of entities, including central governments, NGOs, regional and local governments, and private groups. The legislation required that the United States enter into a ""Compact"" with a qualifying country that describes the program to be funded, how it will be monitored, and how the development goals will be achieved.

6. The MCA was designed to be a flexible program, with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities. However, the program also faced challenges, including the need to balance competing demands for funding and the need to ensure that the program was effective and efficient in achieving its goals.

2. The Senate-passed farm bill (S. 3240) and the House Agriculture Committee-reported bill (H.R. 6083) both reduce spending by $23.1 billion and $35.1 billion, respectively, compared to the baseline of the 2008 farm bill, which would cost nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years.

3. Both bills restructure farm commodity support by eliminating direct payments, the existing counter-cyclical price program, and the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program, and provide programs for covered crops, except cotton, which would have its own program.

4. The Senate bill provides for only a revised revenue program called Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC), while the House bill retains producer choice between a counter-cyclical price program (renamed Price Loss Coverage or PLC) and a revenue program (renamed Revenue Loss Coverage or RLC).

5. Both bills reauthorize four disaster programs covering livestock and tree assistance for FY2012-FY2017, but do not reauthorize the crop disaster program from the 2008 farm bill (i.e., Supplemental Revenue Assistance, or SURE).

6. The Senate bill reduces the farm program payment limit to $50,000 per person for ARC and adds a $75,000 limit on loan deficiency payments (LDPs), while the House bill sets the program payment limit under the PLC and RLC at $125,000 and has no limit on LDPs.

The law reauthorized selected provisions of the 2007 America COMPETES Act and authorized approximately $45.5 billion in funding between FY2010 and FY2013.

2. The President's FY2013 budget request for COMPETES 2010 provisions included increased funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science. The request also included support for STEM education activities, but did not seek funding for some COMPETES 2010 authorized programs.

The request also included funding for a new Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering and Materials (SusCHEM) program.

4. The DOE Office of Science's FY2013 budget request was $4.992 billion, which was $57.0 million (1.2%) more than the FY2012 current plan funding level. The request also included $350.0 million for the ARPA-E account, which was $75.0 million (27.3%) more than the FY2012 current plan level.

5. The FY2013 appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies were provided in two sequential acts: P.L. 112-175 and P.L. 113-6. The final FY2013 appropriations act, P.L. 113-6, included rescissions that applied to COMPETES 2010 accounts.

6. The FY2013 funding levels for COMPETES 2010 accounts were generally below FY2010 levels, and the combined effects of sequestration, rescissions, and funding levels in the final FY2013 appropriations act decreased funding levels for many accounts below FY2010 actual levels.

The 2008 amendments expanded the definition of a plant to include nonindigenous plants and required importers to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the time of importation.

2. The declaration requirements under the Lacey Act are controversial, with some importers finding it difficult to comply due to the complexity of the requirements and the lack of clarity on how to exercise due care. The declaration requirements were implemented in 2009 and 2010, but APHIS has acknowledged that the process may not be feasible for all importers.

3. The Lacey Act Compliance Program, established in the Gibson Guitar case, provides a guideline for exercising due care, but it is binding only to Gibson Guitar and is not intended to be a pronouncement of what the Department of Justice intends due care to mean. Establishing a process for exercising due care under the Lacey Act has been proposed to clarify guidelines and provide a benchmark for law enforcement officials.

4. Potential changes to the Lacey Act have been suggested, including removing violations of foreign laws from the act, limiting the applicability of foreign laws to those that directly address conservation, and modifying the declaration requirements through regulations or law. Some contend that changes should be done through law, while others argue that changes should be done through regulations, and some suggest that efforts to change the implementation of the Lacey Act through regulations have stalled and not produced results.

A civilian nuclear cooperation agreement was initialed by the two countries in December 2013 and signed in May 2014 under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.

2. The U.S.-Vietnam 123 agreement was subject to congressional review, and at least four issues were prominent during the review period: nonproliferation commitments, Vietnam's human rights record, the strategic relationship between the two countries, and the benefits for U.S. companies.

3. Vietnam has nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia, France, China, South Korea, Japan, and Canada, and the U.S. nuclear industry contends that billions of dollars of exports could result from the Vietnam 123 agreement.

4. The agreement would facilitate the transfer of nuclear energy technology and could help Vietnam meet its goal of generating 20%-30% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2050, with plans to build its first nuclear power plants in the coming decades.

5. The agreement also includes provisions for Vietnam to rely on international markets for its nuclear fuel supply, rather than acquiring sensitive nuclear technologies, and the United States promises to support international markets to ensure a reliable nuclear fuel supply for Vietnam.

2. The chronology includes significant meetings, events, and statements that shed light on the issues surrounding North Korea's nuclear weapons program, with a focus on the Six-Party Talks, inter-Korean relations, and U.S. policy.

3. In 2005, there was little progress in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue, despite adjustments to U.S. policy, including changes to senior officials and the addition of human rights and criminal activities to the agenda.

4. North Korea escalated the security situation on the Korean peninsula through words and actions, including announcing nuclear weapons and suspending participation in the Six-Party Talks.

5. In July 2005, negotiators from the six nations re-convened in Beijing for a fourth round of talks, resulting in a joint statement of principles that committed North Korea to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.

6. However, the agreement was short-lived, as North Korea demanded light-water reactors (LWRs) from the United States in exchange for returning to the IAEA's Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).

7. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on Banco Delta Asia, a Macau bank allegedly involved in laundering U.S. dollars counterfeited by North Korea, which led to a chilling effect on the Six-Party Talks.

1. The study compared two methods for increasing proteome coverage: repetitive LC-MS/MS runs and an additional protein level separation step using microsol ief. The results showed that the 3-d method, which included microsol ief, provided superior protein and peptide coverage compared to the 2-d method with repetitive runs, identifying 3486 proteins with two or more peptides, which is 22% more than the 2-d method.

2. The study also evaluated the reproducibility of protein lists between the two methods and found that the apparent differences in protein identifications were due to limitations of current sequence databases and protein naming conventions, as well as software limitations for filtering database search results and building consensus protein lists. The reproducibility of protein lists between the two methods was quite high, with greater than 96% of the proteins identified in the 2-d/repetitive-run proteome observed within the complete 3-d data set.

1. The study aimed to compare the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) with tonsillectomy procedures. The study found a significant difference in the rate of hemorrhage between the two groups, with a lower incidence in the SMUPPP group.

2. The study included 404 patients who underwent either tonsillectomy or SMUPPP procedures between 2001 and 2010. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, who underwent tonsillectomy, and Group 2, who underwent SMUPPP. The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was 5.05% in Group 1 and 1.45% in Group 2.

3. The study suggested that the operative techniques used may be the reason for the increased rate of hemorrhage in the tonsillectomy group. Specifically, the study found that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding.

4. The study concluded that SMUPPP has a lower incidence of postoperative delayed hemorrhage compared to tonsillectomy using unipolar cautery in adult patients. The authors suggested routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.

1. The authors have developed a new method for the synthesis of - and -lactams using sulfone-substituted anhydrides through an anhydride Mannich reaction (AMR). This method allows for the synthesis of variously substituted - and -lactams with high diastereoselectivity.

2. The authors have synthesized several sulfone-substituted anhydrides, including 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, which were used as intermediates in the AMR. The syntheses of these anhydrides were achieved through conjugate addition, Michael addition, and ester cleavage.

3. The authors have demonstrated that the sulfone-substituted anhydrides react with imines to form -lactams with high yields and diastereoselectivity. The carboxylic acid intermediates were prone to facile decarboxylation, allowing for the isolation of the sulfone-substituted lactams.

4. The authors have also demonstrated that the AMR can be used to synthesize trisubstituted -lactams with good diastereomeric ratios. The reaction tolerated a variety of non-enolizable aldehydes and alkylamines.

5. The authors have applied the AMR to a formal synthesis of ( )-isoretronecanol, a biologically active natural product. The reaction of imine 16 with anhydride 3a followed by ring-closing metathesis provided the pyrrolizidine core of the natural product.

1. The study investigated the expression levels of five microRNAs (mir-125a, mir-206, mir-145, mir-21, and mir-10b) in breast cancer tissues and their relationship with clinical pathology. The results showed that mir-145 and mir-206 were negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis, while mir-21 was positively related to lymph node metastasis and positive HER-2 expression. Mir-125a and mir-206 were found to be related to negative HER-2 and negative PR expression.

2. The study also found that mir-145 and mir-206 may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and may be used as new target spots in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment. Additionally, mir-21, mir-125a, and mir-145 may contribute to the chemotherapy effect of epirubicin, and are important in guiding the development of chemotherapy for breast cancer. The study suggests that these microRNAs may be novel tumor markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.

1. The study investigated the expression of tissue transglutaminase 2 (tgm2) in mononuclear leukocytes and graft tissue during acute rejection in a rat model of renal transplantation. The results showed that tgm2 mRNA and protein were overexpressed by monocytes in the vascular bed of allografts on day 9 after transplantation, and this expression was associated with apoptosis and potentially contributed to the reversion of acute rejection.

2. The study also explored the role of tgm2 in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft injury (cai) and found that cystamine, a transglutaminase inhibitor, did not prevent the development of cai in the rat model. However, the study suggested that tgm2 may play a role in vascular remodeling and potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of cai, and further investigation is needed to clarify its functions in acute and chronic allograft rejection.

1. The study aimed to investigate the removal of endothelial microparticles (EMPs) from a modelled patient's circulation using counter-current dialysis with a standard clinical CVVH filter.

2. EMPs were isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and characterized using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

3. The study used a model patient with a 300 ml IV bag containing 0.9% NaCl, which was spiked with EMPs and connected to a primed CVVH circuit containing 170 ml of 0.9% NaCl.

4. The perfusate was circulated through the CVVH filter at a rate of 250 ml/hour for 70 minutes, and 0.5 ml aliquots were removed for flow cytometric analysis at 10-minute intervals.

5. The results showed that the decline in EMP levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes, and the circulating EMP levels were reduced to 29% of the starting concentration within 40 minutes.

6. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis, indicating that EMPs were being cleared from the patient's circulation.

7. The study suggests that CVVH is a meaningful therapeutic intervention in acute lung injury (ALI) due to the clearance of EMPs from the patient's circulation, and that this approach could be used to target both the molecular machinery and iatrogenic components of ALI.

8. However, the study notes that the observed EMP clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, and that a non-saturable clearance method would be required to achieve a lower steady-state EMP concentration.

9. The authors propose that combining a selective filter with convection and pressure gradients could substantially prolong EMP clearance, and that clinical data generally support the protective role of CVVH in ALI management.

1. Patients with frequent angina report greater physical limitations and decreased quality of life compared to those with minimal angina, highlighting the importance of effective management strategies. Optimal medical therapy, including anti-ischemic agents like nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, is as effective as revascularization in reducing the risk of adverse coronary events.

2. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin spray on time to onset of angina during exercise in patients with chronic stable angina. The results showed a dose-dependent increase in time to onset of moderate angina, with the 1.6-mg dose being the most effective. The study also found that the incidence of treatment-related adverse events increased with higher dose levels.

3. The study's findings support the use of sublingual nitroglycerin spray as nitrate therapy in patients with stable angina being managed with optimal medical therapy. This approach may also be beneficial for patients who have persistent angina post-revascularization. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term beneficial effects of using routine prophylactic nitroglycerin spray in patients with stable angina to increase exercise duration and improve quality of life and well-being.

1. The residual and resistant microorganisms, including fungi, are recognized as the primary cause of failures in root canal treatments, with Candida albicans being a key contributor to periradicular diseases.

2. Candida albicans has been found in 20% of endodontic treatment failures and is considered a dentinophilic microorganism, meaning it has a tendency to invade dentin.

3. The presence of Candida albicans in endodontic treatment failures may be due to coronal leakage after or contamination during the treatment, and its ability to survive despite a lack of nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials.

4. Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a widely used root-end filling material that has been approved by the US FDA and has excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, antimicrobial effects, and resistance to fluid and blood contamination.

5. MTA-Angelus is a variation of MTA that has been reported to have good marginal adaptation, sealing ability, and has been shown to be inflammation-free in most cases, with an excellent antibacterial effect and a strong fungicidal effect against Candida albicans.

6. A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set Proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus against Candida albicans at concentrations of 50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml.

7. The results showed that both materials were incapable of killing Candida albicans at 1 hour, but were effective in eliminating the fungus by the 24-h time point, with no significant difference between the two materials at either concentration or time point.

8. The study used a tube-dilution susceptibility test, which is an efficient method for evaluating antifungal characteristics of materials, and tested the materials in both freshly mixed and set states to mimic clinical use.

9. The study concluded that MTA-Angelus has an effective antifungal property comparable to Proroot MTA at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml, and that further studies are necessary to investigate the effect of these materials on bacteria and fungi in clinical application.

1. After a stroke, patients often experience deficits in motor and sensory functions on the side of the brain opposite to the damaged hemisphere, but recent studies suggest that the unaffected side may also be affected, with subtle motor deficits emerging during the acute phase and persisting chronically.

2. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to differentiate ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function on the ipsilateral side.

3. Recent studies have found kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb in performance of various specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.

4. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal track, or the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.

5. A study was conducted to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb of patients with stroke using a tracking and reposition sense test.

6. The study found that patients with stroke showed a lower accuracy index in the tracking task and higher error scores in the joint reposition test compared to sex- and age-matched normal subjects.

7. There was a significant correlation between ipsilateral sensory deficits and motor deficits, indicating that stroke patients would have difficulty performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions.

8. The study's findings suggest that interest in the ipsilateral side of stroke patients should focus on both ipsilateral sensory deficits and motor deficits, and that the difficulty stroke patients experience in task performance using the ipsilateral upper limb may be affected by both motor and sensory deficits.

The study began in 2001 and included 77,047 participants, with 55,021 completing follow-up surveys at year 3 and 54,790 at year 6.

2. The study found that incident diabetes was associated with several factors, including trouble sleeping, sleep duration, and sleep apnea. Participants who newly self-reported diabetes during follow-up were more likely to have reported trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours, and sleep apnea.

3. The study also found that military service characteristics, such as deployment without combat experience, administration or supply occupations, pay grade, and having separated from the military since baseline, were associated with a lower risk of diabetes.

4. Mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, were independently associated with a higher risk of diabetes.

5. The study found that sleep apnea and trouble sleeping had independent associations with diabetes risk, suggesting that the associations between sleep characteristics and diabetes risk do not merely serve as markers for the presence of sleep-disordered breathing.

6. The study's findings suggest that the associations between type 2 diabetes risk and mental health conditions and sleep characteristics may involve different pathways, and that the independent role of mental health conditions associated with poor quality and quantity of sleep in predicting risk of diabetes has only been addressed in a limited manner in previous research.

7. The study's strengths include its large sample size, up to 6-year duration of follow-up, and the adjustment for multiple diabetes risk factors and several mental health conditions, making it a valuable contribution to the understanding of the relationship between sleep characteristics and diabetes risk.

2. The patients were classified into three types based on the extent of the cystic component on CT scans: multiseptated cystic, mixed cystic and solid, and solid tumors.

3. The study found that the amount of hepatocytes was significantly different among the three types of tumors, with the solid tumors containing a moderate or abundant amount of hepatocytes.

4. The mesenchymal hamartomas showed multiple variable-sized cystic portions within the tumor in their gross morphology, and each tumor contained various amounts of myxoid or collagenous stroma and showed proliferation of the malformed bile ducts with periductal collaring of the stromal cells.

5. The study also found that the presence of intratumoral calcification was rare in mesenchymal hamartomas, but it was seen in one patient with a mixed solid and cystic tumor.

6. The radiological differential diagnosis of a solid mesenchymal hamartoma in children should include various hepatic tumors such as hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, infantile hemangioendothelioma, hepatic adenoma, or focal nodular hyperplasia.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects people of all ages, with a higher prevalence in women than in men, and its prevalence increases with age. The disease imposes a significant economic burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems, with costs expected to increase due to the aging population.

2. Studies have estimated the prevalence of RA in Italy to be around 0.5%, with a higher prevalence in women than in men, and the disease is expected to impose a heavy socioeconomic burden on the National Health Service (NHS) in the coming years due to demographic changes.

3. The costs associated with RA are likely to rise as the disease progresses, accompanied by a substantial reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and much of the cost of RA occurs outside the healthcare system due to loss of work capability and the need for informal care in the later stages of the disease.

4. Pharmacoeconomic analyses are essential to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches in patients with RA in Italy, taking into account the effects of treatments on disease progression, HRQoL, and indirect and social costs, and to guide treatment decisions to ensure effective spending without compromising the quality of care delivered.

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third most common cause of global cancer-related mortality, with a disproportionate impact on developing countries and males. The risk factors for HCC development include chronic liver inflammation, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and genetic metabolic diseases. The prognosis and therapeutic options for HCC are dependent on the severity of underlying liver disease, and the median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced disease is estimated at 58 months.

2. The HGF-CMET pathway plays a crucial role in HCC development and progression, and its dysregulation is implicated in various mechanisms of pathogenic activation, including aberrant paracrine or autocrine ligand production, overexpression of HGF and MET, and upregulation of genes encoding proteases for HGF-CMET processing. Inhibition of the HGF-CMET pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy in HCC, and several MET inhibitors, including tivantinib and cabozantinib, have shown efficacy in clinical trials. However, the development of predictive biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from MET inhibitors is an urgent and unmet need.

1. The association between diabetes and cancer has been debated for over a century, with most practicing diabetologists not viewing cancer as a specific risk in day-to-day practice. However, recent studies have confirmed that type 2 diabetes confers increased risk for certain types of malignancies, particularly breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors.

2. Insulin therapy, especially with long-acting insulin analogues like glargine, has raised concerns about its potential to promote cancer growth due to its ability to bind and activate the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor.

3. A study in Germany found that glargine was associated with a greater risk of malignancy compared to human insulin, with the risk increasing with higher doses. However, the study had several limitations, including the lack of prospective allocation to treatment groups and the exclusion of patients on combination insulin therapy.

4. Three additional studies were commissioned to confirm or refute the findings of the initial study. A study in Sweden found that women on glargine alone had a higher risk of breast cancer, but not an increased mortality rate. A study in Scotland found no increased risk of total or site-specific cancer associated with overall glargine use, but exclusive use of glargine did seem to confer higher risk.

5. A study in the UK found that any type of insulin therapy increased the risk of occurrence of solid tumors, but concomitant metformin therapy attenuated this effect. The study also found that glargine displayed comparable rates to other human insulins, suggesting no added risk attributable to glargine.

6. A systematic review of 31 trials comparing glargine to other agents found no evidence for an increased risk of malignancy attributable to glargine. However, the majority of the studies had a short duration of exposure and follow-up, which limited their conclusions.

7. The controversy surrounding the use of glargine has been criticized for being emotive and sensationalized, with some experts arguing that the analytical flaws in the studies have raised unsubstantiated anxieties. Despite the controversy, the current evidence does not warrant any change in clinical practice, and further research is needed to address the relationship between diabetes, insulin, and cancer.

2. The tumor has been associated with osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia, and some cases may represent a spectrum of disease with progression from osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia to adamantinoma.

3. Adamantinoma of the tibia can be divided into two main groups based on their histology and biological behavior: classical adamantinoma and differentiated adamantinoma.

4. Classical adamantinoma is associated with a destructive growth pattern on radiology and has a higher potential for distant metastases, while differentiated adamantinoma has a predominance of osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia-like pattern and is commonly seen in an intracortical location.

5. Distant metastases have been reported in adamantinoma of the long bones in about 15-20% of cases, and regional or other distant metastases are found more frequently in patients who have a history of repeated local recurrences.

6. The current practice recommends surgical extirpation as the primary mode of treatment for localized regional lymph node metastases, with radiotherapy and chemotherapy as suggested alternatives, and continuous long-term follow-up is recommended for patients with tibial adamantinoma due to its slow-growing nature.

2. A relatively low-light reflectivity can be obtained for crystalline silicon solar cells by combining surface texturization with thin-film deposition, but further reduction in light reflectivity is necessary for improved solar cell efficiency.

3. Various nanostructures with sizes comparable to the wavelength of most utilized solar spectrum have been proposed, including photonic crystals, porous structures, and plasmonic structures.

4. Subwavelength structures such as nanowires, nanocones, frustum nanorods, and biomimetic nanostructures have been explored for antireflective applications.

5. Zinc oxide (ZnO) material has a wide bandgap and has been widely used in photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices, making it a suitable material for antireflective layers in solar cells.

6. ZnO nanostructures can be fabricated using various approaches, including pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and hydrothermal method, but a seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions is considered a low-cost and scalable method.

7. Experiments have shown that ZnO nanorod arrays can exhibit better antireflective properties than other oxide compounds, with a weighted global reflectance of 6.6% achieved in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm.

8. Researchers have grown ZnO nanowhiskers (NWs) with different lengths using the seeding and growth two-step process and integrated them into the fabrication of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells.

10. The study demonstrates that ZnO NWs grown for 45 minutes can improve the efficiency of solar cells by 3%, corresponding to an increment of short-circuit current density and fill factor, but long-time immersion of solar cells in aqueous solution during the ZnO NW growth process can deteriorate the solar cell performance drastically.

2. Accurate and early diagnosis is crucial for correct management and prognostication, and molecular imaging techniques, such as PET or SPECT, have improved diagnostic accuracy for PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes.

3. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and sympathetic innervation of the heart have become popular in clinical practice, with imaging of DAT binding successfully visualizing presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract.

4. DAT SPECT abnormalities can help support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism, but cannot differentiate between various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy.

5. A retrospective study compared the results of SPECT studies of striatal DAT receptors and myocardial MIBG scintigraphy with clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of combined SPECT imaging.

6. The study found that the combined use of DAT SPECT and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy improved diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between PD and non-PD, with a sensitivity of 86.7%, specificity of 73.7%, accuracy of 79.4%, positive predictive value of 72.2%, and negative predictive value of 87.5%.

7. The study also found that the sensitivity and specificity of MIBG scintigraphy in differentiating PD from non-PD were 93% and 47%, respectively, and that the combination of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy may improve the sensitivity of PD diagnosis.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, with predominant involvement of the interventricular septum, and is often caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins.

2. The TNNT2 gene is one of the major genes causing HCM, and mutations in this gene have been associated with a poor prognosis and a high incidence of sudden death, despite mild left ventricular hypertrophy.

3. A study of 173 Japanese patients with familial HCM identified three reported mutations and a new mutation of TNNT2 in 11 individuals from four families, and found that the phenotype of each family was often different from reported cases, even if they had the same genetic mutation.

4. The study found that sudden death in youth was observed in all of these families, and that the type of genetic mutation of TNNT2 did not seem useful in distinguishing the prognosis, but if mutations were found, there was a risk of sudden death in youth.

The Schistosoma genus is the best-studied genus, with six species infecting humans causing schistosomiasis, and other species infecting a broad range of mammals.

2. The Schistosoma genome and transcriptome data have been extensively studied, with the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of some species being completely sequenced. This has led to a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships among schistosomes, the identification of conserved features, and the discovery of new genes and gene families. The data has also been used to develop new tools for schistosomiasis diagnostics and treatment.

3. Despite the progress made, there are still many questions regarding the biology and evolution of schistosomes that remain unanswered. The size of schistosome genomes, the complexity of their life cycle, and the presence of rare features in posttranscriptional regulation are some of the challenges that need to be addressed. However, the availability of schistosome genome and transcriptome data has provided an unprecedented resource for many research areas, and with continued data integration and interpretation, it is expected that the goals of current and future initiatives to improve human health will be met.

1. For patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sclm), hepatic resection is considered the best treatment, with reported 5-year survival rates between 23% and 37%. However, the optimal surgical strategy for resectable sclm remains controversial, with simultaneous resection and staged resections being two of the main approaches.

2. A study of 86 patients who underwent simultaneous resection for sclm found that the overall morbidity rate was 64%, with anastomotic leakage being the most frequent complication. Predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage were intraoperative blood loss and operation time greater than 8 hours, respectively.

3. The study also found that the presence of a diverting stoma was not a predictive factor for absence of postoperative anastomotic leakage, and that the site of primary tumor was not a predictive factor for anastomotic leakage in this series. However, the analysis estimating efficacy of a diverting stoma in this study was not accurate.

4. Based on the results of this study, the authors now select staged resections when operation time is expected to be greater than 8 hours; otherwise, they select simultaneous resection. A prospective study of sclm to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the operation time-based decision model is in progress.

1. The study aimed to validate two scores for assessing the ability of patients to use metered dose inhalers (MDIs) or dry powder inhalers (DPIs), identify common errors, and determine the need for educational programs.

2. The study was conducted in three phases: validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, assessment of the content validity of the two scores, and assessment of the criterion validity and discriminant validity of the instruments.

3. The study used a convenience sample of 16 patients for the first two phases and a sample of 72 patients for the third phase, which was calculated based on a hypothesis of an association of at least 60% between the scores given by the pharmacists.

4. The results showed that the most common difficulty encountered during the use of both types of devices was the maintenance of total lung capacity (TLC) after a deep inhalation, with 83% and 75% of patients making this error for MDIs and DPIs, respectively.

5. The study also found that incorrect inhaler use affects drug efficacy, and the authors reported that assessment of inhaler technique is still considered irrelevant by many health professionals.

6. The study validated objective MDI and DPI technique scores that can reveal the major difficulties encountered by patients using MDIs or DPIs and provided cut-off scores that can be used to classify patients as being able or unable to use their inhalers.

7. The study found that the proportion of MDI technique errors was higher than that of DPI technique errors, which may be related to the fact that the correct DPI technique is more easily understandable to patients than the correct MDI technique.

8. The study concluded that the validated scores can be used to identify and correct inhaler technique errors during visits and improve inhaler use, and that the new MDI and DPI scores will allow the implementation of educational programs proposed in asthma management guidelines and strategies.

1. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that have potential applications in food preservation and human and veterinary medicine. They can be classified into four classes, including class I (lantibiotics), class II, class III, and class IV.

2. The classification of gram-positive bacteriocins is challenging due to their heterogeneity, and new classification schemes have been proposed as more bacteriocins are identified.

3. Enterococcal strains, including Enterococcus faecalis, have been characterized as antagonists of a broad range of foodborne pathogens and have been isolated from various ecosystems, including food, broilers, and animal secretions.

4. The bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis S37, named enterocin S37, was isolated from chicken feces and exhibited activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and other bacteria.

5. Enterocin S37 was purified using a three-step method, including ammonium sulfate precipitation and two RP-HPLC steps, and its molecular weight was determined to be between 4 and 6 kDa.

6. The mode of action of enterocin S37 was studied, and it was found to interact with cell membranes, leading to the formation of pores and the loss of intracellular components, resulting in cell death.

7. The combination of enterocin S37 with potassium channel modulators, such as pinacidil and cromakalim, enhanced its inhibitory activity against sensitive strains of Listeria monocytogenes, while the resistant variant was affected by the combination of enterocin S37 and pinacidil.

1. The phase 1 study involved 28 children with spinal muscular atrophy who underwent a total of 73 lumbar punctures for cerebrospinal fluid collection and/or intrathecal drug administration. The majority of the procedures (68%) had no complications, while 32% of the procedures were associated with adverse events, most commonly headache, back pain, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome.

2. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest incidence of adverse events was reported in older children, children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3, and when a larger 21- or 22-gauge needle was used. Using a 24-gauge needle or smaller atraumatic needle inserted with the bevel parallel to the dura fibers had been suggested to considerably reduce damage to the dura and consequently decrease the risk for cerebrospinal fluid leak after lumbar puncture.

3. The study found that intrathecal delivery of medication is feasible, safe, and well-tolerated in children with spinal muscular atrophy. Bed rest, adequate hydration, oral caffeine, and/or analgesics were sufficient to resolve post-lumbar puncture headache/syndrome without the need of a therapeutic blood patch in all patients. The study's experience may prove useful for guiding the development of best practice strategies for safe and effective intrathecal delivery of nusinersen and/or other promising emerging therapies for spinal muscular atrophy.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 3}

1. The main concern in healthcare services is to ensure the highest possible standard and meet the needs of individual service users and communities. In 1997, the UK Department of Health introduced Clinical Governance (CG) as a strategy for improving quality of healthcare services.

2. The Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) has applied CG as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009, using a model developed in Iran that consists of seven interlocking components.

3. A study was conducted to explore senior managers' viewpoints on the facilitators and barriers in CG implementation in Iranian medical universities, using qualitative research and interviews with 43 deputies for curative affairs.

4. The study found that sufficient knowledge and clear understanding about the principles and practice of CG, supporting culture, appropriate organizational structure, and managerial commitment are perceived facilitators in CG implementation.

5. The main identified obstacles were lack of adequate managerial support, resources, structural and cultural issues, and professional boundaries, which are consistent with findings from other studies.

6. The study emphasized the importance of involving staff in quality improvement activities, having a positive attitude towards quality, and employing quality management practices, as well as the need for top management support and realistic timetables to secure cultural and organizational changes.

7. The authors concluded that developing educational courses and workshops to raise staff awareness, developing a supportive culture, and overcoming legal challenges are possible solutions to facilitate the implementation of CG, ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare professionals.

1. Hydatid cyst disease, caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus parasite, is a zoonotic disease that affects humans and animals, with canines being the final host and herbivores and humans being intermediate hosts. The disease is common in many parts of the world, particularly in countries with animal husbandry, and has a high health and economic burden.

2. In Iran, which is considered a hyper-endemic area for hydatidosis, the prevalence rate of the disease in humans has been reported to be between 1.1% and 13.7%, with the highest prevalence rate found in the Khorasan Razavi province. The study found that the majority of patients were women, with a mean age of 39.13 years, and the most common symptoms were abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and chest pain.

3. The study's findings highlight the need for public health interventions, including education and awareness programs, to prevent the spread of the disease, particularly in high-risk groups such as farmers and animal handlers. The study also emphasizes the importance of improving hygiene practices, such as washing vegetables properly, to reduce the risk of infection.

1. Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare congenital malformations that have been reported in approximately 103 cases worldwide since their first description by Friderich in 1857. They are typically solitary, unilocular, and have four distinct layers: an outer fibrous rim, a layer of smooth muscle, subepithelial connective tissue, and a lining of ciliated, pseudo-stratified, mucin-secreting columnar epithelium.

2. CHFCs are most commonly located superficially in the median segments of the liver (segments IV, V, VIII) and are rarely multiloculated or septated. They are mostly asymptomatic, but can present with abdominal symptoms, and are often found incidentally on imaging studies or at autopsy. The average age of presentation is 52 years, with a slight female predominance.

3. The recommended treatment for CHFCs is surgical excision, particularly for cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and asymptomatic lesions with wall abnormalities on imaging. Laparoscopic excision is a minimally invasive approach that can be effective for removing these benign cysts, especially for lesions located in segments II to VI of the liver.

1. The oral route of drug administration is preferred due to its safety, ease of administration, and acceptability by patients, with about 60% of conventional dosage forms available as oral solid dosage forms. However, the low bioavailability, longer onset of action, and difficulty in swallowing of tablets and capsules have led to the development of alternative dosage forms such as fast-dissolving tablets and orally dissolving strips.

2. Orally dissolving strips are a new technology that has gained attention due to their flexibility, comfort, and ability to dissolve quickly in the oral cavity without the need for water or chewing. They are useful in patients such as pediatrics, geriatrics, bedridden, and emetic patients, and conditions such as sudden episodes of allergic attacks or coughing.

3. The study aimed to design, characterize, and optimize orally dissolving strips of clobazam, a well-tolerated and effective antiepileptic drug, using a 3 full factorial design to evaluate the influence of film-forming polymer (PVA) and disintegrating agent (SSG) on the film's mechanical properties, disintegration time, and dissolution rate. The optimized formulation (F6) showed a high dissolution rate, suitable in vitro disintegration time, and satisfactory tensile strength, and was found to be stable for at least 6 months.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 3}

1. The review aimed to systematically examine the outcome measures used in stroke self-management interventions (smis) and their methodological quality, reliability, and validity for stroke populations. The review identified 43 different outcome measures used in stroke smis, with 21 measures (49%) demonstrating some properties in stroke populations according to the COSMIN checklist.

2. The majority of measures used in stroke smis focused on health outcomes, such as physical functioning, mood, and quality of life, rather than capturing the process of self-management. The review also found that most measures did not score well according to the COSMIN criteria, with only 15% scoring ""good"" for responsiveness.

3. The review highlighted the importance of involving potential users in the development of outcome measures to enhance content validity and clinical utility. It also emphasized the need for further research to conceptualize stroke self-management and develop robust outcome measures that accurately reflect the concept.

4. The review concluded that the current evidence base for stroke smis is limited by the lack of consensus surrounding which outcome measures to utilize, the imprecision of the causal mechanisms of stroke smis, and the need for further work to conceptualize stroke self-management and develop robust outcome measures to enable evaluation of stroke smis.

1. The study aimed to investigate the correlation between the KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire and objective measures such as the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) in patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The results showed that the 6-MWT had a strong correlation with KOOS symptom, pain, and sports subscales, and a very strong correlation with KOOS quality of life (QOL) subscale.

2. The study also found that BMI had a strong correlation with KOOS pain, symptom, activity of daily living (ADL), and sports subscales, and a very strong correlation with KOOS QOL subscale. Weight had a weak correlation with KOOS symptom, ADL, and sports subscales, and a strong correlation with KOOS pain and QOL subscales. Age had a weak correlation with KOOS QOL subscale, but no correlation with other KOOS subscales.

3. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have investigated the correlation between self-reported questionnaires and objective measures in patients with OA of the knee. The results suggest that the KOOS questionnaire can be a useful tool for assessing the symptoms and functional limitations of patients with OA of the knee, and that BMI and weight are important factors to consider in the management of OA.

1. Obesity has become a global issue due to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and rising consumption of caloric foods, leading to a low-level, chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial etiology.

2. Adipose tissue not only serves as an energy reservoir and heat insulator but also secretes cell-signaling molecules such as adipokines, which can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory.

3. Studies have shown that a high-fat diet in rodents promotes metabolic changes, inducing the production of pro-inflammatory interleukins and a chronic inflammatory process, which can be triggered by the presence of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet.

4. Menopause is a significant factor in women's health, particularly in combination with obesity, as it leads to adverse changes in lipoprotein profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, body fat distribution, clotting, and vascular endothelium, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

5. The study found that administration of a hyperlipidic diet combined with short-term ovariectomy in rats caused hyperleptinemia, increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content, which may contribute to the induction of pro-inflammatory processes, particularly those associated with a high-fat diet.

1. Hemoptysis is a common symptom in patients with respiratory diseases, and when massive, it has a mortality rate of over 50%. Therefore, significant or life-threatening hemoptysis requires quick treatment to stop bleeding.

2. In the past, the control of hemoptysis was obtained using surgical methods if conservative management failed to be effective, but patients with massive hemoptysis may be associated with high morbidity and mortality using conservative or surgical management.

3. A retrospective study was undertaken to determine the demographic characteristics, clinical features, results of imaging techniques, complications related to BAE (Bronchial Artery Embolization), and follow-up of 344 patients who underwent BAE.

4. The study found that 317 patients (92.2%) were suggestive of causes of hemoptysis, and 27 patients (7.8%) showed focal hemorrhage. Blood lobe could be identified by chest CT scan in 105 cases (30.5%).

5. The findings of angiography suggested that few direct signs were found during arteriography, and most of the indirect appearances that support a site of bleeding include tortuosity, hypertrophy, hypervascularity, aneurysms, extravasation, and bronchial artery to pulmonary artery or vein shunting.

6. Bronchial artery embolization was performed in 336 of 344 patients (97.7%), and artery spasm and closure occurred in six patients, arterial subintimal dissection occurred in one patient, and the responsible vessel could not be super-selective in one patient.

7. The study concluded that bronchial artery embolization was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 330 of 344 patients (96%). Recurrent bleeding despite apparently adequate embolotherapy remains a considerable problem, with rebleeding occurring in 61 of 344 patients (17.7%) within 30 days.

8. The etiologies of hemoptysis included tuberculosis (55.2%), bronchiectasis (28.8%), malignancy (5.8%), undefined (5.2%), pneumonia (1.8%), deformity of bronchial artery (1.8%), bronchial artery aneurysm (0.2%), and other pulmonary disease (1.2%).

1. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, celiac disease (CD), and lymphocytic gastritis (LG) in pediatric patients. The researchers sought to determine the contribution of HP and CD to LG and to characterize the different immunophenotypes of the gastric inflammatory cells involved in these diseases.

2. The study included 40 patients, divided into four groups: normal controls, patients with new active CD without HP infection, patients with HP infection without CD, and patients with both CD and HP infection.

3. The researchers found that the highest prevalence of LG was in pediatric CD patients, followed by CD patients with HP infection, HP-positive patients without CD, and none in the control group.

4. The study showed that patients infected with HP had the highest number of lymphoid aggregates, regardless of CD status. CD patients with HP infection showed a lower rate of LG compared to those without HP infection.

5. The researchers found that CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were significantly higher in CD patients compared to controls or HP-infected patients without CD. This may imply that CD is the diagnosis rather than HP gastritis in undiagnosed patients with histological features compatible with LG.

6. The study also found that the expression of CD57 in lymphoid cells was low in both CD and HP pathologies, indicating that natural killer cells may play a negligible role in these two pathologies.

7. The researchers suggested that the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum might hint towards the diagnosis of CD rather than HP infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles might direct towards the diagnosis of HP infection in undefined cases of CD.

1. The process of angiogenesis, which is essential for the growth of solid tumors, involves the formation of new blood vessels through the binding and activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to its receptors. Inhibiting angiogenesis with anti-VEGF therapies, such as bevacizumab, has shown promise in reducing tumor growth and metastasis in various types of cancer, including breast cancer.

2. Anti-VEGF therapies not only inhibit angiogenesis but also modulate the immune cell infiltration in tumors, reducing the number of macrophages, neutrophils, and other immune cells that contribute to tumor growth and progression. This suggests that anti-VEGF therapies may have a broader impact on cancer treatment beyond just inhibiting angiogenesis, and may be used in combination with conventional chemotherapy or as a preventive therapy in the future.

1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common medical condition in postmenopausal women, resulting from the loss of estrogen stimulation on vaginal and vulvar tissue, affecting an estimated 32 million women in the United States.

2. VVA symptoms include dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation, which can negatively impact women's quality of life, including sexual relationships and emotional well-being.

3. A recent survey, the Revive survey, found that many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its associated symptoms, with only approximately one-quarter of women specifically identifying menopause as the cause of their symptoms.

4. The survey also found that almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP), with 40% of women with VVA symptoms expecting HCPs to initiate the conversation.

5. The most common reasons for not mentioning symptoms to HCPs were the assumption that symptoms were a natural part of aging or were not bothersome enough at that time, with 73% of women who initiated discussions waiting until a scheduled physical examination.

6. The Revive survey demonstrated the considerable impact of VVA on women's lives, with the most commonly reported VVA symptoms being vaginal dryness (55%), dyspareunia (44%), and local irritation (37%), and more than half of participants reporting that VVA had the greatest impact on enjoyment of sex.

7. The survey found that only 35% of postmenopausal women currently on any treatment for VVA were satisfied with their current treatment, with women using vaginal estrogen generally more satisfied than women using OTC lubricants or moisturizers.

8. Effective patient education and communication between women and HCPs are crucial in bridging the gap in understanding and treatment of VVA, with HCPs being in a position to proactively identify women suffering from VVA and provide essential patient education.

9. The Revive survey offers important insights on VVA from postmenopausal women experiencing undesirable vaginal symptoms, highlighting the need for increased vigilance by HCPs caring for postmenopausal women and the importance of proactive patient education on the physical changes underlying VVA and how the condition can progress if left untreated.

1. In Denmark, women planning to conceive are advised to take a daily supplement of 400 μg folic acid (FA) until the 12th week of gestation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs).

2. Despite campaigns promoting the FA recommendation in Denmark in 1999 and 2001, women in the preconceptional period appear to have neither adequate dietary intake of folate nor adequate supplementation from FA tablets or multivitamin (MV) supplements.

3. A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an internet-based prospective cohort study of Danish pregnancy planners found that 62.1% of the participants used FA or MV supplements, with 7.7% using FA supplements exclusively, 20.4% using MV supplements exclusively, and 34.0% using both.

4. The study identified several predictors of FA or MV supplement use, including higher age, higher education, longer vocational training, higher income, and engagement in physical activity.

5. Women who had a previous spontaneous abortion, had intercourse frequency of 1 time per week, and had a pap smear once or more during the last 3 years were more likely to use FA or MV supplements.

6. In contrast, women who smoked, had a higher BMI, and consumed more alcohol were less likely to use FA or MV supplements.

7. The study found that 32% of the participants reported no alcohol intake, and the lowest proportion of FA or MV users was among women with the highest alcohol intake.

8. The findings suggest that more than one-third of the pregnancy planners in this study do not follow the preconceptional FA recommendation, and that pregnancy planners with other risky behaviors are less likely to comply with the FA recommendation or use MVs.

1. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition characterized by the progressive narrowing of arteries in the lower extremities due to atherosclerosis, which is a significant predictor of coronary and cerebral vascular risk. The most common symptomatic manifestation of mild to moderate atherosclerotic PAD is intermittent claudication, observed in approximately 5% of individuals older than 60 years.

2. Oxidative stress, through the extra generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is involved in the development and progression of PAD. Risk factors associated with PAD, similar to those for coronary heart disease, include high blood concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs, have been shown to reduce lipid levels and have pleiotropic effects, including improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress.

3. The study aimed to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of patients with PAD before surgery and after surgery, as well as in patients receiving simvastatin therapy. The results showed that patients with PAD had elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products, such as MDA, and reduced antioxidant capacity compared to patients on simvastatin therapy. The study also found that statin therapy reduced lipid peroxidation and improved antioxidant capacity in patients with PAD.

4. The findings of the study suggest that lipid peroxidation may be one mechanism through which several risk factors promote PAD. The results provide strong support for the efficacy of statin therapy in PAD and highlight the importance of antioxidant therapy in reducing oxidative stress and improving outcomes in patients with PAD.

Additionally, the study found that the Fijk mixture caused lipid peroxidation and potentiated hepatic lesions, including hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, hyperemia, and inflammation.

2. The study's findings suggest that the Fijk herbal mixture may have toxic effects on the liver and cardiovascular system, and that its repeated consumption may lead to oxidative stress and tissue damage.

2. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies have started offering preconceptional carrier tests, which provide information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring, but their services are often criticized for lacking medical supervision and follow-up.

3. The traditional healthcare system has hesitated to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy, citing concerns about the psychological impact, risk of stigmatization, and medicalization, as well as provider-related barriers such as a lack of familiarity with genetics.

4. The large number of monogenic disorders included in DTC genetic testing companies' services challenges the established specifications for carrier testing, including the condition being an important health problem and the test having known predictive value.

5. The DTC offer of genetic tests raises concerns about the validity and utility of tests offered, the absence of individualized medical supervision, the lack of an adequate consent procedure, and the potential burden on public health resources.

6. Involving a physician in the DTC offer of genetic tests may not solve many of the concerns, as physicians may not be well-educated about which tests should be given based on specific criteria, and regulatory oversight is necessary to ensure the quality of testing services and the provision of pretest information and genetic counselling.

1. The study aimed to investigate the commonest indications of implant removal and to detect which implants were most likely to require removal. The study was conducted prospectively on patients admitted for removal of implants in the orthopedics department of a teaching hospital.

2. The most common reasons for implant removal were found to be pain/discomfort/prominence (39.75%), infection (28.91%), implant failure (9.52%), elective removal (20.48%), and other reasons (1.19%). The mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher (49.33 years) than those with pain (31.6 years) or implant failure (35 years).

3. The study found that majority of patients that needed removal of implant were men (85.5%), and the most frequently removed implants in the series were distal tibial/ankle plates (14.45%), femoral I.M. nails (13.25%), olecranon wires and plates (12.04%), and tibial I.M. nails and patellar TBWs (9.53% each).

4. The study also found that the incidence of infections is likely to rise as more operations are performed by the day, and longevity increases translating into greater periods of possible bacterial implant seeding in the body. The removed implant should be sonicated in saline to dislodge microorganisms from its surface and the resultant sonicated fluid should be sent for microbiologic examination.

5. The study concluded that routine removal in asymptomatic patients should not be practiced, and if at all necessary, the removal should not require a larger procedure than the index operation. The removal surgery may not entirely fulfill the intended purpose, and additional surgeries may be required, and all these factors must be borne in mind before embarking on such a process with high hopes of success.

1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy, with multiple factors contributing to its development, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.

2. Müller cells, a type of glial cell in the mammalian retina, play a crucial role in supporting and nourishing retinal neurons, maintaining extracellular ion homeostasis, and recycling glutamate.

3. Investigations have shown that Müller cells are involved in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma, and can release cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) that can aggravate retinal damage.

4. The study aimed to determine if 2-aminoadipic acid (AAA) treatment inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities induced in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.

5. The study used a rat model of AOH, where IOP was increased to 110 mmHg for 60 minutes, and AAA was injected into the vitreous humor after 3 hours of AOH induction.

6. The results showed that AAA treatment significantly attenuated Müller cell gliosis, as indicated by reduced GFAP immunoreactivity, and downregulated TNF-α protein production in the retinas of the rat model of AOH.

7. AAA treatment also rescued RGCs from apoptosis and reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ganglion cell layer, indicating a protective effect on RGCs.

8. The study suggested that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma, as it inhibited Müller cell gliosis and downregulated TNF-α production.

9. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of glaucoma and suggest a potential therapeutic approach using AAA to protect against RGC loss and apoptosis in glaucoma.

2. The LAEFTR-L procedure involves mobilizing the duodenum, ligating the tumor with a ligation device, temporarily suturing the seromuscular layer, and then resecting the targeted lesion under the ligation band using a snare technique, allowing for the collection of the resected specimen intraluminally and avoiding contact with the peritoneum.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by defects in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, leading to cortisol and/or mineralocorticoid deficiency. The most common form, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), accounts for 90-95% of CAH cases and is characterized by signs of androgen excess, including ambiguous genitalia in females and rapid somatic growth in both sexes.

2. The management of CAH involves the administration of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. However, patients with CAH are at risk of developing adrenal tumors, particularly with chronic poor compliance to therapy. Regular follow-up imaging is recommended to monitor for the appearance of adrenal tumors, and patients should maintain steroid medication to avoid tumor development and improve symptoms and electrolyte disorders.

1. The study examined the relationship between self-rated health (SRH) and lifestyle behaviors, including dietary and physical activity, in a population largely comprised of Hispanics with a considerable proportion of blacks. The results showed that modifiable lifestyle behaviors known to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, such as low fruits and vegetables intake and high fat intake, were associated with poor/fair SRH in males and females.

2. The study found significant differences in SRH between males and females, with females reporting poorer SRH and being less physically active. Logistic regression models showed that females who consumed 2 servings of fruits and vegetables per day were 2.1 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH as compared to those who consumed 5 servings per day.

3. The study also found that physical activity was strongly associated with SRH in females, with those who engaged in less physical activity being more likely to report poor/fair SRH. In contrast, the association between physical activity and SRH was no longer significant for males once adjustment variables were added.

4. The study's results are consistent with previous studies that have found a positive association between physical activity and SRH, regardless of gender. However, the study's findings on gender differences in physical activity levels and SRH are in agreement with several other studies that have found that women tend to rate their health worse in health and behavioral studies.

5. The study's results have implications for designing and monitoring lifestyle interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases, particularly in populations with a high proportion of Hispanics and blacks. The study's findings suggest that gender differences may be an important consideration in the development of such interventions.

2. Deflux, a DX/HA copolymer, has been FDA-approved since 2001 for treating grade 2-4 VUR in children above one year of age with single systems and no accompanying urological malformations.

3. The operative ease, short procedure, and recovery time of DX/HA injection have made it a popular treatment option among surgeons and parents.

4. Reports of expanded use of DX/HA injection to patients of all ages and grades of VUR, even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies, have been published worldwide.

5. The initial success rate of DX/HA injection was quoted as 68%, but has improved to 75-89% in some studies, with an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection.

6. The study compared two different pic cystography techniques and evaluated their ability to detect de novo contralateral VUR in patients with preoperative unilateral VUR and to predict a successful surgical outcome.

7. The study found that there was no statistically significant difference between the two pic cystography techniques for detecting de novo VUR, and that only 5 renal units were found to have remaining VUR intraoperatively after DX/HA injection.

8. The postoperative standard VCUG detected 20-36 renal units to be positive for VUR, resulting in an overall success rate of 80% for renal units and 75% for patients.

9. The study concluded that pic cystography is not useful to raise the success rate of DX/HA injection, and that a negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative VCUG in only 80%, highlighting the need for postoperative studies to confirm the success of the procedure.

1. The accuracy of detecting fetal pathology using ultrasound depends on the expertise of the sonographer and the limitations of the imaging technique, which can be affected by factors such as fetal head descent, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios.

2. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies, particularly for central nervous system pathology, due to advances in technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology.

3. Ventriculomegaly, or the enlargement of the ventricles in the brain, is a common finding in fetal MRI studies, and its prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 1.5%. The severity of ventriculomegaly can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe.

4. Fetal MRI has a high sensitivity for detecting small deposits of intraventricular blood, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and other cerebral anomalies, making it a valuable tool for characterizing additional malformations associated with ventriculomegaly.

5. The added value of fetal MRI in cases of ventriculomegaly is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to various factors, including the lack of postnatal or postmortem correlates, the uncertainty of the time span between prenatal ultrasound and MRI, and the a priori knowledge of ultrasound findings by the fetal MRI specialist.

6. Fetal MRI is particularly useful in detecting small foci of brain hemorrhage or callosal anomalies in the second trimester and in assessing normal and pathological cortical development and maturation later in pregnancy.

1. The study found that among patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed lung cancer, 19.8% presented with or subsequently had evidence of a possible bone metastasis, and 51% of these patients had one or more skeletal-related events (SREs). The most common SRE was radiotherapy to bone, followed by fracture, spinal cord compression, and surgery to bone.

2. The study found a positive association between bone metastasis and mortality in all categories of age groups (65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+). The hazard ratio (HR) for death was 2.4 (95% CI = 2.4-2.5) for patients with bone metastasis but no SRE and for patients with bone metastasis plus SRE, compared to patients without bone metastasis.

3. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that reported the prevalence of bone metastasis among patients with non-small cell lung cancer to range from 8% to 34% before the advent of newer imaging techniques, and 24% to 30% with the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in the 1990s. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering bone metastasis as a prognostic factor in lung cancer patients, particularly in those with distant stage disease.

1. Fiber-reinforced posts have superior advantages over cast posts, including better esthetics, physical properties, and a modulus of elasticity similar to root dentin, making them a popular choice for dental restorations.

2. The success of fiber post restorations depends on the proper selection of resin cements, which can influence the retention of the post and the overall success of the restoration.

3. Self-adhesive resin cements are a relatively uninvestigated group of resin cements, but they have shown promise due to their ability to reduce application steps and provide satisfactory esthetic and mechanical properties.

4. The removal of the smear layer, which contains gutta-percha remnants, microorganisms, and infectious dentin, is necessary for the penetration of the adhesive system and resin cement into the dentin tubules, but self-adhesive resin cements may not be able to completely remove the smear layer.

5. Various chemical substances, including sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), and orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), can be used to remove the smear layer and alter the characteristics of the dentin substrate, but their effectiveness can vary.

6. A study was conducted to compare the effect of photodynamic diode laser and other smear layer removal methods on the bond strength of self-adhesive cement, and the results showed that the photodynamic diode laser was more effective than other methods in increasing the bond strength of the cement to dentin.

7. The study concluded that the removal of the smear layer and the formation of the resin-dentin interdiffusion zone are important for improving the bonding effectiveness of the resin and dentin, and that the photodynamic diode laser may be a valuable tool for achieving this goal.

1. Recent years have seen concerted efforts to identify, describe, and quantify the bacterial communities of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, with many international consortia and collaborations established to answer the question of who is present in the gut and what they are doing there.

2. The Human Microbiome Project in the USA and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives aimed at characterizing the microbial communities that inhabit multiple sites in the human body and looking for correlations between the changes in the microbiome and the prevalence of diseases.

3. Studies have shown that the human gut flora belongs mainly to two phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and that the diversity of archaea is a fraction of the expansiveness of the bacterial species colonizing the gut.

4. The composition of the bacterial flora seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and upon breastfeeding, and recent second-generation, high-throughput studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, including the identification of a common bacterial core shared by all or at least a majority of humans.

5. The concept of enterotypes, which proposes that the human gut microbiome can be classified into three distinct clusters, has been proposed, and studies have shown that the enterotype is associated with long-term diet and that the enterotype does not seem to budge easily.

6. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating host energy balance and metabolism, and changes in the gut microbiota have been linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases, and the microbiome can also interact with the host tissues by tweaking host gene expression, and the use of probiotics has been shown to have a positive effect on human metabolic health.

1. Onychomycosis, a chronic fungal infection of the nail, is characterized by nail discoloration, thickening, and defect, and is often caused by dermatophytes, yeasts (Candida), and non-dermatophytes. The most common agents of onychomycosis are Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, which account for 50-90% of cases.

2. The treatment of onychomycosis is often difficult due to the slow nail growth, physical presence of the nail plate, and difficulty in finding compounds with adequate pharmacologic profile for nail penetration. Topical treatments such as amorolfine, ciclopirox, and tioconazole have limited efficacy and require strong patient adherence.

3. A recent study has reported the therapeutic efficacy of tazarotene 0.1% gel for the topical treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, with complete healing achieved in all patients after 12 weeks and a rapid and progressive amelioration of all evaluated clinical parameters. Tazarotene has also been shown to have direct fungistatic activity against various fungal species, including Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton verrucosum, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 3}

1. The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of left ventricular (LV) endocardial pacing in patients with heart failure who did not respond to conventional cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The study found that 5 out of 24 patients showed a significant improvement in LV endocardial pacing, with an average increase in LV dp/dtmax of 25.8% compared to 9.6% with the implanted coronary sinus system.

2. The study also found that the position of the LV endocardial lead was crucial for the success of the therapy, with patients who had a posterolateral position of the lead showing a better clinical response compared to those with an apical or anterolateral position.

3. The study demonstrated that acute haemodynamic studies can be useful in predicting clinical outcome, but there were limitations in using cut-off values to differentiate between clinical response and non-response. The study suggested that a substantial further increase in LV dp/dtmax from endocardial pacing at a posterolateral position compared to the apical coronary sinus lead may be a better indicator of clinical response.

4. The study concluded that LV endocardial pacing, guided by acute haemodynamic studies, could improve clinical outcome in patients not responding to conventional CRT, but larger randomized series are necessary to justify this technique before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

2. The disease may not progress to renal failure in half of the patients, but several risk factors such as hypertension, renal hemorrhage, multiple pregnancies, male gender, and PKD1 disease genotype have been associated with a more rapid course.

3. Pregnant subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis are at risk for complications such as maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, infected renal and hepatic cysts, pyelonephritis, and rupture of cerebral artery aneurysm during labor with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

4. However, with careful and effective perioperative monitoring, spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

5. An 80 kg, 35-year-old full-term primigravida with oligohydramnios was scheduled for emergency lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) and was diagnosed with ADPKD in the seventh month of pregnancy.

6. The patient was hospitalized and hemodialyzed thrice a week for the next 2 months to maintain blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and potassium values within acceptable limits.

1. The study analyzed the pattern of milk yield in normal and mastitis crossbred cows using a gamma type function to determine the accuracy of the model in predicting milk yield with minimum error.

2. The data collected from 733 Karan Fries cows over a period of 12 years showed that the fortnightly test-day milk yield increased till the 3rd and 4th fortnights and declined steadily with advancement of lactation.

3. The study found that the peak milk yield was observed in the 4th parity (16.45 kg and 14.42 kg) while the minimum yield was observed in the 1st parity in both normal and mastitis cows (11.28 versus 10.35 kg/d).

4. The lactation curve parameters for fortnightly test-day milk yield exhibited similar trends in normal and mastitis infected cows, with a gradual decline in milk yield till the end of lactation.

5. The study found that higher persistency of lactation was observed in the 1st parity (54.34 and 51.40) which declined till the 5th and above parity in all of the cows.

6. The peak yield was minimum in the 1st parity (13.89 kg/d and 12.58 kg/d) and maximum in the 4th parity (19.67 kg/d and 16.61 kg/d) in normal and mastitis cows, respectively.

7. The coefficient of determination of variation (r) ranged from 84.88% to 98.18% in normal cows and from 83.93% to 97.68% in mastitis cows during different parities.

1. The study investigated the effects of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on the lifespan of mice and Drosophila, and its potential mechanisms of action. Mice were fed NDGA at doses of 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.5 g/kg diet, while Drosophila were exposed to 3.0 mg/ml medium.

2. The results showed that NDGA extended the median lifespan of mice by 12% at a dose of 373 mg/kg body weight per day, but had no effect on maximum lifespan. In contrast, Drosophila lifespan was increased by 23% at a dose of 3.0 mg/ml medium.

3. The study also investigated the effects of NDGA on body weight and food consumption in mice and Drosophila. In mice, NDGA reduced body weight at higher doses, while in Drosophila, it had no effect on body weight or food consumption.

4. The study found that NDGA increased the incidence of liver, lung, and thymus tumors, and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice. However, it had no effect on liver or kidney toxicity as measured by serum chemistries.

5. The study also investigated the potential mechanisms of action of NDGA, including its inhibitory effects on the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). However, the data suggest that reduced mTORC1 activity alone is unlikely to be the major mechanism by which NDGA extends murine lifespan.

6. The study found that NDGA decreased the mass of liver tumors by 24% relative to those found in control mice, suggesting that it decreased the rate of liver tumor growth. However, it increased the prevalence of lung and thymus tumors.

7. The study also investigated the potential role of hormetic stimuli in the longevity effects of NDGA. However, the data suggest that NDGA may produce molecular damage at its optimum dosage for increasing lifespan, rather than stimulating increased maintenance and repair.

8. The study concluded that NDGA has potential as a cancer therapeutic, but its use as a longevity agent is limited by its toxicity and potential to increase tumor formation. Further study is needed to determine the optimal dosage and mechanism of action of NDGA.

2. The driving hope of these major advances in genetic epidemiology is that promotion of personalized medicine will improve medical decision-making, and current personalized medicine applications are far more broad, including situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.

3. Biomarkers are characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention, and they can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction in personalized medicine.

4. Important terms in biomarker studies include cancer biomarkers, clinical endpoints, companion endpoints, copy number variant (CNV) biomarkers, diagnostic biomarkers, disease biomarkers, DNA biomarkers, efficacy biomarkers, epigenetic biomarkers, monitoring biomarkers, prognostic biomarkers, predictive biomarkers, and surrogate biomarkers.

5. DNA biomarkers are generally measured in the blood, tumor DNA biomarkers are measured in tumor tissue, and general biomarkers may be measured in biofluid, tissue, or cell lines, and they have different characteristics, such as stability, reproducibility, and suitability for therapy monitoring.

6. Biomarkers have been identified to predict treatment outcome, and some have proven particularly effective in resolving unconvincing or ambiguous clinical trial results, and regulatory approval is required before a new drug can enter the market.

1. Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton, consisting of a pair of N-terminal motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain.

2. The directed movement of MyoVa is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in processive motion.

3. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs, stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains, and calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of MyoVa.

4. The researchers used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains, anchoring a MyoVa-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor.

5. The researchers expressed various MyoVa constructs, including full-length murine MyoVa, a double-headed short construct, and single-headed MyoVa, and purified them using the baculovirus/SF9 cell system.

6. The researchers used TPM to measure the flexural stiffness of the MyoVa constructs, attaching quantum dots to the MyoVa constructs and actin filaments, and measuring the motion of the quantum dots using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted microscope.

7. The researchers found that the flexural stiffness of the MyoVa constructs increased with increasing tether length, and that the lever arm flexural stiffness was significantly higher than the rod domain flexural stiffness.

8. The researchers also found that the addition of calcium led to a 40% reduction in lever arm flexural stiffness, and that the variance of the qdot motion increased significantly in the presence of calcium.

9. The researchers concluded that the estimates of flexural stiffness for various MyoVa constructs and subdomains by TPM offer direct insight into the structural components of the MyoVa motor that are critical to its functional capacities, and that the potential for alterations in the lever arm stiffness with changes in intracellular calcium may provide a measure of tunability in regulating cargo transport and delivery linked to changes in the cell's ionic environment.

1. The study aimed to determine whether clinical outcomes after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

2. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aurka, erbb2, mdm2, cdh1, cdkn2a, and tp73 genes were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who had undergone surgical resection with curative intent.

3. The study found that patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients carrying the wild-type genotype, while patients with EAC harboring the homozygous cdh1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival.

4. The results suggest that the variant genotypes of SNPs located in the promoter region of the mdm2 and cdh1 genes were significantly associated with DFS in patients with EAC, and that the mdm2 t/g genotype may be associated with improved survival due to its interaction with the tumor TP53 status.

5. The study's findings could contribute to the identification of patients who are at high or low risk for the development of disease recurrences, and may serve as a hypothesis-generating tool for prospective studies evaluating the prognostic significance of germ-line variants.

2. OPC is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients, with over 90% of them developing this infection at some point during the progression of their disease.

3. OPC can appear as erythematous patches or white, scrapable lesions and is often one of the first clinical signs of HIV infection, particularly in patients with CD4+ counts below 200/mm or high viral loads.

4. The study aimed to evaluate the forms of OPC and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients, using a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study design.

5. The study found that Candida species were isolated from the oral cavity in 76% of the 50 consenting participants, with C. albicans being the most frequent species isolated in 92% of the cases.

6. The distribution of oral lesions based on CD4+ count showed that 62% of the oral lesions occurred at CD4+ count < 200 cells/mm, 26% at CD4+ count of 201-499 cells/mm, and 12% at CD4+ count > 500 cells/mm.

7. The majority of patients with OPC had cell counts < 200 cells/mm, followed by those with CD4+ cell counts of 201-499 cells/mm.

8. The study's findings emphasize the need for continued awareness of OPC as a major clinical sign in HIV-positive patients, particularly in those with low CD4+ counts.

2. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with a combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients, but it has drawbacks, including the use of radioisotopes, which are subject to stringent regulations and not accessible to many hospitals worldwide.

3. A magnetic technique using a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) tracer and a handheld magnetometer has been evaluated as a radiation-free alternative to the combined technique, and it was found to be noninferior with identification rates of 94.4-98.0%.

4. A study evaluated the performance of three different-sized SPIO-based formulations (Feraheme/Rienso, Sienna+, and Endorem/Feridex) as magnetic tracers in a porcine model, and the results showed that the 59 nm tracer demonstrated statistically significant higher ex vivo magnetometer counts and iron content compared to the other two tracers.

5. The 59 nm tracer was found to be the most suitable magnetic tracer for SLNB due to its rapid distribution, retention in the first nodes reached, and accumulation in high concentrations, making it the best performing magnetic nanoparticle tracer approved for human use in SLNB with a handheld magnetometer.

2. Vaspin is also expressed in the skin, hypothalamus, pancreatic islets, and stomach, and its levels are inversely associated with T2DM and other metabolic traits.

3. Studies have shown that plasma vaspin concentrations are significantly higher in men with the metabolic syndrome compared to those without, and serum vaspin levels are higher in patients with T2DM than in those with normal glucose tolerance.

4. However, a study found that serum vaspin levels were lower in 169 diabetic patients than in 247 individuals without T2DM, and there was no significant difference in serum vaspin levels between patients with renal insufficiency (RI) and those without RI.

5. The study also found that serum adiponectin levels were higher in non-diabetic individuals with RI than in those without RI, and there was no significant difference in serum adiponectin levels between diabetic patients with RI and those without RI.

6. The study used a total of 416 subjects, divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of RI and T2DM, and measured various clinical parameters, including serum vaspin and adiponectin levels.

7. The results showed that serum vaspin levels were related to creatinine (CR) in patients without T2DM, and to age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and uric acid (UA) in patients with T2DM.

8. Serum adiponectin levels were related to age, SBP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), CR, and bun in subjects without T2DM, and to fasting blood glucose (FBG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with T2DM.

2. The trials involved patients with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs, who were randomized to receive intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) at 25 or 75 μg, or a placebo.

3. The main efficacy variable was granulation tissue development, and the median time to complete closure was 15 weeks, with 25th and 75th percentiles of 9.6 and 21.4 weeks, respectively.

4. The study also included an active postmarketing surveillance of rhEGF treatment in 1,440 DFUs from 60 healthcare units, which confirmed the results of the clinical trials.

5. The surrogate markers of complete healing generated in the study included percent change in area, log healing rate, ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT), and granulation tissue development.

6. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.

7. The study found that granulation tissue development at the EOT was an early predictor of final healing, with a 72.9% certainty and positive/negative predictive values of 71.7/75.8%, respectively.

8. The proportion-mediated for granulation variables at 2 weeks and EOT was very high, suggesting that granulation constitutes an essential part of the healing process, particularly in larger and advanced ulcers.

9. The study also found that the effect of treatment on healing was not necessarily mediated by an area reduction in the earlier weeks, and that the granulation process showed good capacity to discriminate healers from non-healers.

10. The results of the study suggest that granulation tissue development can be used as a surrogate marker for complete wound closure in advanced DFUs, and that it may be useful for clinical trial design and healthcare programs managing diabetic foot ulcers.

1. The study compared the perioperative extent of surgical trauma and its postoperative impact on the abdominal wall after needlescopic transabdominal preperitoneal (ntapp) and single-incision laparoscopic (stapp) repair for inguinal hernia. The results showed that the ntapp procedure had a significantly smaller umbilical skin incision length and required less operating time compared to the stapp procedure.

2. The study found that the ntapp procedure resulted in reduced immediate postoperative pain in the wound region, with a mean pain duration of 5.6 days compared to 9.8 days in the stapp group. Additionally, the ntapp group had a significantly shorter mean period of sick leave, with a mean of 11.2 days compared to 24.1 days in the stapp group.

3. Despite the advantages of the ntapp procedure in the immediate postoperative phase, both groups achieved similar results in terms of hernia recurrence, abdominal wall mobility, and cosmetic satisfaction after a mean follow-up time of 33.5 months for the ntapp group and 30.1 months for the stapp group.

4. The study concluded that the ntapp procedure with smaller caliber trocars can further minimize surgical trauma to the abdominal wall tissue and requires significantly less operating time than the stapp procedure. However, randomized controlled trials are still needed to validate the benefits of needlescopic surgery in comparison to conventional tapp repairs.

The study aimed to establish a correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, which is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in children. The results showed a regular and positive correlation between the two exams, but cephalometry tended to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsil compared to nasopharyngoscopy.

2. Nasopharyngoscopy was considered the gold standard exam for assessing the nasopharynx due to its dynamic and tridimensional view, which allows for a more accurate assessment of the pharyngeal tonsil size and its relation to other structures in the region. Cephalometry, on the other hand, was found to have a sensitivity of 35% and a negative predictive value of 72% in diagnosing hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils.

3. The study suggested that patients presenting with mouth-breathing symptoms and normal radiography should be referred for a complementary assessment with nasopharyngoscopy, which is associated with greater diagnostic accuracy due to its tridimensional and dynamic nature. Cephalometry can be used as a complementary exam to provide information about craniofacial growth and document and monitor the complex morphofunctional modifications related to mouth breathing.

4. The findings of the study highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and treatment of mouth-breathing patients, including otorhinolaryngologists, phonoaudiologists, odontologists, and physiotherapists.

The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in patients previously treated for breast carcinoma is estimated to be less than 6%, but distinguishing between true local recurrence (TR) and new primary tumor (NPT) is crucial due to different clinical relevance, prognosis, and therapeutic management. To differentiate between TR and NPT, factors such as location, staging, and histological subtype are considered.

2. A 35-year-old premenopausal woman with a history of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in her right breast underwent breast-conserving surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Four years later, she developed a new IDC in the same breast, which was diagnosed as inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). She received treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab, and underwent breast reconstruction surgery.

3. The risk of developing a second breast cancer among women diagnosed with a first breast cancer is similar to the risk of developing a first breast cancer in the general population. However, the risk of a second breast cancer depends on estrogen receptor (ER) status, period of diagnosis, and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Patients with NPT generally have a favorable prognosis, while those with TR have a poor prognosis and may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant treatment.",1,{'n_points': 3}

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in developed countries, with the neovascular form accounting for the majority of cases of AMD-related severe central vision loss. The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed with the development of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, which is significantly more effective in preventing progressive vision loss than previous alternative treatment modalities.

2. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept in patients with treatment-resistant neovascular AMD, with a focus on contrast sensitivity (CS) as a primary outcome measure. The study included 40 patients who received 3 consecutive monthly aflibercept injections followed by an injection every 2 months for 12 months.

3. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in CS from baseline to week 12, with an average CS change of two letters, which is broadly comparable to a five-letter difference in visual acuity (VA) in terms of vision function performance. The study also found a statistically significant decrease in central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to week 12, with no meaningful change from baseline VA observed.

4. The study suggests that CS measurement may provide a more complete understanding of the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment on vision-related functional performance in patients with neovascular AMD, and that measurement of CS could provide useful early information on visual impairment not identifiable on VA assessment alone. The study's findings support the argument that CS should be considered as a valuable additional outcome endpoint in future clinical studies of neovascular AMD, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion.</summary>",1,{'n_points': 4}

1. The study aimed to evaluate the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and multiple sclerosis (MS) in an Iranian population. The researchers hypothesized that this polymorphism may be associated with MS, given its potential role in regulating immune responses during inflammatory diseases.

2. The study included 74 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 75 healthy controls, who were matched in terms of age and sex. The researchers collected blood samples from the participants and analyzed the IL-25 gene using PCR amplification and RFLP.

3. The results showed that neither the aa, ac, and cc genotypes nor the a and c alleles were associated with MS in the Iranian population. The logistic regression model also found that the odds ratio of MS development in patients with the ac and aa genotypes compared to patients with the cc genotype was not statistically significant.

4. The study's findings suggest that the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene may not be an important factor in the pathogenesis of MS, and that other polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene may play a more significant role in regulating IL-25 expression and MS development.

1. The study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a population of elderly Korean males with hypertension, using non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans.

2. The study found that the prevalence of TAA was 36.5% and AAA was 6.0%, with 16 patients (3.2%) having both conditions simultaneously.

3. The study identified several risk factors associated with TAA, including age, absence of dyslipidemia, body surface area, diastolic blood pressure, and presence of AAA.

4. In contrast, AAA was independently associated with presence of dyslipidemia, current/past smoking, and presence of TAA.

5. The study also found that TAA was more prevalent in patients with AAA compared to those without AAA, and that TAA prevalence continuously increases with age and hypertension.

6. The study suggests that the etiology of aortic aneurysms may differ between ascending and descending aorta, with non-atherosclerotic disease being more prevalent in the ascending aorta, and that further studies are needed to clarify the relationship among TAA, AAA, dyslipidemia, serum cholesterol, and statin therapy.

1. Endometrial cancer has become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries, surpassing cervical cancer in morbidity. 
2. The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Sap-1 device in obtaining endometrial samples for cytological analysis and to compare its adequacy with traditional methods such as D&C and hysteroscopic biopsy.
3. The Sap-1 device is a direct endometrial sampler that is designed to be minimally invasive, cost-effective, and user-friendly, making it suitable for mass screening programs.
4. The study found that the Sap-1 device provided more adequate specimens for cytology (96.3%) compared to D&C (76%) and hysteroscopic biopsy, with no significant difference in specimen adequacy between the Sap-1 device and D&C in premenopausal women.
5. The study also found that the Sap-1 device combined with the liquid-based SurePath preparation method had an overall accuracy of 92.4% for detecting endometrial cancer, complex hyperplasia with atypia, and EIN, with a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 95.8%, PPV of 75%, and NPV of 95.3%.
6. The study suggests that the Sap-1 device combined with SurePath preparation may become a reliable method for screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor, especially in postmenopausal and asymptomatic women, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary D&C procedures and enabling early detection and management of asymptomatic women with precursors.

1. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a mammography-based technique that uses low-dose X-rays to create detailed 3D images of the breast, which can help improve cancer detection and reduce false positives. Studies have shown that adding DBT to standard mammography can increase cancer detection rates by 34-40% and reduce recall rates by 17-40%.

2. DBT has several advantages over conventional mammography, including improved image quality, reduced radiation dose, and increased patient comfort. However, it also has some limitations, such as increased radiation exposure when combined with conventional mammography, and longer interpretation times for radiologists.

3. Researchers are continuing to develop and refine DBT technology, including the use of contrast-enhanced tomosynthesis, which can provide more detailed information about tumor neovascularity and potentially improve cancer detection rates. Additionally, DBT is being combined with other imaging modalities, such as automated breast ultrasound, to improve detection rates in dense breasts.

1. Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications have been criticized for lacking evidence supporting their efficacy, particularly as antitussives (cough suppressants).

2. Diphenhydramine, a commonly used first-generation antihistamine, is classified as an antitussive by the FDA and has been shown to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in healthy volunteers and diminish pathological chronic cough.

3. Despite billions of dollars spent annually on OTC cough preparations, there is scant evidence supporting the efficacy of these drugs as antitussives, with most studies being decades old and lacking robust objective and subjective end points.

4. A recent study used capsaicin cough challenge testing to evaluate the effect of diphenhydramine-containing, multicomponent syrup compared to dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo on cough reflex sensitivity in healthy subjects with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI).

5. The study found that diphenhydramine significantly inhibited cough reflex sensitivity, with a significant increase in mean log c5 values compared to placebo, while dextromethorphan did not show a significant difference.

6. The diphenhydramine-containing syrup, which also contained the decongestant phenylephrine and natural cocoa flavoring, was found to be a more effective antitussive than dextromethorphan, administered at standard antitussive doses.

7. The study's findings contribute to the initial evidence demonstrating the ability of diphenhydramine to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in acute pathological cough, highlighting the need for further clinical trials to adequately evaluate OTC cough and cold products.

1. The global population, especially those in developed countries, is getting older, and this trend is predicted to continue in the coming decades, leading to an increase in cardiovascular diseases.

2. Aging is associated with a decreased ability to resist cellular stresses or insults, and it is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors for predisposing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

3. The endothelium plays a crucial role in adjusting vascular function by producing nitric oxide (NO) and other biologically active vasodilator materials, but alterations in its control can lead to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and other vascular disorders.

4. Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between the production of oxidizing agents and opposing antioxidant systems, is a critical mechanism for endothelial dysfunction, particularly in older subjects, and it can be alleviated by exercise training.

5. Exercise training can restore age-related impairment of endothelial function by restoring NO availability, preventing oxidative stress, and alleviating inflammatory processes, and it can also increase the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and Nrf2.

6. Regular exercise can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, increasing anti-inflammatory substances such as IL-10, and enhancing lipid turnover and fat oxidation via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase.

1. The axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and prognosis worsens with increasing number of metastatic lymph nodes.

2. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International Union Against Cancer (UICC) tumor (T)-node (N)-metastasis (M) classification classifies nodal disease into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes: N1, 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes; N2, 4-9 metastatic lymph nodes; and N3, 10 or more metastatic lymph nodes.

3. Studies have shown that the number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of removed lymph nodes, and the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes to removed lymph nodes, known as the lymph node ratio (LNR), provides more useful prognostic information.

4. The LNR threshold value separating patients into two prognostic groups with significantly different survival rates varies in different studies, but a threshold value of 0.20-0.25 is commonly cited.

5. A study of 924 patients with breast carcinoma and 1-3 axillary metastatic lymph nodes found that the LNR threshold value of 0.20 separated patients into two prognostic groups with significantly different disease-free survival (DFS) rates, and the LNR had independent prognostic significance.

6. The study also found that the number of removed lymph nodes was not significantly related to DFS or locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rates, but the LNR was a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes.

7. The study suggests that the LNR can be used to standardize adjuvant therapy for patients operated in hospitals with different axillary dissection widths and median numbers of removed lymph nodes, and to draw reliable comparisons between treatment results from different hospitals.

1. Researchers have identified three acid phosphatases, phonsf, phonse, and piacp, as efficient catalysts for the phosphorylation of various alcohols, including primary and secondary mono and dihydroxy compounds, with absolute chemoselectivity for o vs. n and snucleophiles and high regioselectivity for prim over sec hydroxy groups.

2. The use of these phosphatases in synthetic applications requires careful control of reaction parameters, such as pH, donor concentrations, and incubation time, to minimize thermodynamically favored hydrolysis of phosphate esters and achieve high product yields. Immobilization of the enzymes on polymeric beads has also been demonstrated to be an efficient tool for scale-up and maintaining high product levels.

1. The phenomenon of non-native biological invasions has been observed for centuries, with notable examples including the phylloxera that devastated the European wine industry in the 1860s and the chestnut blight that eliminated a dominant tree species in North America.

2. Despite early warnings, it wasn't until the 1980s that a surge of research on invasions was triggered by an international project of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), which recognized invasions as one of the great ongoing global environmental changes.

3. Recent research has revealed that the impacts of introduced species are more varied and widespread than previously thought, with two new lines of research emerging: ecosystem-level impacts, such as changes to nutrient cycles and ecosystem processes, and genetic and evolutionary impacts, including hybridization and introgression with native species.

4. Critics of invasion biology have raised several objections, including that the problems caused by invasions are overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, and that the methods used to combat invasive species are inhumane. However, most of these criticisms are based on incomplete or inaccurate information.

5. Despite these criticisms, modern invasion biology has made significant progress in understanding the impacts of introduced species and developing effective management strategies, including risk assessment tools, biosecurity measures, and eradication techniques.

6. The field of restoration ecology is also being undermined by critics who advocate for the acceptance of ""novel ecosystems"" as a new normal, despite the fact that this concept is undefined and lacks operational criteria. Restoration ecology aims to re-establish the historical trajectory of an ecosystem before anthropogenic influences derailed it, and there is no evidence that any particular ecosystem cannot be restored.

1. Schwannomas are rare tumors of the nerve sheath that arise from the primary glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, and although benign and slow-growing, they can cause significant morbidity due to direct involvement of nerves or by local mass effect.

2. Approximately 25 to 45% of all schwannomas are found in the head and neck, where they can originate from virtually any cranial nerve, with the most common being the vestibular schwannoma.

3. The vestibular schwannoma accounts for 51% of all nerve sheath tumors found anywhere in the body and arises from the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve.

4. Schwannomas of the vidian canal are extremely rare, with only four documented cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas reported in the literature.

5. The vidian nerve arises from the joining of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve, with the greater superficial petrosal nerve consisting of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve.

6. The parasympathetic fibers of the vidian nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, whereas the sympathetic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland and secretory pathways of the nasopalatine glands.

7. Damage to the vidian nerve itself can result in decreased or absent lacrimation, corneal desiccation, and dryness of the nasal mucosa, as well as cluster headaches.

8. A case of biopsy-proven schwannoma of the vidian canal is presented, where the patient was a 49-year-old woman with a 24-year history of multiple sclerosis who presented for follow-up evaluation after an acute flare of MS.

9. The patient underwent radiation therapy with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) due to the benign histology, background of MS, and young age, which minimized the risk of late normal tissue injury.

10. Radiation therapy has become a common alternative to surgical resection of intracranial schwannomas, with options including single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or conventional daily low-dose fractionation over approximately five weeks, and has been reported to result in decreased mortality and fewer treatment-related complications.

The results showed that the addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the construct, regardless of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used.

2. The study found that the short-segment fixation with monoaxial pedicle screws (mps) was significantly more stable in flexion and extension than the short-segment fixation with polyaxial pedicle screws (pps). However, the addition of intermediate screws at the level of the burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation in both mps and pps groups.

3. The study suggests that the use of intermediate screws at the level of fractured vertebrae with posterior short-segment fixation, especially when using monoaxial screws, can provide a biomechanical rationale for managing unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region. However, the limitations of the study include the use of a calf spine model and the lack of comparison with long-segment fixations and application of the cross-link.

1. Researchers have developed a method for obtaining highly porous and crystallized p-cuscn thin films by electrodeposition, which can be used as a dye-sensitized photocathode. The method involves loading rhodamine B (rb) molecules into the film, which can occupy up to 30% of the total volume of the precipitated solid, and then removing them by soaking the film in dimethylacetamide (dma).

2. The resulting porous crystalline cuscn thin film has been used to prove its usefulness as a dye-sensitized photocathode, but challenges remain, including limited surface area and the lack of a good hole-injecting dye stable on the cuscn surface and a suitable redox electrolyte. However, recent studies have discovered a good sensitizer for p-nio, offering hope for finding one for p-cuscn, which could lead to the development of high-efficiency tandem dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, specifically the pharyngeal endoderm, and is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx.

2. A tornwaldt's cyst develops if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, while crusts adhering to the orifice without obstruction form the crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis.

3. The crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is characterized by the periodic shedding of crusts from the nasopharynx, causing an offensive smell and unpleasant taste.

4. The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is more common and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal abscesses and cysts.

5. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal bursitis can include space-occupying lesions such as nasal obstruction, Eustachian tube obstruction, and cranial nerve paralysis, as well as rhinitis symptoms like choanal discharge and halitosis.

6. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 15 and 30 years and a Caucasian predominance.

7. A clinicoanatomical audit of nasopharyngeal bursitis at a rhinology practice in a university unit during 2008-2009 found six patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis, with an equal incidence of the cystic and crust types.

8. The classical cyst type of nasopharyngeal bursitis presented with postnasal discharge, throat irritation, and cough, while the fibrosed type was discovered incidentally in a patient with snoring.

9. The crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis presented with crust expectoration, retching, and/or fetid postnasal discharge, and occasional occipital pain, with symptom-free intervals in between.

2. Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with over 1,890 new cases diagnosed daily.

3. Early diagnosis of melanoma is crucial for prognosis, and dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables the visualization of morphological features not discernible by the naked eye.

4. Dermoscopy has been shown to improve diagnostic sensitivity by 10-30% compared to unaided eye examination, but may lower diagnostic accuracy in inexperienced hands.

5. The diagnosis of melanoma is highly dependent on subjective judgment and is scarcely reproducible, making it challenging to develop accurate diagnostic algorithms.

6. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve diagnostic performance, including the ABCD-E rule, the seven-point checklist, and the Menzies method.

7. Despite these efforts, the within- and between-observer concordance is low, even for expert observers, highlighting the need for more accurate and reliable diagnostic methods.

8. Automated analysis of digitized images obtained by dermoscopy techniques has gained interest in recent years, with the aim of assisting clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions.

9. Machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and artificial neural networks, have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.

2. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the number of people with diabetes worldwide is expected to rise from 366 million in 2010 to 552 million by 2030 if no action is taken.

3. Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2D, which is often the result of a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.

4. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC-1) gene is a multifunctional regulatory factor involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and insulin secretion, and has been associated with T2D in different populations.

5. The estrogen-related receptor-alpha (ESRRA) gene is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, and has been hypothesized to be a candidate gene involved in the pathogenesis of T2D.

6. The mitofusin 2 (MFN2) gene is a mitochondrial fusion protein that regulates mitochondrial morphology and distribution, and has been shown to play a role in oxidative metabolism and ER-mitochondria juxtaposition.

7. A study of 1204 unrelated subjects, including 555 patients with T2D and 649 nondiabetic control subjects, found that the A allele and C allele frequencies of rs873458 and rs2878677 of the MFN2 gene in the diabetic group were lower than in the control group, suggesting that these alleles confer protection against T2D.

8. The study also found that the genotype distributions of rs873458 and rs2878677 of the MFN2 gene were significantly different in case-control subjects, and that the C allele of rs2878677 of the MFN2 gene was associated with a lower risk of T2D.

9. The study identified interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1 genes, and suggested that these genes may serve as partial or additive factors leading to T2D.

2. The study found that carriers of cyp2c19 * 2 alleles had higher platelet aggregation and higher VN-P2Y12 reactivity with significantly lower VN platelet inhibition than non-carriers.

3. In contrast, pon1 (q192r) polymorphism was not associated with increased platelet aggregation or reduced platelet inhibition in the study population.

4. The study also found that pon1 (q192r) polymorphism was not associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis, contradicting previous findings by Bouman et al.

5. The results of the current study are consistent with findings of Shuldiner et al, who did not demonstrate an association of SNPs in or near the pon1 gene with clopidogrel nonresponse during clopidogrel maintenance dosing.

6. The study confirms the previously reported impact of reduced-function cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphism on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, which has been demonstrated to be a strong determinant of reduced active clopidogrel metabolite formation and increased on-treatment ADP-induced platelet reactivity.

3. Seizures are a common presenting symptom in patients with congenital toxoplasmosis, and many patients require anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) to manage their seizures.

4. A case report describes a 34-year-old woman with congenital toxoplasmosis who presented with medically intractable seizures, which were resistant to multiple AEDs.

5. The patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET) scans, which revealed a calcified nodule in the left perihippocampal area and hippocampal sclerosis (HS).

6. The patient's seizures were characterized by a psychic aura, followed by a dialeptic seizure, and were accompanied by tonic posturing and head version.

7. The patient underwent left anteromesial temporal resection, including the calcified lesion, which resulted in seizure control.

8. The case highlights the association between congenital toxoplasmosis and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), which is often medically intractable and may be related to hippocampal damage.

2. The study included 242 children aged 0.9 to 16.4 years, followed up from diagnosis to adulthood. PR occurred in 56.2% of patients, with no complete remission observed. The proportion of girls and boys was comparable among remitters and nonremitters.

3. The absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was significantly higher in PR patients (82.3%) than in non-PR patients (63.5%), and this effect was more pronounced in boys. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that chances of PR were higher when there was no DKA at diagnosis.

4. Lower A1c levels at diagnosis were associated with higher chances of PR, and this effect was more pronounced in girls. A1c levels at 3 months after diagnosis were strongly associated with PR duration, with low A1cs (≤ 6%) associated with longer PR durations.

5. Higher baseline C-peptide concentrations were observed in PR patients compared to non-PR patients, and this effect was more pronounced in boys. However, initial C-peptide levels were not significantly associated with higher chances of PR, and the age effect in C-peptide levels observed in the study might be explained by differences in treatment modalities.

2. Chondroblastoma localized in the head and neck region is uncommon but characteristically occurs in the temporal bone or the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and results in various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea.

3. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma, although rare, have been observed after irradiation, and radiation therapy should not be considered to avoid the inherent risk of malignant progression.

4. Chondroblastoma in the temporal bone has unusual histological features that make diagnosis difficult, and incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence.

5. A 41-year-old male patient was initially misdiagnosed with otitis media and underwent several attempts at antibiotic therapy and treatment for eustachian tube blockage, but his symptoms were unresponsive to both systemic antibiotic agents and tubing therapy.

6. The patient was later diagnosed with a giant cell tumor in the temporal bone after a CT scan and pathologic examination, but further examination revealed a tumor mass that had progressively enlarged and widely destroyed the middle cranial fossa in the temporal lobe.

7. The tumor was found to be a chondroblastoma, and a generous C-shaped postauricular incision was made to expose the underlying fascia, periosteum, and muscle, followed by a subtotal resection of the temporal bone and skull base dissection.

8. The patient underwent reconstruction of the facial tissue by inserting the sternocleidomastoid muscle flap into the infratemporal fossa, and four and a half years after surgery, enhanced CT imaging showed no residual tumor.

9. The patient did not undergo postoperative irradiation since it is contraindicated with a diagnosis of chondroblastoma, and the study underlines the importance of an accurate diagnosis, especially for a mass in the temporal bone, to prevent malignant transformation and recurrence.

A study aimed to evaluate the relationship between objectively measured sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity with levels of visceral adiposity (vat) and liver fat (ihl) in adults with overweight/obesity. The results showed no association between sedentary behavior and levels of ihl or vat, and low levels of objectively measured physical activity did not predict high levels of vat or ihl.

2. The findings suggest that while traditional risk factors such as waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin may predict the incidence of nafld or high levels of vat, objectively quantified physical activity levels and sedentary behavior did not predict those at risk. This study's results are counterintuitive to epidemiological data, which suggests that physical inactivity is associated with the development of nafld and visceral adiposity, and reducing sedentary behavior should be advocated in all populations.

2. The study found that the severity of ocular damage was more among patients who ignited the fireworks themselves than bystanders. The most common types of firecracker causing injury were bombs, and high-velocity fireworks such as rockets and bombs were associated with facial lacerations, intraocular foreign bodies, endophthalmitis, and poorer visual outcomes.

3. The study reported a significant percentage of patients losing their vision due to firework-related eye injuries, with 5 eyes developing phthisis bulbi and 7 eyes having vision worse than 3/60. The most common findings involving the anterior segment were corneal abrasions, corneal foreign body, and hyphema, while the most common posterior segment finding was vitreous hemorrhage.

4. The study highlights the need for immediate measures such as prohibiting the manufacture and sale of dangerous fireworks, public awareness about the possible dangers, and expert primary ophthalmic care of the injured to reduce significant ocular morbidity and noise pollution. A combined approach of creating public awareness and strong legislation is required to regulate the manufacture, sale, and use of consumer fireworks to reduce this preventable cause of ocular morbidity.

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (sch), characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, is a relatively common disorder that represents early, mild thyroid failure.

2. The prevalence of sch varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement, and it is necessary to standardize the normal reference range for TSH levels and establish quality control procedures.

3. Studies have shown that sch is associated with various adverse clinical effects, including increased body weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels, as well as impaired cardiac function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality.

4. The treatment of sch is considered only for patients who are pregnant, infertile, exhibit associated symptoms, or have a high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, and the evidence supporting screening for this disorder and the benefits and risks of its treatment remains controversial.

5. A multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial, the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) study, is currently underway to assess the multimodal effects of thyroid hormone replacement in adults 65 years of age and older with persistent sch and to clarify the populations that may benefit from T4 replacement therapy.

1. The anaerobic gram-positive bacillus Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and its toxins A and B induce Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

2. Although CDAD is a common healthcare-associated infectious disease, treatment or infection countermeasures are not applied to patients who do not present with diarrhea, including asymptomatic adults who carry C. difficile in their intestines.

3. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit is widely used for CDAD diagnosis, but its detection sensitivity for CD toxins is low, typically around 70%, and has been reported to be as low as 50% or below.

4. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has a higher detection sensitivity of around 90% compared to EIA, but it detects the presence of bacteria with toxin genes rather than toxin protein production.

5. A study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and found that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates had milder symptoms and shorter diarrhea duration compared to those with toxin-positive stool specimens.

6. The study also found that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates did not receive CDAD treatment, and their diarrhea duration did not differ significantly from that in the dual-negative group.

7. The sensitivity of EIA for toxin detection is far inferior to that of PCR, but EIA has a high positive predictive value, making it an important test in determining treatment approach.

8. The study's limitations include its retrospective nature, small sample size, and absence of molecular biological testing, which may have affected the results.

9. The findings suggest that patients with gdh-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens may not require CDAD treatment, as their diarrhea duration is shorter compared to those with toxin-positive stool specimens, even without treatment.

1. The Dream Trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

2. The trial included 5,269 participants with IFG, IGT, or both, who were randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization.

3. The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up, which was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.

4. The results showed that rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI/IR and reduced PI/C by 86% and 42%, respectively, in people with IFG and/or IGT, while ramipril did not have significant effects on -cell function.

5. The improvement in -cell function with rosiglitazone was consistent across glucose tolerance subgroups, although there was a suggestion of a more modest effect in the subgroup with isolated IFG.

6. The effect of rosiglitazone on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline -cell function, suggesting that some but not all of the effect of rosiglitazone on diabetes prevention/delay is mediated through its effects on -cell function.

7. The study's findings suggest that rosiglitazone may improve -cell function indirectly by ameliorating pathogenic processes such as lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, and inflammation, and that its glucose-lowering effect may reduce the impact of reactive oxygen species on the -cells.

1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in terms of the toxins they degrade, the natural products they produce, and their capacity to grow in certain environments. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism must extend from the properties of individual strains in pure culture to the combinatorial interactions supported by complex communities.

2. Strains may exhibit naturally complementary metabolism or be genetically engineered to interact, sharing metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose.

3. A general model of metabolic interaction would account for the variety of metabolites that can be exchanged and the genotypic diversity of the strains that exchange them. Ideally, such a model would not require detailed biochemical characterization of each individual participant to be predictive.

4. Optimization-based techniques of flux balance analysis have been successful in describing metabolic systems, drawing on the well-characterized biochemical reaction network of organisms such as Escherichia coli.

5. The study selected 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli from the Keio collection and found that certain pairs of auxotrophs will complement each other's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites, a relationship referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMT).

6. The study developed a quantitative and predictive theoretical model that reveals the extent to which complex metabolic interactions emerge from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network.

7. The study found that the efficiency of cooperation for a strain, defined as the ratio of benefit to cost, is a strong predictor of growth, and that this efficiency term is positively correlated with the growth of the strain.

8. The study's results suggest that the complex emergent phenotype of SMT growth is governed by the relatively simple stoichiometries of the metabolic reaction network, and that metabolic network stoichiometries can be applied to infer biochemical reaction rates through the method of flux balance analysis (FBA).

1. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, mainly trichoepiteliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas.

2. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene cyld (cylindromatosis gene) on chromosome 16q12q13, with around 93 different mutations identified.

3. The study of the cyld gene in patients and their relatives can provide molecular diagnosis and appropriate genetic counseling.

4. A 71-year-old woman was evaluated due to progressive development of asymptomatic lesions in her head over the last 4 years, which were diagnosed as spiradenomas and cylindromas through excisional biopsies.

5. The patient's family history revealed the presence of similar lesions in her mother, maternal uncle, and two of her three daughters, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

6. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation c.1628_1629delct in the cyld gene, which was also found in her two affected daughters but not in an unaffected daughter or her children.

7. The mutation is a two-base pair deletion that originates a new frameshift, leading to a stop codon and potentially contributing to tumorigenesis.

8. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors, with clinical manifestations starting since puberty and a higher incidence in females.

9. The syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of salivary gland neoplasms and other tumors, although evidence is limited, and malignant spiradenoma is a rare but aggressive neoplasm with a high risk of metastasis.

1. Biological scaffold materials derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been utilized for soft tissue repair applications such as hernia repair, breast reconstruction, and orthopedic applications. These materials are particularly useful in clean-contaminated or contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria.

2. Recent absorbable scaffold designs have been developed, which utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly. Examples of these materials include Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, which have been evaluated in various animal studies and clinical trials for their mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics.

3. The current study evaluated the mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics of Phasix Mesh and P4HB Plug designs when utilized to bridge a surgical defect in the porcine abdominal wall over a period of 6, 12, 26, or 52 weeks. The results showed that both devices provided durable scaffolds for soft tissue repair, with significant mechanical strength compared to native abdominal wall over a 52-week period, and a comparable and mild inflammatory response and mild to moderate granulation tissue/vascularization associated with the P4HB material.

1. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci was first detected over 25 years ago and has since become a significant nosocomial pathogen associated with high mortality and costs.

2. The resistance is mediated by van genes, with vana and vanb being the most prevalent, and several European countries have reported a rising incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in recent years.

3. A study in Denmark found a dramatic increase in VRE since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks of vana-positive Enterococcus faecium, and it is estimated that for every patient with a VRE infection detected, up to ten patients are intestinal carriers.

4. Current guidelines recommend screening patients at risk and implementing isolation precautions for VRE carriers, which relies on selective culturing and/or detection of the resistance genes vana or vanb by PCR.

5. A study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert vanA/vanB assay, a fully automated system integrating DNA extraction and real-time PCR, which provides results within an hour and is used to guide rapid implementation of infection control measures.

6. The study found that the sensitivity of the vana PCR assay was 87.1%, the specificity was 99.7%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 98.0% and 97.7%, respectively, making it an excellent diagnostic tool.

7. However, the specificity and positive predictive value of the vanb part of the assay were low, at 77.6% and 0.4%, respectively, which may be due to the presence of vanb-positive anaerobic bacteria.

8. The study also found that the Xpert vanA/vanB assay had a significant impact on infection control decision-making, saving 141 isolation days and 292 transmission risk days as a result of 1110 PCR analyses.

9. The study concluded that the Xpert vanA/vanB assay had a high diagnostic accuracy and considerable impact on infection control decision-making in their setting, and that the costs of the assay were worth the benefits, especially considering the psychosocial consequences of a VRE outbreak situation and isolation precautions for patients and staff members.

1. The study aimed to investigate the effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on ischemia-reperfusion injury in normal and diabetic hearts. The researchers used a combination of RAAS blockers, including an aldosterone antagonist (RU28318), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), and an angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan), to determine the optimal treatment strategy.

2. The study found that treatment with RU28318 was generally more effective in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts compared to treatment with captopril or losartan alone. In diabetic hearts, RU28318 was similarly effective as captopril or losartan treatment.

3. The researchers also found that combination therapies, particularly triple therapy with captopril, losartan, and RU28318, were generally more effective than single therapies in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in both normal and diabetic hearts.

4. The study suggests that MR antagonists, such as RU28318, may represent a novel class of RAAS inhibitors that could overcome the limitations observed with ACEI and ARB combinations. The researchers propose that MR antagonists could be used as a preventative measure in cardiac I/R injury for susceptible patients and possibly also preoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgeries.

1. Modern nasal surgery aims to improve both the cosmetic appearance and natural functions of the nose, and objective measurement of airway patency is crucial in modern respiratory medicine.

2. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry, which has been proven to have a close correlation with the area found by calculations using data from rhinomanometry.

3. The study used AR to evaluate the changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers who underwent cosmetic rhinoplasty, comparing differences in length, minimal cross-sectional area (MCA), and volume of each nasal cavity before and after surgery.

4. The results showed that bilateral D1 and both MCA2 decreased significantly, while significant increase was observed in MCA1 postoperatively, especially in the group with septoplasty.

5. The study found that cases with septoplasty experienced more increase in MCA1 and less constriction in MCA2, and that double osteotomy positively affected nose function by more increase in MCA1.

6. Placing a columellar strut was beneficial for patients, especially in the group with septoplasty, and was associated with significant effects on MCA1 and MCA2 levels.

7. The study concluded that even in cases with mild septal deviation, performing septoplasty may increase patient nose patency, and that double osteotomy and placing a strut may be beneficial for patients.

8. The findings suggest that surgeons should be aware of common patterns of change in nose geometry and take care in interventions in the region of the second constriction to maintain nasal patency.

1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths, and its incidence is still increasing. Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of CVD risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.

2. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health, including lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and anti-atherosclerotic effects. The lipid-lowering action of n-3 PUFAs was detected at the beginning, and these nutrients were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.

3. The beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been demonstrated in several clinical trials, including the GISSI-Prevenzione trial and the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS) trial. These studies have shown that supplementation with n-3 PUFAs can lower the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and reduce the risk of fatal cardiovascular events.

4. The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs exert their beneficial effects on cardiovascular health are complex and multifaceted, involving the modulation of inflammation, endothelial function, and eicosanoid production. N-3 PUFAs may also compete with n-6 fatty acids for cyclooxygenase enzymes, leading to a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and an increase in the production of anti-inflammatory mediators.

1. The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is built on the work of three pioneering pathologists: Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren. 
2. Rudolf Virchow proposed that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation, which is now appreciated in various inflammation-induced cancers, including gastric cancer.
3. Pelayo Correa developed a model for gastric cancer development, which hypothesized that the development of intestinal-type gastric cancer results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years.
4. Initially, Correa thought that environmental factors, such as diet, were responsible for promoting the progression from gastritis to cancer, but later research focused on the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer.
5. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, and their work laid the foundation for understanding the relationship between H. pylori and gastric cancer.
6. Early epidemiologic studies provided weak evidence for a link between H. pylori and gastric cancer, but subsequent research, including cohort studies and meta-analyses, confirmed the association and established H. pylori as a definite carcinogen.
7. H. pylori eradication has been shown to reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer by approximately 40% in primary prevention and by 54% as a tertiary prevention strategy, and vaccination against H. pylori may be a viable alternative to antibiotic treatment.
8. The relationship between H. pylori and gastric cancer is complex, and the absence of H. pylori may promote more severe esophageal mucosal damage and the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, highlighting the need for individualized approaches to H. pylori eradication and gastric cancer prevention.

The results showed that both treatments led to significant improvements in visual acuity and central retinal thickness (CRT) compared to baseline, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups.

2. The study found that 86.1% of patients in the bevacizumab group and 86.5% of patients in the ranibizumab group had stable or improved visual acuity after a mean follow-up time of approximately 18 months. The visual and anatomical outcomes, as well as the number of injections, were similar between the two groups.

3. The study's findings are consistent with previous clinical studies that have reported similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes with bevacizumab and ranibizumab treatments.

1. Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, complicating 25% of all pregnancies, and is often associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

2. However, several studies have shown that proteinuria is not a significant predictor of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and the incidence of PE has increased in China since the implementation of the two-child policy.

3. Severe PE is often combined with hypoalbuminemia, which may serve as an indicator of the severity of PE, and hypoalbuminemia occurs mainly due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged vascular endothelial cells.

4. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with PE, according to the different value of albumin (25 g/L and <25 g/L), and the results showed that severe hypoproteinemia (SHP) was a significant risk factor for cesarean section, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes.

5. Women with SHP were delivered almost 1.5 weeks earlier than the mild hypoproteinemia (MHP) group, and had a higher percentage of cesarean sections, severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta.

6. Neonatal outcomes were also worse in the SHP group, with lower average birth weight, higher incidence of fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries.

7. The study suggests that SHP is a risk factor for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with PE, and deserves closer surveillance during pregnancy.

1. The generation of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway has provided avenues to explore its efficacy in cancer treatment. The success of Avastin (bevacizumab) in treating various human cancers has highlighted the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments and the need for a careful cost-benefit analysis.

2. Alternative ligands for the angiogenic receptor VEGFR-2, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families, may promote resistance to Avastin. Other mechanisms, such as vascular mimicry and altered tumor metabolism, may also contribute to the development of resistance.

3. Targeting VEGF family members, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs like Avastin, may be a viable approach for anti-cancer therapy. Agents specifically targeting VEGF family members and their receptors are currently in various stages of development, and mAbs to VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-2 are being evaluated for their efficacy as anti-cancer agents.

4. Inhibiting signaling by VEGF family members could potentially have pro-tumor effects, and recent studies have demonstrated that anti-angiogenic treatments could cause increased tumor metastasis through mechanisms such as the induction of hypoxia. However, other signaling pathways, such as those driven by PDGF, IGF, and FGF growth factor families, may exert control on tumor angiogenesis and provide valid therapeutic targets for inhibiting angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis in cancer.

3. Other agents have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials, and approval is anticipated for a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor.

4. However, evaluating these agents using traditional clinical development paradigms has presented challenges, particularly for broadly active immune modulating agents.

5. Researchers have sought to identify markers of biological response associated with clinical outcome, but this has been elusive for some agents, such as T-cell checkpoint inhibitors.

6. Studies have used serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) to identify immunologically recognized proteins expressed by normal and malignant prostate tissue.

7. Researchers have identified hundreds of immunologically recognized proteins associated with prostate tissue and/or recognized by patients with prostate cancer.

8. A subset of 23 antigens was recognized in patients with prostate cancer and individuals with symptomatic prostatitis, suggesting that autoantibody signatures might be useful for identifying inflammatory conditions of the prostate.

2. The researchers used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as a substrate for MC3T3 cells to investigate the concept of using piezoelectric materials for osteoblast mechanical stimulation.

3. The PVDF films were coated with an acrylic polymer and 4% bone-like particles to improve cell adhesion and electrical insulation, and were then subjected to dynamic conditions to stimulate the cells.

4. The study found that the total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher compared to static controls, with an increment of bone occupied area due to new bone formation.

5. The mineral apposition rate was also significantly higher around actuated devices, with a higher expression of osteopontin (OPN) in areas z3 and z4, suggesting a mechanical stress response.

6. The study suggests that the increased OPN expression is associated with mechanical stress, and is not accompanied by a proportional increase in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression.

7. The results indicate that the piezoelectric materials and converse piezoelectric effect may be used to effectively stimulate bone growth at the bone-implant interface, eliciting an early response.

3. The study also found a positive correlation between serum L-fucose levels and TNM stages of OSCC, with levels increasing as the stages progressed.

4. The study suggested that serum L-fucose levels can be used as a biochemical indicator of cancer detection, staging, therapeutic success, prognosis, and as a post-treatment evaluation tool.

5. The study found that serum L-fucose levels remained constant among healthy individuals and were raised proportionately in OSCC patients, commensurate with the stage of cancer.

2. Lcn2 mice gained more body weight and increased adiposity, particularly when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or aged, compared to wild-type mice. The weight of white and brown fat pads, liver, heart, kidney, and spleen were significantly higher in HFD-fed lcn2 mice.

3. Lcn2 mice displayed cold sensitivity and could not survive when exposed to 4°C for >10 hours. The rectal temperature of lcn2 mice dropped significantly within 3 hours compared to wild-type mice when acutely exposed to 4°C.

4. The expression levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) coactivator 1 (PGC-1) genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) were significantly lower in lcn2 mice compared to wild-type mice when fed an HFD.

5. Lcn2 mice had impaired adaptive thermogenesis and increased susceptibility to HFD-induced obesity. The expression levels of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function, such as nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), were significantly reduced in BAT of lcn2 mice.

6. Lcn2 mice developed more severe systemic insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia when fed an HFD. The expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism and adipokines, including PPAR, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), GLUT4, adiponectin, and leptin, were markedly reduced in adipose tissue of HFD-fed lcn2 mice.

7. The study suggested that LCN2 plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial oxidative function and lipid metabolism, and its deficiency leads to impaired adaptive thermogenesis, diet-induced obesity, and insulin resistance.

8. The findings provide new insights into the role of LCN2 in lipid metabolism and metabolic homeostasis, and LCN2 may be a potential therapeutic target for controlling obesity",1,{'n_points': 8}

4. Hindlimb unloading was accomplished by suspending the rats in a head-down tilted position, with their tails attached to a swivel anchored to the cage, allowing a 360-degree range of movement.
5. The study aimed to investigate whether weight-bearing contributes to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in rats.
6. The rats were divided into two groups: weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB), with 11 rats in each group.
7. The femur and humerus were harvested from each rat and fixed with 10% formalin-0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and processed for routine haematoxylin and eosin staining to assess the general architecture and osteonecrosis of the femoral and humeral heads.
8. Histopathological osteonecrosis was defined as the diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis.
9. The study found that femoral head osteonecrosis was observed in 7 of 11 (63.6%) WB rats and 6 of 11 (54.5%) NWB rats, with no significant intergroup difference observed.

2. Neonates often present with non-specific signs and symptoms, warranting a complete sepsis workup and a 7-14 day course of antibiotic therapy, typically parenteral ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin.

3. Recent reports have highlighted emerging patterns of resistance to empirical antibiotics, making the early choice of antibiotics a more challenging decision, especially for ampicillin.

4. The clinical manifestations of UTIs in neonates are mostly non-specific and of a systemic nature, including fever, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, growth failure, abnormal urination, and jaundice.

5. A study conducted at the Bahrami Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran, retrospectively reviewed 73 cases of UTIs in neonates over an eight-year period (2004-2012) to determine the frequency of causative organisms and their susceptibility patterns.

6. The study found that E. coli was the most prevalent organism (64.4%) causing UTIs in neonates, followed by Enterobacter (19.2%), Klebsiella (8.2%), and S. epidermidis (4.1%).

7. The susceptibility patterns of E. coli showed high resistance to ampicillin (93.6%), cefixime (85.7%), and cephalexin (77.3%), but high sensitivity to cefotaxime (63.6%), norfloxacin (100%), and ciprofloxacin (100%).

8. The study suggests that a third-generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside would be a better choice than ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside as the first line of empiric therapy for neonatal UTIs, due to the high resistance of E. coli to ampicillin.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders that cause a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, resulting in altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent variant, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), accounts for 95% of affected patients.

2. The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase leads to a decrease in negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, causing hyperplasia of the adrenal gland and increased virilization due to the diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens.

3. The study investigated 26 patients with CAH due to 21-OHD, who were followed at the Department of Endocrinology in Mahdia and Sfax, Tunisia. The patients were classified into three groups: classical CAH, non-classical CAH, and salt-wasting CAH.

4. The study found that 42.3% of the patients showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, temporal lobe atrophy, and hippocampal dysgenesis. The abnormalities were more common in patients with poor hormonal control due to non-compliance with treatment.

5. The study suggests that chronic hyperandrogenism, a result of non-compliance with treatment, may be the main mechanism involved in the genesis of brain MRI abnormalities. Aldosterone deficiency could also induce changes in cerebral arterial structure, leading to subclinical cerebral ischemia.

6. The study found that the hippocampus and amygdala, two structures susceptible to the effects of excess glucocorticoids, showed abnormalities in patients with CAH. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in declarative memory, and alterations in amygdala function have been implicated in anxiety and depressive disorders.

7. The study concludes that brain MRI abnormalities are an interesting finding in CAH patients and could affect white matter signal and temporal lobe structures. These abnormalities may be the consequence of hormonal imbalance during brain development and corticosteroid treatment, and more extensive studies are required to define the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens.

1. The delivery of the human genome draft sequence by publicly funded and corporate projects promises to precipitate significant biomedical advances this century, but biologists must become adept at navigating the vast expanses of genomic DNA data.

2. Surveying and signposting the genomic landscape should guide investigators towards experiments that address specific hypotheses about gene function, but different communities of biologists speak in dialects that are not always mutually comprehensible.

3. To overcome this issue, universal vocabularies need to be adopted, and there are two common ways of annotating genes: integrating information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes and relying on predicted evolutionary relationships.

4. Predicted evolutionary relationships include homologs, paralogs, and orthologs, which are genes that have arisen from a common ancestor, have arisen by gene duplication within a single genome, and have corresponding genes in different species, respectively.

5. Protein homologs have similar tertiary structures and frequently similar functions, making it possible to infer clues about a gene's function from its homologs.

6. However, homology assignment indicates only an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function, and there is a pitfall to be avoided when annotating genes by homology: homologs may be related only by evolution and not by similarities in molecular mechanism.

7. Domain architectures of proteins are compact units of structure, often with a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic exterior, and they are not divisible into smaller units, representing the finite vocabulary of protein evolution.

8. Domain identification has played a major role in understanding the evolution of chordates, and deconvolution of human proteins into their constituent domains has also contributed to understanding the evolution of eukaryotic organisms.

9. The gene ontology project (GO) has created an initial hierarchy of defined terms that encompasses many of the flavors of 'function' commonly described in biology, and it will guide the efficient navigation of genomes.

10. Ultimately, the success of the genome projects will be measured not in the completion of sequences, but in how access to integrated data opens up new avenues of research and therapy.

1. The concept of stem cells was first proposed by McCulloch and Till in the 1960s, who identified three functional characteristics: self-renewal, proliferation, and multipotency. These characteristics are essential for stem cells to maintain tissue homeostasis and repair damaged tissues.

2. Advances in stem cell biology have provided insight into the role of stem cells in the lung, particularly in the response to airway injury. Studies have identified stem cell populations in the proximal, middle, and distal airways, each with unique characteristics and markers.

3. The hierarchical or cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that lung cancer arises from a small population of stem cells that gain unlimited proliferative potential, leading to tumor growth and heterogeneity. This theory has been supported by studies showing that lung cancer stem cells express high levels of anti-apoptotic and drug-resistant proteins.

4. Recent studies have identified cells within lung cancer specimens that exhibit stem-like properties, such as multidrug resistance, increased telomerase expression, and self-renewal. The presence of these cells has been associated with a worse prognosis and increased resistance to chemotherapy.

5. The study of lung cancer stem cells has significant implications for the management of lung tumors, including the development of targeted therapies and the use of stem cell markers as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of stem cells in lung tumorigenesis and to develop effective treatments for lung cancer.

1. The study aimed to evaluate the role of the urethral plate character in the success of tip repair among children with primary anterior penile hypospadias in Yemen.

2. A total of 100 children underwent tip repair between January 2010 and December 2013, and the study population was divided into two groups based on the width of the urethral plate: group A (> 8 mm) and group B (< 8 mm).

3. The study found that group B patients with a narrow urethral plate had a statistically significant higher fistula rate compared to group A patients (p = 0.004).

4. Similarly, group B patients had a significantly higher incidence of failed 8 fr calibration compared to group A patients (p = 0.01).

5. The study also divided the population based on the character of the urethral plate as flat, cleft, and deeply grooved, and found that patients with flat urethral plates had a higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibration rate, although the results were not statistically significant.

6. The study concluded that the tip urethroplasty has good cosmetic and functional results and offers a modality for hypospadias repair with several advantages, including preservation and utilization of the urethral plate without the need for additional flaps.

7. The study found that patients with flat and narrow urethral plates developed more complications, and recommended the use of buccal mucosal graft (BMG) with tip repair to augment the narrow urethral plate.

8. The study's findings are in accordance with earlier reports by Holland and Smith, Nguyen et al., and Tavakkoli Tabassi and Mohammadi Rana, who also found a higher fistula rate in patients with narrow urethral plates.

9. The study suggests that urethral plate augmentation is recommended when the urethral plate is narrow and inelastic, requiring augmentation with free graft.

10. The study's results provide evidence of excellent outcomes in hypospadias management through tip repair, with an overall 8% of patients developing fistula, 12% patients with failed 8 fr calibration, and 1% partial dehiscence.

1. The study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo, using a strain gauge connected directly to the pliers where the bracket debonding occurs, and to compare the bond strength obtained with the prototype in vitro using a universal testing machine.

2. The prototype was developed by modifying a polypropylene plier with a strain gauge connected to the claw, and an electronic circuit that performs the reading of the strain gauge and changes the obtained value into an 8-bit binary number.

3. The study compared the mean bond strength obtained in group 1 (2.96 MPA) and in group 2 (3.08 MPA) using the tensile test in a universal testing machine, and found that they were statistically similar.

4. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores showed that the fracture pattern was predominantly score 3 in both groups, indicating that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding.

5. The study concluded that the prototype is a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo, and that debonding with the prototype is a safe method for preserving the enamel surface.

1. Trichomonas vaginalis infection is one of the most common curable sexually transmitted infections, with an estimated 173 million new cases occurring annually, according to the World Health Organization. The infection has been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery.

2. A study conducted in Peru found that the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis infection was higher among older women, those with less education, single women, and women who reported unprotected sex with a non-steady partner or multiple sex partners. The study also found that the infection was not directly related to symptoms, suggesting that syndromic treatment may not be effective in controlling the spread of the infection.

3. The study's findings highlight the need for improved disease control activities to reduce adverse trichomoniasis-associated reproductive health outcomes, such as ectopic pregnancy, low infant birth weight, preterm labor, and non-HPV associated cervical neoplasia. The study also emphasizes the importance of screening and treating sex partners of infected women to prevent reinfection and reduce infection prevalence and complications in untreated males.

4. The study's results suggest that screening and treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis infection could improve reproductive health and birth outcomes of women, particularly in populations with high prevalence of the infection. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of screening and treatment programs in reducing the burden of Trichomonas vaginalis infection and its associated reproductive health outcomes.

1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, classified as a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome by the International League Against Epilepsy.

2. The syndrome is characterized by tonic seizures, atonic (drop attacks), and atypical absence seizures, with some patients also developing myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, or partial seizures.

3. The interictal awake electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern in LGS typically shows slow spike-wave discharges (less than 3 Hz) with a generalized distribution.

4. Cognitive impairment, including moderate to severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders, is a key feature of LGS, affecting over 75% of children with the syndrome.

5. The typical age of onset of LGS is between 2 and 5 years, with boys being affected about 5 times more often than girls.

6. The prognosis of LGS is poor, with regard to both seizures and cognitive outcome, and risk factors for a poor cognitive prognosis include symptomatic etiology, history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset.

7. LGS is notoriously difficult to treat due to its encephalopathic nature and multiple seizure types, and many drugs reduce seizures initially but lose effectiveness over time.

8. Rufinamide, a novel anticonvulsant, has been shown to be effective in reducing seizures in LGS, including tonic-atomic seizures, and has a good safety profile with minimal expected side effects.

9. Rufinamide's mechanism of action is thought to involve decreased firing of high-frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation, although other mechanisms may also be involved.

10. Further studies are needed to establish the role of rufinamide in the treatment algorithm for LGS and to define its relationship to prior drugs with reported effectiveness in the syndrome.

1. The study investigated the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica) in central Spain. The researchers found that males and females from each population secreted a unique mixture of compounds in their femoral gland secretions, which could be used to characterize males from each population.

2. Chemosensory recognition experiments showed that individuals of P. hispanica from each population could detect scents of lizards from any population, but they varied in their responses to scents from different populations. Males from northern populations showed more interest in scents from northern females, while males from southern populations showed more interest in scents from southern females.

3. The study suggests that there may be reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation between some populations of P. hispanica, possibly mediated by the role of chemical signals in sexual interactions. However, further mating experiments are needed to test this hypothesis, and the reproductive isolation between all distinct populations of P. hispanica is not entirely clear.

1. According to WHO experts, if rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, the potential of passing the virus through the placenta and reaching the fetus is about 90%. This can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), a serious complication.

2. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital infection with the rubella virus and CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.

3. The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the RA27/3 virus strain, which induces seroconversion in 95% of vaccinated persons and provides immunity similar to natural infection.

4. Studies in various countries, including Australia, Denmark, and Iran, have shown a significant decrease in CRS cases after implementing rubella vaccination programs.

5. In Iran, a study conducted in 2006 found that mass vaccination of rubella caused a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibodies from 20.42% to 0.7% among Kermanshahi girls at marriage.

6. The study also found that the immunity rate increased from 79.6% in unvaccinated girls to 99.3% in vaccinated girls, with a significant rise of 19.7% in seropositivity and immunity against rubella.

7. The results of this study and others in Iran and other countries demonstrate the effectiveness of the RA27/3 vaccine in eliminating rubella and CRS, and suggest that screening for rubella immunity may no longer be necessary in vaccinated populations.

1. The use of quantum dots (QDs) in non-amplified whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization (WISH) has been explored as a potential alternative to traditional methods. QDs have ideal optical properties, including strong fluorescent signal emission, long excited state lifetime, and resistance to photobleaching, making them suitable for detecting multiple mRNAs in WISH protocols.

2. The authors have successfully used QDs to detect endogenous mRNAs in Xenopus embryos, achieving high signal intensities and resolution without the need for enzymatic amplification. They have also demonstrated the ability to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously using spectrally distinguishable QDs.

3. The QD-based WISH protocol has several advantages over traditional methods, including the ability to remain localized and fluorescent for more than an hour after the embryo is cleared, and the potential to provide three-dimensional maps of expression at a previously unattainable resolution. The authors propose that QDs could be introduced as alternative fluorophores in other fluorescent in situ hybridization assays where their spectral properties can offer significant advantages.

1. Pancreatic cancer is a devastatingly lethal disease with the highest mortality and lowest one, three, and five-year relative survival rates of all cancers in the United States.

2. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential among pancreatic cancer histopathologic subtypes.

3. The median survival time after PDAC diagnosis is about four months, with only about 19% of patients surviving past one year and only about 2% surviving past five years.

4. Cox proportional regression models have been used to estimate the relative impact of distinct risk factors on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC, and demographic factors such as gender, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, and time period of diagnosis have a significant impact on survival.

5. Clinical factors such as tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases also have a significant influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC.

6. Surgical resection of the tumor, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, has the most dramatic influence on the survival of patients diagnosed with PDAC, but less than 20% of patients are suitable for surgical resection.

7. A web-based, real-time prognostic tool was developed using SEER data on 18,352 pathologically confirmed cases of PDAC diagnosed between 2004 and 2009, which estimates survival and conditional survival probabilities, as well as their corresponding standard errors.

8. The tool uses Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted by demographic, clinical, and medical treatment covariates, and its reliability and generalizability were proven by calibration and discrimination abilities, validated by the use of both internal and external datasets.

9. The tool has several potential limitations, including the use of variables provided by SEER, the absence of information on chemotherapy, and the estimation of the prognostic index, but it has distinct advantages over existing models and tools, including its applicability to the vast majority of PDAC patients and its real-time prediction of conditional and unconditional survival probabilities.

2. Aspirin therapy is a recommended prevention measure to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, but its use is not always aligned with the objectively computed future risk of CVD.

3. A study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012 to examine the relationship between physician recommendations for aspirin use and the risk of CVD.

4. The study found that among individuals eligible for primary prevention, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and that over three-fourths of primary-prevention patients were classified as low risk.

5. Logistic regression models showed that education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention among all primary-prevention patients.

6. The study also found that there was a persistent problem with access to care and receipt of recommendations for aspirin use, with lack of health insurance being a significant barrier to accessing health care, especially for preventive services.

2. The cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms, and increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs.

3. Research has shown that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generation is required for the activation of the Notch and Wnt-β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, respectively, and that mROS act as pro-differentiation signals.

4. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation are poorly understood, but it is thought that mitochondrial metabolism may provide substrates for histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone demethylases, and that nutrient-dependent regulation of chromatin may play a role.

1. The OECD and EPA have established guidelines for investigating thyroid toxicity in vertebrates, focusing on frog metamorphosis due to its sensitivity to endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

2. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic environment, making them a suitable model for studying thyroid disruption.

3. The thyroid gland secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted to a more biologically active form, 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (T3), mainly in peripheral target tissues.

4. The transport of thyroid hormones (THs) in the blood is accomplished through binding to transport proteins, predominantly transthyretin (TTR), with conjugation and degradation processes occurring in the liver and subsequent secretion in bile.

5. Several processes influence the thyroid hormone balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation, and inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity can disrupt TH synthesis and secretion.

6. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as halogenated phenol and phenolic compounds, p-nitrophenol, dopamine, 17beta-estradiol (E2), and dihydroxyepiandrosterone, can inhibit TH sulfating activity in frog tadpoles.

7. The amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) has been established as a guideline for testing chemicals for thyroid-disrupting activity, using Xenopus laevis as a model species, and has undergone extensive validation programs.

8. The AMA has been shown to be sensitive and reliable for detecting antithyroidal activity, but less useful for weak agonistic effects, and thyroid gland histology is one of the primary endpoints in the test guidelines.

9. The morphology of the amphibian thyroid gland changes continuously throughout metamorphosis, making it essential for well-experienced toxicologic pathologists to interpret the histopathology of the thyroid gland accurately.

1. The study aimed to explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related quality of life (QOL) in Iran. The study found that women who had vaginal deliveries (VD) had better physical health at 2 months after delivery compared to those who had cesarean sections (CS).

2. The study used a prospective design and included 342 women who gave birth in 10 health centers in Kashan city, Iran. The women were followed up at 2 and 4 months after delivery, and their QOL was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire.

3. The results showed that women who had VD had higher total physical health scores at 2 and 4 months after delivery compared to those who had CS. Specifically, the differences were significant for physical functioning (PF) and role limitation due to physical problems (RP) at 2 months, and for PF at 4 months.

4. In contrast, women who had CS had higher total mental health scores at 2 months after delivery, but the differences were not significant. However, at 4 months after delivery, women who had VD had higher total mental health scores compared to those who had CS.

5. The study also found that women who had VD showed more improvements in mental health-related QOL from 2 to 4 months after delivery compared to those who had CS. Specifically, the differences were significant for social functioning (SF) and emotional well-being (EW).

6. The study's findings are consistent with some previous studies, but differ from others. For example, a study in rural China found no significant differences in QOL between women who had VD and CS, while a study in Iran found that women who had planned CS had higher QOL scores compared to those who had VD.

7. The study's limitations include the use of a general instrument to assess QOL, and the fact that the type of CS (elective or emergency) was not considered. The study recommends that future studies include both general and specific questionnaires to assess postpartum QOL among women with VD, elective CS, and emergency CS, and that social and cultural factors related to physical and mental health-related QOL after delivery be recognized.

1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943, categorizes human needs into a pyramid structure, with physiological needs at the bottom, followed by safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization.

2. Safety needs, which include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being, are more fundamental than physiological needs and can block them. Maslow found that adults usually inhibit the reaction for safety needs, but infants exhibit a more direct reaction to safety threats.

3. The amygdala is the neural basis for fear and is also recognized as the neural basis for stress-elicited fear and anxiety. The ne/LC system is important for directing behaviors to cope with a dangerous environment and inducing fight or flight behaviors.

4. The appraisal theory, proposed by Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus, states that emotions result from people's interpretations and explanations of their circumstances. The primary appraisal is a faster-activating, automatic process related to fear, while the secondary appraisal is concerned with coping options and is related to anger.

5. Fear and anger are due to things happening in an unexpected way, and the unexpectancy will also increase the tension of hedonic emotions. The neural basis for safety needs is the amygdala and the LC/NE system, which can be regarded as a safety circuitry.

6. Mental disorders such as anxiety, phobia, depression, and PTSD are related to safety needs, and the inability to cope with unsafe stressful situations can lead to depression. The emotional rainbow, consisting of fear-anger-happiness-sadness-missing, constitutes our emotions in everyday life.

1. A comprehensive study has been conducted over three decades to elucidate the involvement of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in various physiological functions, including blood pressure regulation, nociception, and anti-inflammatory activity.

2. The most prominent regioisomer, 14,15-EET, is produced through the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, specifically members of the 2C and 2J families.

3. The ratio of EET isomers and their stereocomposition are dependent on the CYP P450 isoform and thus species- and tissue-specific.

4. Investigating the roles of 14,15-EET is complicated by factors such as aerial oxidation, auto-oxidation, and enzymatic processes like esterification, metabolism, conjugation, and hydrolysis.

5. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a major determinant in maintaining the steady-state levels of 14,15-EET, with a half-life of seconds to minutes.

6. Inhibiting sEH can elevate EET levels, offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes.

7. However, this strategy may be less efficacious than agonist replacement therapy when endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised due to disease, inflammation, or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs.

8. To address the stability limitations of natural EETs, researchers have prepared several iterations of EET surrogates with improved stability, including oxamides and N-IPR-amides.

9. The most promising EET surrogate, urea 19, displays dual activity as a vasorelaxant and sEH inhibitor, with a submicromolar EC50 and a respectable low nanomolar IC50.

10. The synthesis of urea 19 and other EET analogues involves a series of transformations, including semihydrogenation, azidation, Staudinger reduction, and condensation reactions.

1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model is an extension of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) that aims to provide quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients. The model has been implemented in various settings, including primary care practices, and has shown to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient care quality. However, the transition to PCMH can be challenging, and practices may encounter difficulties such as promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, care coordination, staffing and space allocations, and leveraging electronic medical records (EMRs).

2. To overcome these challenges, practices must create their own written policies that adhere to PCMH principles and fit their specific practice structure. They must also decide whether to attempt the transformation incrementally or all at once, and provide training and support to staff members, including nurses and front office staff, to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, practices must address the issue of space and create a workflow process for documentation in patients' medical records. With the right approach and resources, PCMH can improve the quality of life for patients and reduce healthcare costs.

1. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mild hypothermia in patients with cardiac arrest through a meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included 531 adult patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated.

2. The meta-analysis found that mild hypothermia did not improve the survival rate at hospital discharge, but it did improve the survival rate after 6 months, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.25 (95% CI: 1.05-1.49, p = 0.01).

3. The study also found that mild hypothermia improved neurological function after 6 months, with a pooled RR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.13-1.66, p = 0.001).

4. However, the meta-analysis found that mild hypothermia did not influence the incidence of rearrest, with a pooled RR of 1.19 (95% CI: 0.87-1.61, p = 0.27).

5. The study suggested that the possible reasons for the lack of improvement in survival rate and neurological function at hospital discharge may be due to the whole-body hypothermia influencing all organ systems, combination hypothermia with other drugs, and the slow process of neuronal recovery.

6. The study concluded that mild hypothermia is a safe treatment for cardiac arrest patients, but further research is needed to analyze the impact of different cooling measures or different hypothermia duration on the survival rate and neurological function.

1. Approximately 40% of marital infertility is due to a male factor, which is often characterized by a condition known as varicocele, a persistent enlargement and elongation of the pampiniform plexus, venous convolution, and sinus formation with transient or permanent backflow.

2. The etiology of varicocele remains unclear, but it is believed to be related to blood turbulence in the vicinity of the opening of the testicular vein, leading to retrograde flow of renal metabolites and adrenal hormones to the testis.

3. Varicocele can cause testicular hyperemia and compromised testicular oxygen concentration, leading to atrophic changes within convoluted tubules, which can result in impaired spermatogenesis.

4. A high-grade varicocele can be detected during a meticulous andrologic examination involving inspection and palpation of the genital organs, and should be confirmed by accessory ultrasound, such as Doppler examination.

5. Laparoscopic varicocele repair is a recommended treatment for varicocele, particularly in adolescents, as it has been shown to result in significant increases in hypotrophic testicular volume and improvement in semen parameters.

6. The efficacy of surgical varicocele repair should be evaluated through hormonal tests and semen analysis in the procreative age group, and should include assessment of testicular volume, sperm count, motility, and morphology.

7. Early surgical repair of varicocele is recommended, as it can prevent long-term damage to the testis and improve fertility potential, and should be performed by a urologist or andrologist with expertise in laparoscopic varicocele repair.

1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with localized prostate cancer, but the major long-term morbidity associated with this procedure is erectile dysfunction, despite advances in surgical techniques.

2. Prior to studies done by Walsh and Donker, the cause of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy was not well understood, but they proposed and demonstrated that erectile dysfunction occurred secondary to the injury of cavernosal nerves.

3. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, with studies reporting a 16 to 76% recovery of erectile function in men whose bilateral neurovascular bundles were preserved.

4. A recent study used male adult cadavers to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and constructed a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution, revealing that the number of periprostatic nerve fibers was distributed evenly to dorsal and both lateral areas of the prostate.

5. The study found that the distances from the prostatic capsule were almost the same in both the lateral and dorsal (rectal) parts of the base, middle, and apex levels of the prostate, and that the nerve fibers in the ventral part were substantially fewer in number and decreased in thickness.

6. The findings of this study suggest that modified nerve-sparing techniques by incising the periprostatic fascia more anteriorly are feasible for saving periprostatic nerves, but an excessive high up incision over 2, 10 o'clock on the ventral part of the prostate is insignificant during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.

1. The study aimed to assess the concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with different disease activity and its association with clinical and laboratory variables.

2. The study found that SAA levels were significantly higher in patients with high disease activity, erosive form of RA, and those treated with glucocorticoids.

3. The results also showed that SAA levels were inversely associated with the corrected QT (QTc) duration, indicating a potential link between SAA and cardiac complications in RA patients.

4. The study found that patients with atherosclerotic plaques and increased cystatin C (cys-c) levels, a marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD), had significantly higher SAA levels.

5. The study suggested that SAA could be a biomarker associated with both the current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications, including cardiovascular (CV) and renal involvement in RA patients.

6. The results also indicated that persistently elevated SAA concentration increases the risk of amyloidosis development due to deposition of amyloid proteins in different tissues and organs.

7. The study concluded that repeated assessment of SAA may facilitate searching RA patients with persistent inflammation and increased risk of extra-articular complications, as well as amyloidosis development.

1. Glucocorticoids have been extensively characterized as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, but they also play a role in promoting inflammation and may promote Th2-type immunity through differential effects on Th1 and Th2 cytokine production.

2. There is a well-established association between stress and allergic diseases, including asthma, and glucocorticoids, which are essential for systemic stress responses, may promote inflammation and Th2-type immunity.

3. In a study on mice, it was found that perforin-deficient mice (pfp mice) have reduced granulocyte numbers in both bone marrow and peripheral blood compared to wild-type controls, and this defect is not due to a general lack of response to glucocorticoids.

4. The pfp mice were unable to respond to dexamethasone stimulation in vivo, which significantly increased eosinophil and neutrophil numbers in the bone marrow of wild-type controls, but the thymus of pfp mice responded to dexamethasone injection as expected.

5. The defect in response to dexamethasone in pfp mice was corrected by the intravenous transfer of wild-type lymphocytes, which suggests that the transferred lymphocytes provided something that was lacking in the recipient.

6. The ability of lymphocyte preparations to reconstitute responses to dexamethasone was abolished by depletion of CD4+ and/or CD8+ cells before transfer, depending on the granulocyte population, which raises the issue of the lymphocyte subpopulation involved.

7. The study suggests that perforin may be required for normal host response to bacterial sepsis through an effect on glucocorticoid-mediated signaling in the bone marrow, and further study is needed to determine the role of perforin in this process.

2. The majority of patients (73.9%) started on or switched to biphasic insulin aspart, while other groups used insulin detemir, insulin aspart, basal insulin plus insulin aspart, and other insulin combinations.

3. After 24 weeks of treatment, overall hypoglycaemic events reduced from 1.5 events/patient-year to zero events in the insulin user group, while hypoglycaemia remained nil in the insulin naive group.

4. Blood pressure decreased, and overall lipid profile and quality of life improved at week 24 in the cohort. All parameters of glycaemic control improved from baseline to study end in the total cohort.

5. The study found that biphasic insulin aspart, basal + insulin aspart, insulin detemir, and insulin aspart were effective in improving glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with T2DM.

6. Hypoglycaemic events were nil in both insulin naive and user groups for biphasic insulin aspart, basal + insulin aspart, and insulin detemir after 24 weeks of treatment.

7. Quality of life improved at the end of the study for all insulin analogues used, including biphasic insulin aspart, basal + insulin aspart, insulin detemir, and insulin aspart.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have also been explored as a potential source.

2. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have shown promise in differentiating into cardiovascular lineages and improving ventricular function in rodent models. However, concerns about teratoma formation and bioethics have hindered clinical trials.

3. iPSCs can be generated from adult somatic cells and have shown similar potential to ESCs in differentiating into cardiovascular lineages. They may provide an unlimited supply of autologous donor cells, but technological advancements are needed to eliminate the risk of tumor formation.

4. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be separated from bone marrow and adipose tissues and have been shown to differentiate into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. However, their propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues limits their use.

5. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. They have shown promise in improving left ventricular ejection fraction and reducing infarct scar size in clinical trials.

6. Researchers are exploring various methods of stem cell delivery, including non-invasive mobilization, intravenous injection, intracoronary infusion, and intramyocardial injection. Intramyocardial delivery has shown better retention than intracoronary delivery in animal studies.

7. Treatments designed to improve stem cell homing to diseased myocardium have the potential to enhance both the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular cell therapy. Strategies include ex vivo conditioning of donor cells and in vivo conditioning of the host vasculature.

8. Cell-based gene therapy using survival factors such as Akt-1, Bcl-2, and SFRP2 has shown promise in improving donor cell survival and differentiation in host myocardium. However, challenges remain in regulating the expression of these factors before clinical application.

9. Recent discoveries have shown that the adult heart is capable of regeneration and repair, with nearly half of all cardiomyocytes being exchanged during a normal lifespan. This suggests that cardiac cell therapy may not need to focus on cardiomyocyte regeneration, but rather on recruiting host cells to the site of injury and promoting host tissue preservation",0,{'n_points': 5}

1. Polyhalite, a mineral with the chemical formula K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O, commonly occurs in sedimentary evaporite successions and in rare cases as a sublimate in volcanic successions.

2. Polyhalite was first described from the Salt Mine Bad Ischl-Perneck in Austria by the German chemist Stromeyer in 1818 and has since been known from many salt deposits.

3. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria in 1970 and later confirmed in 2005.

4. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by a reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C.

5. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C to a maximum of 343°C, and substitution of divalent cations by other elements like Zn, Cu, Ni significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.

6. Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite, and its formation is associated with the presence of brine and heating.

7. The examined polyhalite samples of Hallstatt show a wide variety of microfabrics, including mylonitic ones that resemble those observed from rock-forming constituents of continental crust, like quartz, feldspar, and calcite.

8. The polyhalite mylonites were formed along shear zones, and their foliated and lineated rocks can be characterized by their small grain sizes and distinct penetrative or closely spaced and planar foliation with a shape preferred orientation.

9. The polyhalite samples showing crenulation cleavage and folds experienced a microfolding of the existing foliation, and the recrystallized polyhalites of microfabric type a-3 were formed due to healing processes of the fabric after the main deformation process.

1. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defense, and it is a critical pathogenic factor in the development of several systemic diseases.

2. Propofol, a highly lipid-soluble anesthetic, has been shown to have antioxidant effects in vitro and in vivo, and it is chemically similar to the endogenous antioxidant vitamin E.

3. The study aimed to investigate the effects of propofol on lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents.

4. The results showed that administration of propofol did not significantly affect the levels of serum and renal and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating that the metabolism of propofol may not be linked to the generation of free radicals.

5. However, propofol significantly increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol, and decreased the levels of serum HDL-cholesterol in the rats.

6. The increased cholesterol level during propofol administration may be linked to an increase in alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coa reductase activity, and the increased triglycerides levels may be due to the increased availability of free fatty acid, glycerophosphates, decreased triglycerides lipase activity, or decreased fatty oxidation.

7. Propofol also increased the levels of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, indicating that it enhances the detoxifying potential of the animals.

8. The study suggests that the use of propofol in patients with cardiovascular or lipid disorders should be carefully reviewed due to its detrimental effect on the lipid profile and its potential to cause cardiac muscular damage.

2. The prevalence of IHH is about 1/10,000 in men and 1/50,000 in women, with a male-to-female ratio of 4-5:1.

3. Due to its rarity, comprehensive assessment of IHH is often difficult for a single clinical center, leading to the need for multicenter trials.

4. The study utilized a web-based disease-specific social networking group to collect clinical data from 74 IHH patients in China, which is a new modality of medical research.

5. The questionnaire investigation included demographic characteristics, family history, age, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and therapeutic protocols, among other items.

6. The study found that 84% of the patients were diagnosed in general hospitals, and 56.8% were diagnosed and treated in endocrinology units.

7. The patients reported improvements in penis length, testicular volume, external genital organs, pubic hair, beard, laryngeal prominence development, erection, and spermatorrhea after treatment.

8. The study found that the gonadotropin + androgen replacement therapy (G+A group) was superior to the gonadotropin replacement therapy (G group) in terms of penis length, pubic hair growth, testosterone normalization rate, and self-assessment scores of physical strength.

9. The study suggests that androgen replacement therapy may improve the plasticity of the brain nerve network in generating GnRH, thus promoting reversal of the IHH condition.

1. Nonsurgical endodontic retreatment is indicated as the primary choice to eliminate or substantially reduce the microbial content from endodontically failed teeth, but well-compacted root fillings can restrict access to the apical foramen and impede root canal disinfection and complete reshaping.

2. The use of rotary files successfully facilitates an operative removal of the bulk of gutta-percha-based fillings from the root canal system, but many studies have reported that complete removal is not gained.

3. Endodontic retreatment might result in pushing irritants, such as root canal filling materials, necrotic pulp tissues, bacteria, or root canal irrigants, into the periapical region, leading to postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.

4. The current study aimed to evaluate the extrusion of debris apically after the use of Protaper Universal RFS and different finishing files for removing residual root canal fillings.

5. The study used three experimental supplementary files: Protaper Next (PTN), WaveOne (WO), and Self-Adjusting File (SAF), and compared their debris extrusion to a control group.

6. The results showed that the WO file used after RFS extruded significantly more debris, followed by PTN and SAF, with SAF associated with the least extrusion of debris among the three experimental groups.

7. The study found that the use of supplementary files for finishing provides a cleaner root canal, facilitating removal of residual root fillings that cause periapical extrusion of debris.

8. The SAF group was associated with the lowest percentage of debris extruded apically, likely due to its design, which allows for continuous irrigation and easy removal of debris, and leaves more than 38% of the canal cross-section free for backflow of fluid and dentin debris.

1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome, revealing its hierarchical structure and dynamic regulation.

2. The genome is folded into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), with specific long-range looping interactions occurring within these structures.

3. TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequencies of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions, and have been shown to be stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions.

4. TAD boundaries have been associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and the timing of replication domains, and serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences.

5. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, has been found to contribute to TAD boundary strength and regulate nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions.

6. BRG1 knockdown resulted in the differential expression of many long non-coding RNAs, which are thought to be involved in genome organization, and reduced the strength of TAD boundaries, leading to a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.

7. The reduction of nucleosome occupancy at CTCF sites in BRG1 knockdown cells supports the hypothesis that BRG1 regulates nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization at TAD boundaries.

8. The orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries may be achieved by enriched CTCF binding, which positions 20 nucleosomes around its binding sites, and BRG1 may play a role in this process by regulating nucleosome occupancy and CTCF localization.

9. The interplay between BRG1, CTCF, and topoisomerases in the organization of TADs via the active regulation of TAD boundary regions suggests a complex structure that regulates TAD formation and function, and further study of these factors will yield important insights into chromatin folding and genome organization.

2. The study used a cross-sectional design and collected data from 670 students in 2009 and 2010, with a response rate of 11.2% of the target population of 6000 students.

3. The results of the zero-inflated Poisson regression showed that a unit increase in university average resulted in a 0.64 decrease in the logarithm of the number of failed courses, and a unit increase in the number of failed semesters caused a 2.73 decrease in the logarithm of the odd of inflated zero.

4. The study found that the university average and quota system had inverse relationships with the number of failed semesters, and that the increase in university average and the change from other quota system to free quota system resulted in a decrease in failed semesters.

5. The results also showed that the increase in the number of failed courses resulted in an increase in the number of failed semesters, and that the university average and bachelor and master educational levels had negative relationships with the number of failed courses.

1. The study aimed to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the catalytic cycle of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ECDHFR) using thiocyanate probes and molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that the electrostatic environment in the active site changes significantly over the catalytic cycle, with the largest frequency shifts observed for the t46c-cn probe across the hydride transfer step and the release of thf.

2. The study used a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, including FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the electrostatic interactions in the active site of ECDHFR. The results showed that the electrostatic environment in the active site is highly dynamic and changes significantly over the catalytic cycle.

3. The study found that the electrostatic interactions between the protein and the ligands assist in orienting the reacting species in a geometry that maintains a large electric field favoring hydride transfer from the cofactor to the substrate. The enzyme active site environment also provides a significant portion (1/3) of the total electric field that facilitates the hydride transfer reaction.

4. The study used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the conformational changes occurring between the closed and occluded conformations of ECDHFR. The results showed that the conformational changes lead to significant changes in the electrostatic environment in the active site, with the electric field along the d-a axis changing by 15.4 mv/cm.

5. The study identified several residues that contribute to the electric field along the d-a axis, including ile14, tyr100, and asp122, which were all implicated in the network of coupled motions that has been identified for DHFR catalysis. The results suggest that the electrostatic contributions to catalysis are complex and involve multiple residues and interactions.

2. MPI relies on three characteristics of SPIOs: their superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated, allowing for high temporal and spatial resolution combined with high signal-to-noise ratios.

3. Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and guidance of cardiovascular interventions, which would allow for visualization and quantification of vascular pathologies and additional functional parameters in one examination.

4. The circulation time of SPIOs in blood is mainly determined by their overall hydrodynamic diameter, and previous reports demonstrate that SPIOs with a hydrodynamic size greater than 50 nm are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream.

5. Resovist, an approved T2* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI and remains the best-performing commercial SPIO for MPI today, but it has known drawbacks, including a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 50 nm and limited in vivo distribution.

6. A study was conducted to evaluate the blood half-life of Resovist using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), which may differ significantly from the blood half-life in MRI, and the results showed that the MPI signal in blood declined rapidly, with the average signal strength decreasing to 30% of the baseline signal 5 minutes after injection.

7. The study found a significant difference in blood half-life between Resovist manufactured by Bayer Pharma AG and that manufactured by Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, but the difference in hydrodynamic diameter or size distribution was not significant, suggesting that the mechanism of clustering of Resovist particles may be responsible for the difference in blood half-life.

8. The study highlights the need for a dedicated MPI tracer with a prolonged blood half-life of its MPI signal, and the difference in blood half-life between the two compounds is significant, but not as high as to indicate a change of application.

9. The development of a dedicated MPI tracer with ideal MPI characteristics, including a homogenously distributed iron core diameter of about 30 nm, is crucial for the future development of MPI, and research is now focused on developing a dedicated MPI tracer that can meet these requirements.

1. The study aimed to understand the host-pathogen interaction between Leishmania donovani and liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) in vivo, focusing on the transcriptional response of infected and uninfected cells exposed to inflammatory signals.

2. The researchers used a tractable experimental model of Leishmania infection and isolated Kupffer cells from infected mice to examine their transcriptional response, comparing it to that of uninfected cells exposed to inflammatory stimuli.

3. The study revealed significant quantitative and qualitative differences in transcriptomic responses compared to previous in vitro gene expression studies, suggesting that the in vivo complexity of the microenvironment created in the infected liver plays a crucial role in the host response.

4. The researchers identified a gene network centered around retinoid X receptor (RXRA) that is associated with the survival of amastigotes within the liver of L. donovani-infected mice, and validated its importance using pharmacological manipulation.

5. Targeting RXRA using a small-molecule antagonist (HX531) or agonist (LG268) reduced the number of parasites present in the liver and spleen at 4 days post-infection, suggesting that RXRA plays a critical role in controlling parasite survival.

6. The study also showed that uninfected Kupffer cells undergo significant biological and gene transcriptional changes associated with the inoculation of live L. donovani amastigotes, suggesting that soluble mediators or signals operating in trans facilitate global activation of macrophages within the infected tissue.

7. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering the in vivo complexity of the host-pathogen interaction and the potential of targeting nuclear receptors for therapy, including RXRA, to control parasite survival and reduce parasite load.

1. The control of appetite is complex and involves the coordination of inputs from physiological and environmental sources. Recent central nervous system models have emphasized inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, with major signals including leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin and insulin from the GI tract.

2. Research has shown that exercise has a dual-action effect on appetite control, partly explaining the large variation in body weight change. Exercise causes a significant increase in fasting levels of hunger, but also increases post-prandial satiety signalling from meals, indicated by a change in the satiety quotient.

3. A new formulation for appetite control proposes that a tonic signal for the drive to eat arises from the body's demand for energy, mainly from fat-free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR). This drive is under tonic inhibition from leptin, whose action reflects the amount of stored energy reserves in the body, and is periodically interrupted and suppressed by episodic signals in the form of peptides released from the GI tract in response to food consumption.

1. The study evaluated the effect of surface treatments on the shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins. The results showed that surface treatments significantly improved the bond strength, with no significant difference between applying monomer or airborne particle abrasion.

2. The study used 60 maxillary central incisor acrylic teeth, divided into two groups: heat-polymerized acrylic resin (Meliodent) and autopolymerized acrylic resin (Futura Gen). The teeth were further subdivided into three subgroups based on surface treatment: untreated, treated with monomer, and treated with airborne particle abrasion.

3. The results showed that the bond strength of the denture teeth to the studied denture base resins was significantly different, with heat-polymerized resin (Meliodent) showing higher bond strength values compared to autopolymerized resin (Futura Gen).

4. The study found that the failure mode was predominantly adhesive with Futura Gen and mixed in Meliodent, indicating that the bond strength of the denture teeth to the denture base resins was significantly affected by the type of resin used.

5. The study concluded that treatment of the ridge lap surface of denture teeth by monomer or by airborne particle abrasion significantly improved their bond strengths to the denture base resins, and that there was no significant difference between applying monomer or airborne particle abrasion in improvement of the bond strength.

1. The light emitted during arc welding contains intense ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which poses a significant health risk to workers, including welders and those in surrounding areas. The UVR hazard is particularly high in workplaces where arc welding is performed, with 86% of workers reporting past experience with symptoms of UV keratoconjunctivitis.

2. The degree of UVR hazard during arc welding is influenced by various factors, including the type of shielding gas used, the welding current, and the type of welding process. In this study, the effective irradiance of UVR emitted during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel was measured under different conditions.

3. The results showed that the effective irradiance of UVR increased with increasing welding current, with a significant difference in the increase in effective irradiance for welding currents from 100 to 250 A and from 250 A upward. The metal transfer mode also played a crucial role in determining the effective irradiance, with spray transfer resulting in a higher effective irradiance than short-circuit and globular transfer modes.

4. Pulsed current GMAW was found to be more hazardous than non-pulsed current GMAW, with the effective irradiance of UVR increasing with decreasing pulsed current. The use of 80% Ar + 20% CO2 as a shielding gas was also found to be more hazardous than the use of 100% CO2.

5. The study highlights the need for adequate protective measures to be taken to prevent exposure to UVR during arc welding, particularly in workplaces where GMAW is performed. The results of this study can be used to inform the development of guidelines and regulations to protect workers from the hazards of UVR during arc welding.

1. The study investigated the potential of microorganisms from freshwater reservoirs in the glacier forefield area of King George Island, Antarctica, to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), a type of intracellular energy and carbon storage compound.

2. The researchers collected water and microbial mat samples from five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream, and isolated 50 bacterial strains, which were characterized by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.

3. The analysis revealed that the isolated strains belonged mainly to the phylum Proteobacteria, with the most frequently recovered group being members of the Pseudomonas genus, followed by Janthinobacterium genus.

4. The study detected the presence of genes responsible for PHA synthesis in 12 of the isolated strains, with six Pseudomonas strains and two Janthinobacterium strains possessing genes for medium-chain-length (MCL) PHA synthesis.

5. The analysis of the PHA synthase genes showed that the genes responsible for short-chain-length (SCL) PHA synthesis were different from those responsible for MCL PHA synthesis, suggesting that the presence of these genes in the isolated bacteria was not the result of gradual evolution, but rather of horizontal gene transfer.

6. The study found a correlation between the presence of bacteria possessing particular PHA synthase genes and environmental conditions, with bacteria having genetic potential to synthesize SCL PHA inhabiting reservoirs with low trophy and high amounts of pheophytin.

7. The results suggest that the possession of PHA synthase genes may improve the fitness and survival of bacteria in harsh conditions, and that microorganisms inhabiting extreme environments should be considered as potential producers of PHAs.

1. The operations required to reclaim arid and semi-arid lands involve modifying topography, creating an appropriate surface composition, and establishing vegetation, with the latter being the most uncertain category.

2. Establishing vegetation is crucial for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing for productive reuse of the land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.

3. The uncertainty in vegetation establishment primarily comes from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment, with irrigation being expensive and generally not more successful.

4. A mixed plant community with the same ratio of functional groups as a natural community in the same area is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation, and diversity increases the resiliency of the plant community to disturbance.

5. The study used a land surface model to estimate the frequency of successful establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses in southern Arizona using 31 years of historical rainfall event data, and found that the average germination date for the gage 5 2-day scenario was 20 July, and for the 3-day scenario, it was 1 August.

6. The study found that 20 years had successful establishment in the first 19 days after germination for the gage 5 2-day scenario, and 22 years had successful establishment for the gage 5 3-day scenario, with the worst 10-year span being gage 5 for the 2-day scenario where between 1986 and 1995, six of ten plantings would have failed.

7. The study suggests that the bottleneck for revegetation appears to be primarily in the establishment phase, which occurs in the weeks following germination, and that funds for reseeding must be available for at least a second year to allow reseeding the following year if there is a reclamation failure the year before.

1. Major depression (MD) is a significant cause of disability and is projected to reach second place in the ranking of disability-adjusted life years by 2020. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) evades universal definition, but researchers have categorized it into stages based on the response to antidepressant trials. Despite the understanding of psychosocial and biological markers and psychopharmacology of mood disorders, TRD continues to challenge mental health care providers.

2. Neuromodulation therapies (NTs), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), have shown promise in treating TRD with fewer side effects compared to traditional treatments like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). These NTs target specific brain circuits and regions implicated in the pathogenesis of MD and TRD, and research is ongoing to establish their efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness in larger populations of TRD patients.

1. The study focuses on the use of small RNA molecules, specifically short RNA sequences, to regulate gene expression in a targeted manner. This is achieved through RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of mRNAs.

2. The researchers used a novel bioinformatic approach to design short activating RNAs (SARNAs) that target specific genes, including KLF4 and MYC, which are crucial for stem cell regulation and reprogramming.

3. The study aimed to investigate the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating these target genes in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using SARNAs.

4. The researchers designed SARNAs that target the promoter regions of KLF4 and MYC genes, and tested their ability to upregulate the expression of these genes in MSCs.

5. The results showed that the KLF4-pr1 SARNAs were able to significantly upregulate KLF4 mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner, while the MYC-pr1 and MYC-pr2 SARNAs upregulated MYC mRNA and protein levels.

6. The study also investigated the mechanism of action of SARNAs and found that they do not activate the interferon response pathway, and instead appear to act through specific activation of transcription.

7. Microarray analysis revealed that the majority of cellular genes exhibited concordant changes in expression between SARNAs and lentiviral transduction, but with some notable differences.

8. The study found that the pathways that were most significantly differentially regulated between SARNAs and virus samples were those involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, macropinocytosis, and regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

9. The results suggest that SARNAs may be a useful tool for studying the contribution of individual factors in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming, and may provide a safe and efficient alternative to traditional methods of gene activation.

1. Chronic kidney diseases, including end-stage kidney failure, are associated with changes in kidney structure and fibrosis, regardless of the underlying cause. Urinary tract obstruction is a common cause of these changes, leading to tubular atrophy or dilation, tubular cell death, interstitial leukocyte infiltration, and increased interstitial matrix deposition.

2. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is an experimental rat model of renal injury that imitates the process of obstructive nephropathy in an accelerated manner. The injuries caused by UUO are characterized by tubular dilatation or atrophy, inflammatory infiltration of leukocytes, fibroblast activation, proliferation, and progressive interstitial fibrosis.

3. Taurine, an organic acid and a major component of bile, has been shown to have beneficial effects on renal fibrosis in various kidney diseases, including cisplatin-induced injuries, diabetic nephropathy, and age-related renal changes. It plays a major role in some biochemical and physiological processes in the kidney, including ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, and antioxidant properties.

4. Paclitaxel, a plant alkaloid derived from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, has been reported to have positive effects on renal tissue damage after the induction of UUO in rats. It works by disrupting the microtubular network essential for cell division and other normal cellular functions, leading to cell death.

5. The present study confirmed through a quantitative survey the protective role of taxol and taurine on renal tissue damage after the induction of UUO in rats. The findings of the study revealed that taxol was more protective than taurine, with taxol reducing the volume of degenerative tubules and necrotic and fibrotic tissues by 42% and 53%, respectively.

6. The protective effects of taxol and taurine may be attributed to various mechanisms, including the modulation of microRNA-192 pathobiology and transforming growth factor-beta signaling, prevention of cell death and inflammation in nephropathy, and reduction of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators.

7. The study concluded that taxol and taurine are both effective in preventing some structural renal damage in the direct obstruction model in rats, with taxol being more effective in reducing the volume of necrotic and fibrotic tissue.

1. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses after sensing microbial components, leading to the coordinated activation of transcription factors and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial genes. However, aberrant activation of innate immune responses can result in inflammatory diseases.

2. Autophagy, a bulk degradation system, plays a critical role in the clearance of old/damaged organelles, long-lived proteins, and lipid droplets, and is essential for cellular homeostasis, cell death/survival, and lipid metabolism. Recent studies have identified mammalian counterparts of yeast autophagy-related proteins (ATGs), such as ULK1, ATG35, and LC3, which are involved in the regulation of autophagy.

3. ATGs are critical for the direct elimination of infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and are involved in the formation of autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes, leading to the degradation of the constituents trapped inside. Autophagy also plays a role in antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells and the induction of acquired immunity.

4. The loss of ATGs, such as ATG16L1, results in the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to endotoxin and enhances endotoxin-induced inflammatory immune responses. Recent studies have identified a role for both NOD1 and NOD2 in the formation of bacteria autophagosomes and in the regulation of antimicrobial responses, and have shown that the signaling pathways downstream of NOD1 and NOD2 are unclear.

1. The association between betel quid chewing and oral cancer was noted over a century ago, but it was considered a harmless practice in India due to its cultural acceptance.

2. The introduction of tobacco by European settlers four centuries ago led to the creation of a health hazard when mixed with betel quid, resulting in a significant public health problem in India.

3. The causal association between chewing betel quid with tobacco and oral cancer was established in the second half of the 20th century, revealing tobacco as the major culprit.

4. Betel nut was initially thought to be safe, but later studies showed that it was responsible for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition.

5. The incidence of OSMF and oral cancer increased among young adults due to the widespread use of gutkha, a chewable mixture containing tobacco and other substances.

6. The Indian subcontinent has the highest incidence of oral cancer, with 12.5 cases per 100,000 people, and betel nut, betel quid, and gutkha are proven carcinogens.

7. A retrospective study of 63 oral cancer patients found a direct relation between the duration of betel quid, gutkha, and panmasala chewing and the development of oral cancer.

8. Betel nut contains carcinogenic compounds, including arecoline, arecaidine, guvacine, and guvacoline, which are responsible for its biological actions in humans.

9. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have classified betel nut as a Group 1 human carcinogen, with sufficient evidence of increased risk of OSMF and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus.

10. A permanent ban on gutkha and panmasala is necessary due to their well-established role as oral cancer-causing agents, and emphasis should be placed on health education to reduce and eliminate betel nut and tobacco products.

1. The concept of patient blood management is gaining attention due to the risks associated with allogeneic red blood cell transfusions, including increased morbidity and mortality, severe postoperative infections, and adverse effects. In cardiac surgery, postoperative severe bleeding is relatively common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass.

2. Studies have shown that patients with coexisting cardiac diseases, including coronary artery disease, tolerate moderate anaemia well if normovolaemia is maintained. However, excessive and aggressive haemodilution may cause myocardial ischemia, which is reversible with a blood transfusion. The lowest acceptable haemoglobin in patients with coexisting cardiovascular diseases is approximately 6.0 g/dl (3.7 mmol/l).

3. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that red blood cell transfusions should be based on the patient's risk of developing complications of inadequate oxygenation. In patients with coexisting cardiac diseases, signs of inadequate oxygenation may include general haemodynamic instability, oxygen extraction higher than 50%, or myocardial ischemia detected by continuous 5-lead ECG monitoring. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion policy has proven equally effective and possibly even superior to a more liberal transfusion strategy, and institutions should evaluate how they approach transfusion and each physician should evaluate each patient for signs and symptoms of ischemia or imbalance in oxygen supply and delivery.

1. The process of neurogenesis in mammals was previously believed to occur only during embryonic life, but recent studies have shown that it also occurs in specific tissues after birth, including the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium.

2. The olfactory epithelium has a unique ability to regenerate and recover from damage, making it an attractive area for research on neural regeneration.

3. Researchers have been searching for an ideal cell with properties of absolute totipotency and regenerability, and recent studies suggest that a complex of cells, including olfactory ensheathing cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, schwann cells, and olfactory epithelial multipotent stem and progenitor cells, may be more effective than a pure stem cell population.

4. The olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with possible neuropotency, including globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs), which have been identified as stem-like cells.

5. Studies have shown that GBCs are capable of giving rise to neurons and all cell types of the epithelium, and may be totipotent stem cells of the epithelium.

6. Researchers have isolated and characterized GBCs from the olfactory epithelium of rats using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and a specific antibody, GBC-III, which recognizes a 40 kDa surface antigen.

7. Immunostaining of isolated GBCs has shown positive expression of neural progenitor cell markers, including NCAM, nestin, Sox-2, CD-29, CD-54, and CD-73, confirming their neural progenitor cell identity.

8. Electrophysiological characterization of isolated GBCs using patch clamping has shown that they are non-excitable, with no voltage-gated sodium channels and only leaky potassium channels.

9. The study concludes that GBCs are a colony of neural stem cells residing in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium, responsible for ongoing neurogenesis in the OE throughout adult life.

2. Microglia are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac, which express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, and develop into CD45+ C-KIT+ CX3CR1+ cells that mature into microglia, invading the developing brain at embryonic age 9.5.

3. Microglia have multiple functions in the postnatal brain, including immune surveillance, phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic neurons, and synaptic refinement, and are involved in the clearance of interstitial solutes through the glymphatic system, which clears interstitial solutes through the exchange of ISF and CSF along the perivascular space.

4. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of rapid, near-complete depolarization of neurons and astrocytes, accompanied by secondary changes of cerebral blood flow, and is associated with microglial activation, which may contribute to neuroprotection through synaptic repair, but the mechanisms by which microglia induce CSD remain unknown.

1. Misfolded protein diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, affect an increasing number of people worldwide, with 45 million people currently affected and expected to reach 76 million by 2030. These diseases have high societal costs and lead to a dramatic loss in life expectancy and quality of life.

2. The diseases have in common the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which can amplify by recruiting soluble forms of homologous proteins and propagate from one cell to another. This creates a self-sustaining, exponential vicious circle leading to disease.

3. Molecular chaperones play a central role in maintaining normal cellular proteostasis by opposing protein misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation. However, upon cellular stress, the amounts of misfolded/unfolded proteins increase, triggering the heat shock response and leading to an imbalance in cellular proteostasis.

4. Misfolded protein aggregates can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function, leading to cell death and disease progression. The aggregates can also recruit soluble forms of the protein, amplify, and propagate to other cells, making them ""infectious"" in the sense of Koch's postulates.

5. Recent evidence suggests that misfolded protein aggregates can spread in a prion-like manner, not just limited to the prion protein (PrP), but also involving other proteins such as alpha-synuclein, tau, and huntingtin. This suggests that misfolded protein aggregates propagation and amplification is a widespread phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases.

6. The toxicity of misfolded protein aggregates is thought to be due to their binding to and permeabilization of the cell membrane, leading to cell death and disease progression. Fibrillar assemblies, in particular, have been shown to be the most toxic and have the highest seeding capacity.

7. Targeting early protein assemblies involved in disease formation and propagation may represent a novel and effective preventive therapeutic avenue. Strategies such as small molecules that repair proteostasis networks, neurotrophic factors, immunotherapy, and neural stem cell-based treatments are being explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

2. The study included 346 AA patients with hepatitis C genotype 1, who were followed for an average of 8 years, and found that the majority of patients had liver biopsy (74%) and the biopsy mean fibrosis score was 1.88.

3. The sustained virus response (SVR) rate was 15% based on intent-to-treat (ITT) and 23% based on patients who adhered to the protocol, and the end-of-treatment response (ETR) was 24% when patients who relapsed following treatment were included.

4. The study found that patients who achieved SVR did not develop new cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the follow-up period, while patients who were not treated, discontinued treatment, or were nonresponsive to treatment developed HCC and newly identified cirrhosis.

5. The study also found that fibrosis, as defined by biopsy at the first visit, was the only independent predictor of HCC development in AA patients, and that cirrhosis at first visit was not predictive of HCC development.

6. The study suggested that AA patients who achieved SVR were similar to other groups of SVR patients who also had improved outcomes relative to untreated or nonresponding patients, and that surveillance in patients with significant fibrosis, rather than just cirrhosis, is warranted.

7. The study concluded that elimination of the virus remains the optimal goal of therapy, and that more effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies may reduce the risk of HCC development in AA patients.

1. Stroke is the second most common cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 5.7 million deaths, with 87% of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income nations. The disease is multifactorial, and genetic influences have been identified as a significant contributor to its pathogenesis.

2. The beta-adrenergic receptor (2AR) has been studied for its potential role in ischemic stroke, with two variants, Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, being of particular interest. These variants have been associated with changes in the receptor's function and have been suggested to influence the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

3. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the association between 2AR polymorphism and ischemic stroke. The results showed no significant association between the Arg16Gly variant and ischemic stroke, but a significant association was found between the Gln27Glu variant and ischemic stroke, with the risk allele (Glu27) being associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke.

4. The study's findings are consistent with earlier studies that have shown an independent association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism of 2AR and various diseases, including obesity, dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, and diabetes. However, two prospective cohort studies failed to show a significant association between 2AR variant and the incidence of stroke.

5. The study's limitations include the lack of haplotype analysis, the interaction between gene and environment, and gene-gene interaction, which were not studied in this meta-analysis. Additionally, the controls were selected from hospitals, which may have led to selection bias, and multivariate analysis was not performed due to the lack of individual data from each study.",1,{'n_points': 5}

2. The study investigated the mechanisms underlying methadone-induced rises in cytosolic free-calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) in SH-SY5Y cells, a model for neuronal cells, and found that methadone induced a rise in [Ca]cyt in most cells, with four different types of calcium recordings observed.

3. The study used a comprehensive pharmacological survey to identify the mechanisms involved in methadone-induced [Ca]cyt responses and found that only drugs affecting mitochondrial handling of calcium, such as oligomycin, FCCP, CGP 37157, and cyclosporine A, were able to modulate methadone-induced delayed calcium deregulation in SH-SY5Y cells.

1. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in reducing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The analysis included 10 published reports and found that RRSO was strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers.

2. The summary risk reduction estimates suggested an 80% reduction in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk and a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk associated with RRSO in women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The consistency of these findings across the included studies confirms the strong association of RRSO with reduced risks of breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.

3. The analysis also found that the risk reduction associated with RRSO may differ by gene, with a potentially larger risk reduction associated with RRSO in BRCA2 vs BRCA1 mutation carriers. However, the sample sizes in this analysis were relatively small, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

4. The optimal age at which a woman should consider RRSO is also an important consideration, as studies have suggested that RRSO in women younger than age 45 may be associated with an increased mortality, particularly if hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is not used. However, more recent data have suggested that younger women may indeed derive a cardiovascular benefit from HRT.

5. In conclusion, the summary risk reduction estimates presented here confirm that BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who have been treated with RRSO have a substantially reduced risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. Therefore, additional cancer risk reduction and screening strategies are required to maximally reduce cancer incidence and mortality in this high-risk population.

2. The study proposed a novel model of interaction between T cells and keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of OLP, in which the IL-23/IL-17 axis is involved. Keratinocytes in OLP lesions produce IL-23, which contributes to the accumulation of Th17 cells and the overproduction of IL-17, and IL-17 reversely induces keratinocytes to selectively produce various inflammatory mediators, composing the complex immune network in the inflammatory environment of OLP lesions.

1. The isolation of pure cell populations from heterogeneous cell suspensions is a crucial aspect of both clinical and basic research, with applications in understanding the body's response to injury and in stem cell biology.

2. Various cell separation techniques have been developed, including size- and density-based approaches, affinity-based approaches (fluorescence-, magnetic-, adhesion-based, and electrophoretic), and microfluidic systems that can be operated in a massively parallel fashion.

3. Size-based separation processes, such as those using micro- and nanoscale devices, can be used to isolate stem cells and other rare cells without requiring cell-specific markers or proteins, and can be easily transported and stored.

4. Affinity-based approaches, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), magnetic separation, and adhesion-based separation, can be used for fast and continuous separation with high specificity, and can be easily integrated with downstream analysis devices.

5. Microfluidic separation systems have the potential to be economically produced and easily operated in applications such as point-of-care clinical diagnostics, drug discovery, and chemical-biological agent detection, and can be used to isolate rare cells and perform downstream analysis.

1. The study aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of three morphological signs (caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL), right posterior notch (RPN), and expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF)) in diagnosing cirrhosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results showed that C/RL and RPN had similar performance in diagnosing cirrhosis, while EGF had low sensitivity but high specificity.

2. The study found that the C/RL and RPN were useful signs in evaluating cirrhosis, especially in compensated and less severe clinical cirrhosis, while EGF was an important additional finding of cirrhosis. However, the study had limitations, including the exclusion of patients with chronic liver diseases and the lack of correlation with the underlying cause of cirrhosis, and further studies are needed to determine the role of these signs in differentiating cirrhosis induced by different causes.

1. The study aimed to evaluate the relative ability of structural (SD-OCT) and functional (SAP) tests in detecting glaucoma progression. The results showed that the relative odds of identifying progression by structural or functional tests vary according to the number of tests performed during follow-up and also according to the disease severity at baseline. Specifically, SD-OCT was found to be more effective in detecting progression in eyes with less severe disease at baseline, while SAP performed better for more advanced cases.

2. The study's findings have significant implications for the evaluation of glaucoma progression in clinical practice, suggesting that clinicians should tailor the frequency and type of test according to the stage of disease. However, the results also highlight the limitations of using a single test for detecting change, and the need for algorithms that provide a combination of structural and functional data to effectively monitor the disease continuum.

1. The healthcare industry is facing significant challenges, including the need to improve access, cost, and quality of care, which can be addressed through new technologies and innovations. However, research-based institutions are experiencing stress due to increased competition for limited funding, resulting in fewer grants and discoveries.

2. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in fundamental research and development, which can be achieved by providing educational opportunities to help investigators understand and address commercialization challenges.

3. Successful innovation in healthcare requires navigating a long and challenging journey between basic research and commercialization, and the so-called ""valley of death"" is a significant obstacle for health innovations, particularly those without a promising commercialization pathway.

4. Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPS) are emerging as an option for academic investigators, aiming to strike a balance between advancing projects into commercialization and building the skills of team members.

5. HCPS can be designed to address the unique challenges facing healthcare innovators, including buying dynamics, reimbursement complexity, regulatory pathway, culture, and funding requirements, by incorporating industry experts, healthcare examples, and customized content.

6. Effective HCPS should include team composition with diverse perspectives, executive faculty with industry experience, and content that addresses specific healthcare challenges, as well as a strong rapport between faculty and team members.

7. HCPS offer institutions and funders a cost-effective way to increase the likelihood of selecting and advancing projects to commercialization and patient impact, while also helping build innovation capacity and teaching academic-based investigators important skills in a learn-by-doing mode.

1. Bladder cancer is the second most common cancer in the urogenital tract, with about 85% of cases limited to the urinary bladder and the remaining 15% showing expansion beyond it.

2. The first confirmed carcinogenic factors for bladder cancer were aromatic amines, and it is now known that smoking is a major risk factor, with about 1.1 billion smokers worldwide.

3. In Poland, about 9.5 million people smoke, including 43% of men and 22% of women, and passive smoking is also a widespread phenomenon, mainly at home and work.

4. A study was conducted to assess the reliability of patients' smoking history and compliance with smoking cessation recommendations, using a questionnaire and measurement of cotinine levels in urine.

5. The study found that 36% of patients had cotinine levels indicating active smoking, while 59% had no cotinine in their urine, and the questionnaire results were not always consistent with the cotinine levels.

6. The study suggests that detection of cotinine levels in urine is a convenient and objective way to assess smoking history and can help to effectively convey recommendations for quitting tobacco smoking.

1. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for anal incontinence in an unselected female population across parity groups in the second trimester of pregnancy. The study found that 8.4% of the women reported anal incontinence, with the majority (80.3%) reporting complete anal continence.

2. The study identified previous obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) as the strongest risk factor for anal incontinence among parous women, with a threefold increased risk compared to women without OASIS. Low educational level and comorbidity were also significant risk factors among nulliparous women.

3. The study found that the risk of anal incontinence increased with increasing number of vaginal deliveries, with 14.5% of women with more than one previous vaginal delivery reporting anal incontinence. Previous delivery with a macrosomic infant was not associated with anal incontinence in this study.

4. The study also found an association between dermatological disease and anal incontinence, with women who reported dermatological problems also reporting more worries and other symptoms. The exact reason for this association is unclear, but it may be related to tissue-specific risk factors or increased sensitivity to symptoms.

5. The study concluded that prevention of obstetric sphincter injury is likely the most important factor for reducing bothersome anal incontinence in fertile women, and that low educational level and comorbidity are significant risk factors among nulliparous women.

1. The study aimed to compare the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine in normotensive and hypertensive patients. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the incidence of hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia.

2. The study found that the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were significantly higher in the hypertensive patient group at all measurement times compared to the normotensive patient group. However, the heart rate values did not show a significant change compared to the basal measurements.

3. The study also found that the number of patients who developed hypotension was greater in the hypertensive group (6/30) compared to the normotensive group (1/30). However, this difference was not statistically significant.

4. The study's findings support previous research that suggests that effective antihypertensive treatment can reduce the risk of hypotension after spinal anesthesia by improving vascular structural changes and decreasing basal sympathetic activity. The study's results also suggest that prehydration under the guidance of heart rate variability can decrease the risk of hypotension after spinal anesthesia.

1. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the family Papillomaviridae, with over 130 genotypes, many of which infect mucosal areas and increase the risk of cancer development.

2. HPV infection can lead to cervical cancer and other mucosal anogenital and head and neck cancers, and is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in adolescents and young women, with at least 50% of sexually active adults having had a genital HPV infection.

3. The prevalence of HPV varies globally, with the highest rates occurring in those under the age of 25 years, and in Nigeria, the prevalence is high in all female age groups, with the highest rate in women aged 15-23 years.

4. The study found that HPV IgG antibodies were detected in 42.9% of women, with the highest prevalence among women aged 45-49 years, those who had their sexual debut at 20-23 years, and those with secondary education.

5. The study also found that HPV infection was significantly associated with educational status, with women with secondary education having the highest infection rate, and that the prevalence of HPV was higher in women who had children and those who had had multiple pregnancies.

6. The study recommends the introduction of a subsidized HPV vaccine in the national immunization schedule to prevent cervical cancer in Nigeria, and improving knowledge at the population level through education on the mode of transmission of the virus and the risks associated with it.

7. The study also suggests that cervical cancer screening programs need to be put in place in Nigeria, with women being screened for anti-HPV and if positive, detecting the genotypes and having Papanicolaou screening annually to prevent cervical cancer.

1. The rapid growth of medical knowledge and the increasing number of scientific papers published have created a gap between research and routine clinical practice, making it challenging for physicians to make informed decisions. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of effective knowledge transfer and the limited use of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in clinical practice.

2. To address this issue, the concept of Evidence-Based Health Care System (EBHCS) has been introduced, which aims to provide a systematic approach to solving clinical problems by integrating available best evidence with clinical experience and patient preferences. The EBHCS consists of three subsystems: National System of Clinical Knowledge Management, National Evidence-Based Practice System, and Integrated National Network of Clinical Effectiveness.

3. The implementation of EBHCS requires a set of micro and macro strategies that enable facilitation, promotion, and guaranteeing production and application of clinical knowledge in the country. This includes policies and interventions that influence behavior at individual and organizational levels, as well as external and internal cooperation of various stakeholders. The government's role is crucial in adopting policies and interventions that promote EBM and ensure the production and application of clinical knowledge in a systematic and effective manner.

1. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae, closely related to Avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) subgroup C.

2. HMPV is an important aetiological agent of respiratory tract infections in infants, seniors, and immunocompromised individuals, causing symptoms ranging from influenza-like syndromes to severe lower respiratory tract infections.

3. Previous studies have shown that many children exposed to HMPV are easily reinfected, making it a major concern in child respiratory tract viral infections.

4. Genome sequencing and comparative analysis provide a useful approach to analyze the pathogenicity of HMPV, understand its evolution history, and cell-host interaction.

5. The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb in length, with a gene composition of N-P-M-F-M2-1/M2-2-Sh-G-L, similar to Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) but lacking two nonstructural genes, NS1 and NS2.

6. HMPV has two main genetic lineages, subtype A and B, with sublineages A1/A2 and B1/B2, and the A2 sublineage exhibits the greatest diversity among all sublineages.

7. The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV genomes, revealing a great bias towards codons ending with A/U, with no preferred codons ending with G/C, and a high abundance of A/U nucleotides.

8. The effective number of codons (ENC) values among HMPV genomes show a range from 45.13 to 48.28, suggesting a conserved genomic composition, and the nucleotide composition bias is the main force influencing the synonymous codon usage patterns.

9. The study also observed a complementary trend between HMPV and human cells, suggesting that host factors play an important role in codon usage bias, and this characteristic is important for understanding the cell-host interaction and viral evolution.

1. The text discusses the importance of comprehensive protein annotation after gene identification, especially with the increasing number of automatically sequenced genomes. It highlights the limitations of similarity searches in identifying protein functions, particularly for proteins with low sequence similarity.

2. The authors present a suite of protein analysis tools, including Protsweep, Domainsweep, and 2dsweep, which perform various tasks such as sequence similarity searches, domain identification, and structural element prediction.

3. Protsweep is a protein characterization tool that uses a cascade of similarity searches to identify protein functions. It takes into account the differences among protein databases and combines the annotation found depending on the results.

4. Domainsweep is a tool that identifies domain architecture within a protein sequence and aids in finding correct functional assignments for uncharacterized protein sequences. It employs different database search methods to scan protein/domain family databases.

5. 2dsweep is a tool that identifies structural domains in a protein and aids in finding structural elements. It predicts secondary structure, transmembrane regions, signal sequences, and other features using multiple prediction algorithms and a multiple sequence alignment generator.

6. The three pipelines (Protsweep, Domainsweep, and 2dsweep) have been implemented using the W3H task framework, which allows the execution of compound jobs using work and data flow descriptions in a heterogeneous bioinformatics environment. The final output of the task is an XML file containing all relevant information generated, which can be transformed into an HTML page for visual inspection or used for further analysis.

1. Delirium is a common and severe complication among elderly patients, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia.

2. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may shed light on the pathophysiology and help improve delirium recognition and care.

3. Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission might be involved in the pathophysiology of delirium, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor in enzymatic reactions responsible for the production of serotonin and dopamine.

4. A study investigated BH4 status, potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in patients with and without delirium.

5. The study found that patients with delirium had significantly lower levels of arginine, higher phe/tyr ratios, and lower trp/lnaas ratios compared to patients without delirium, suggesting decreased BH4 availability and disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission.

6. The study also found reduced plasma arginine levels and borderline statistically significantly reduced citrulline levels in patients with delirium, which may indicate an increased status of oxidative stress.

7. The findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and an increased status of oxidative stress may have played a role in the pathogenesis of delirium in the patient group.

8. Further research is needed to confirm the results in a larger population and explore the potential differences in the pathophysiology of delirium in patients with and without cognitive disorders.

1. The study investigated the association between personal and neighbourhood environmental characteristics and active transport among inhabitants of Dutch deprived neighbourhoods. The results showed that perceived speed of traffic was the only neighbourhood environmental characteristic associated with walking for transport, and that migrants were more responsive to neighbourhood walkability than native Dutch respondents.

2. The study found that personal characteristics, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI), were stronger associates of active transport than neighbourhood characteristics. However, interaction effects indicated that within some groups of the population, neighbourhood characteristics were important and needed to be considered in efforts to promote physical activity.

3. The study's findings suggest that interventions to increase active transport and physical activity should be tailored to specific subgroups, such as migrants, women, and younger respondents, who may be more responsive to certain environmental factors, such as traffic safety and aesthetics. The study's results also highlight the need for further research to investigate the relationships between neighbourhood characteristics and physical activity in deprived neighbourhoods.

3. The study was conducted at the Eye Clinic and Neurological Clinic, Sarajevo University Clinical Centre, from March 2009 to 2011, and involved 89 patients with verified MS diagnosis.

4. The study found that optic neuritis was most often present in patients aged 18-30 years, and the onset of optic neuritis was more frequent in female patients (70%) compared to male patients.

5. The study confirmed that optic neuritis is one of the first clinical manifestations of MS, and the most frequent disturbances in the computerized visual field were centrocecal and paracentral scotoma.

6. The analysis of optic coherent tomography (OCT) results showed thinning of the nerve fibers in the whole circumference, most often in the upper quadrant, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning was observed in all patients.

7. Pulse corticosteroid therapy resulted in significant improvement of visual acuity in all patients with optic neuritis, with a month after administration varying from 0.6 to 1.0.

1. The article discusses the role of men's socioeconomic position in demographic change, particularly in the declining rates of marriage and the tendency to postpone or forego marriage. Valerie Oppenheimer's theory, which emphasizes the importance of men's economic position in marriage formation, is examined in the context of Europe. The study uses panel data from 13 European countries to test the theory and finds that men's employment, work history, and income have a significant impact on union formation.

2. The results show that men who are not yet settled in their career, have low income, or have temporary employment are less likely to enter a union. The study also finds that the effects of men's economic position on union formation are weaker in more egalitarian societies, where gender roles are more symmetrical. The findings suggest that in egalitarian settings, the costs of setting up a household are more often shared between men and women, allowing men to experiment with their career if they have a partner with a stable career.

1. Osteoporosis in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is a significant concern due to the increased risk of fractures and bone loss, which can be attributed to impaired mobility, long-term glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, vitamin D deficiency, and skeletal muscle atrophy.

2. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in MS patients involve progressive immobilization, long-term GC treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly the presence of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of MS.

3. The degree of disability measured by the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score significantly correlates with bone mineral density (BMD) in MS patients, with site-specific effects of motor disability documented in MS patients.

4. The use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in MS patients increases the risk of osteoporosis, with doses as low as 2.55 mg of prednisolone equivalents per day associated with a 2.5-fold increase in vertebral fractures.

5. Vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients, with mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD) levels often lower than in age-matched controls, but the evidence linking vitamin D levels to reduced BMD and osteoporosis in MS patients is unclear.

6. The management of osteoporosis in MS patients involves a combination of nonpharmacological therapies, such as adequate weight-bearing exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle modifications, as well as pharmacological interventions, including antiresorptive drugs, anabolic agents, and bisphosphonates, which should be used with caution due to potential side effects.

2. There are five known species of Plasmodium that parasitize humans, with Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae being the most prevalent in tropical areas.

3. The natural transmission of malaria occurs through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, with Anopheles darlingi being the most prevalent species in Brazil.

4. The Ministry of Health in Brazil directs therapy and provides free antimalarial medicines, including chloroquine and primaquine, which are used to treat malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale.

5. Chloroquine is used to treat malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale, while primaquine is used to treat the latent tissue forms of P. vivax and P. ovale, known as hypnozoites.

6. Primaquine is the only antimalarial drug that is effective against all species of Plasmodium gametocytes, which cause malaria in humans, and against hypnozoites, but it has hemolytic effects, especially in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

7. A study was conducted in the Brazilian Amazon to evaluate the frequency of symptoms in patients with vivax malaria before and after treatment with chloroquine and primaquine.

8. The study found that the main symptoms observed in untreated malaria were fever, chills, sweating, and weakness, as well as pain symptoms such as headache, arthralgia, and lower back pain.

9. After initiation of treatment, a significant reduction in the prevalence of fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain was noted, but a significant increase in the frequency of nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste in the mouth, weakness, and hypochondrial pain was observed.

10. The study also found that the use of primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia, especially in people with G6PD deficiency, and that the sensation of itching and stinging can be quite intense, hindering treatment with chloroquine.

The study aimed to investigate the effects of a combination of alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) and antimuscarinic agent (solifenacin) on erectile function in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The results showed that the combination treatment improved LUTS, but did not significantly improve erectile function.

2. The study also found that the improvement in storage symptoms (irritative symptoms) was significantly correlated with improved erectile function in patients treated with tamsulosin alone, but not in those treated with the combination of tamsulosin and solifenacin. This suggests that the treatment of LUTS may have a synergistic effect on erectile function, but the addition of antimuscarinic agents may not provide additional benefits.

1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be expressed in a cell-type specific manner, at specific developmental stages, and in disease states, including cancer. They have been observed to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors during the initiation and progression of cancer.

2. While some miRNAs are overexpressed in cancers, the majority appear to be lost and often localize to fragile sites. Differences in miRNA expression profiles of normal compared to cancerous tissue of the endometrium, breast, and ovary have been documented.

3. miRNAs can affect the expression of a large number of proteins, including those involved in pathways relevant to cancer, such as apoptosis, migration, and metastasis. They hold promise as biomarkers for several types of cancer.

4. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal process that occurs during development, but it is also used by cancer cells during tumor progression to enable them to become more motile and thus more metastatic.

5. The mir-200 family of miRNAs has been implicated in the process of EMT, and they can repress the expression of ZEB1, a transcription factor that promotes EMT.

6. The mir-200 family members can repress ZEB1 by degrading its transcript, and ZEB1 can repress the expression of mir-200 family members by binding to their promoter regions, creating a double-negative feedback loop.

7. Restoration of mir-200c in cancer cells that do not express it causes a decrease in invasion and migration, and this effect is independent of E-cadherin expression.

8. The mir-200c-mediated repression of tubb3 (class III beta tubulin) is the cause of enhanced chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents, such as paclitaxel.

9. The increase in chemosensitivity caused by mir-200c is not due to increased proliferation, but rather due to the downregulation of tubb3.

10. Not all cells exhibit the double-negative feedback loop between mir-200c and ZEB1, and this can be exploited to identify the distinct roles of mir-200c as compared to ZEB1.

1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using a midurethral sling (MUS) placement was first described by Delorme in 2001, aiming to prevent complications associated with the retropubic MUS placement originally described by Ulmsten in 1996.

2. A similar transobturator passage using an inside-out approach was later described by De Leval in 2003, aiming to further reduce the potential injury to the urethra and bladder.

3. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, namely the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures.

4. Multiple studies have discussed the anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches and confirmed their anatomical safety from a neurovascular perspective.

5. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT-scan image analysis.

6. The study found that the inside-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the outside-in approach, which seemed to follow a more horizontal, flatter, trajectory.

7. The three-dimensional radiographic visualization of the tape's trajectory also allowed for an appreciation of the MUS tapes' spatial configuration in relation to the bony pelvis and the urethra.

8. The study's findings suggest that surgeons must pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, whichever way they choose to go, to avoid complications such as button-holing and superficial placement.

9. The study's results have implications for the development of new surgical techniques and the use of imaging technologies such as three-dimensional ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging to visualize mesh and tissue interactions in the pelvic floor.

1. The Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill aims to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment, which is currently allowed under the law in Wales. The bill's supporters, including the Association of Directors of Education Wales and the Welsh Local Government Association, argue that it will bring clarity and improve the protection of children's rights, as it aligns with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

2. The bill's implementation will require awareness-raising campaigns, training for professionals, and support for parents. The Welsh Government has committed to providing resources for the implementation, but the exact costs are still unknown. The bill's supporters believe that the costs will be manageable and that the benefits of improved child protection outweigh the costs. However, some concerns have been raised about the potential impact on social services and the need for additional resources to support families.
