Non-equilibrium statistical mechanical systems exhibit complex behaviors, making it challenging to predict their behavior accurately. Understanding the transport properties of such systems is crucial for various applications, including energy management and control.\n2. Chaotic deterministic ratchets are a specific class of non-equilibrium systems characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Studying the transport properties of these systems is essential for developing efficient energy management strategies.\n3. The transport properties of chaotic deterministic ratchets are sensitive to the parameters of the system, making it difficult to generalize results across different systems. This highlights the importance of considering ensemble behavior in studying these systems.\n4. The current reversal phenomenon in chaotic deterministic ratchets is a key characteristic of these systems. Understanding the current reversal is crucial for predicting the behavior of the system and for designing efficient energy management strategies.\n5. The current reversal in chaotic deterministic ratchets is a result of the system's sensitivity to initial conditions. This suggests that the current reversal is not a result of a bifurcation, but rather a general property of the system.\n6.

Recently, the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle that is consistent with the SM Higgs boson. This discovery strengthens the correctness of the SM. Several groups have reported an anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (\u03bcg-2), which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (e.g., see references therein). The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than xmath10, as listed in table [tab: g-2]. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, we expect new particles and interactions related with the muon sector once we regard it as a hint of new physics. Gauge interactions have been playing a central role in constructing fundamental models in particle physics history. Following this line, in this paper, we propose the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The measured muon g-2 (\u03bcg-2) and the estimated differences (\u0394\u03bcg-2) from the recent SM predictions in several references have been calculated. From the charge assignments, renormalizable terms in a Lagrangian that contribute to the lepton masses are given by xmath13. The Yukawa couplings of the charged leptons are not related to the neutrino mass. The neutrino mass is determined from the Yukawa couplings, majorana masses, and Yukawa couplings. Note that the mass terms between the left and right-handed neutrinos are diagonal. Therefore, the neutrino mixing is obtained by mixing among the right-handed neutrinos. If the majorana masses (\u03bcm) and \u03bcm are of the same order, the seesaw mechanism provides the observed order one neutrino mixing. From the seesaw formula, a relation between the parameters is given by xmath22. The interactions given by eq. (eq: mass terms) break the lepton symmetry. On the other hand, the anomaly against the gauge interaction is efficient at the early universe by the sphaleron process in the finite temperature. Therefore, the baryon asymmetry is washed out if both effects are important simultaneously. Let us calculate a condition such that the washout does not occur.

Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems plays an important role in quantum information processing.\n3. The study of entanglement essential features and dynamical behavior under the ubiquitous decoherence of relevant quantum systems has attracted much attention in recent years.\n4. For example, it was found that the entanglement of qubits under the markovian decoherence can be terminated in a finite time despite the coherence of single qubit losing in an asymptotical manner.\n5. The phenomenon called \"entanglement sudden death\" (ESD) has been observed experimentally.\n6. This phenomenon is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement.\n7. Some further studies indicated that ESD is not always the eventual fate of the qubit entanglement.\n8. It was found that the entanglement can revive again after some time of ESD.\n9. This revival entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.\n10. Even in some occasions, ESD does not happen, instead finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit.\n11. This can be due to the structured environment and physically results from the formation of a bound state between the qubit and its amplitude damping reservoir.\n12. These results show rich dynamical behaviors of the entanglement and its characters.\n13. The entanglement does not go away, it is still there but just changes the location.\n14. This is reminiscent of the work of Yonac et al.\n15. In the double-j-c model, the entanglement dynamics has been studied.\n16. They found that the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system but an identity (see below) has been satisfied at any time.\n17. This may be not surprising since the double-j-c model has no decoherence and any initial information can be preserved in the time evolution.\n18. However, it would be surprising if the identity is still valid in the presence of the decoherence, in which a non-equilibrium relaxation process is involved.\n19.

{"idx": 25, "result": 1, "generated": "1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) in either hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally framed in a two-step process that involves first a hard scattering of partons, followed by the fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.\n2. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part makes use of fragmentation functions that are determined phenomenologically.\n3. Such a production mechanism has recently been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate @xmath2 in heavy ion collisions, instead of fragmentation.\n4. It is the recombination of partons that is shown to be the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when the soft partons are involved.\n5. Although at extremely high @xmath2 fragmentation is still dominant, it is desirable to have a universal description that can be applied to any @xmath2, based on the same hadronization scheme.\n6. To achieve that goal, it is necessary that the fragmentation process can be treated as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet.\n7. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and to determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.\n8. The subject matter of this work is primarily of interest only to high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

The acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination can be accurately calculated based on measurements of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum.\n2. It is possible to measure the standard ruler scale at low redshifts, for example in large galaxy redshift surveys, and thereby constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.\n3. However, if the cmb measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, the misinterpretation could potentially spread to the low-redshift application and bias the inferences.\n4. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, is the only distance that matters in the calculation.\n5. The result is that even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the cmb due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined cmb and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged.\n6. Knowledge of actual densities, such as <xmath1>, translates into improved constraints on the hubble constant, <xmath2>.\n7.

In the absence of interactions, if impurity distributions are completely random, all states of the spectrum are exponentially localized in dimensions one (1d) and two (2d). In 3d, a mobility edge exists.\n2. The 2d - drdm model, introduced by Dunlap and collaborators, is a model that introduces delocalized states even at higher dimensions. The model is defined by a 2d generalization of the drdm potential and uses a gutzwiller approach to find the ground state wavefunction.\n3. The 2d - drdm model is studied in the context of a weakly interacting boson system, where the presence of correlated impurities leads to a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength.\n4. The 2d - drdm model is extended to a 1d - drdm model, where the presence of correlated impurities results in a minimum in the resonance energy, which is used to define the 2d - drdm model.\n5.

{"idx": 127, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Understanding Phase Transitions: From Macroscopic to Microscopic</summary>\n\nPhase transitions are pivotal in understanding the behavior of physical systems, particularly in condensed matter physics, where they play a crucial role in the phase diagram of materials. The most dramatic changes in macroscopic properties occur at phase transitions, often involving symmetry breaking. The theory of such phase transitions was formulated by Landau as a phenomenological model, later developed from microscopic principles using the renormalization group. One can identify phases by knowledge of an order parameter, which is zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase. In many known models, the order parameter can only be defined in a complicated non-local way. These systems include topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin Hall states, and quantum spin liquids. Therefore, we need to develop new methods to identify parameters capable of describing phase transitions. Such methods might be borrowed from machine learning. Since the 1990s, this field has undergone major changes with the development of powerful computers and artificial neural networks. It has been shown that such neural networks can approximate every function under mild assumptions. They quickly found applications in image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting from high-dimensional data. Furthermore, they began to outperform other algorithms on these tasks. In the last years, physicists started to employ machine learning techniques. Most of the tasks were tackled by supervised learning algorithms or with the help of reinforcement learning. supervised learning means one is given labeled training data from which the algorithm learns to assign labels to data points. After successful training, it can then predict the labels of previously unseen data with high accuracy. In addition to supervised learning, there are unsupervised learning algorithms which can find structure in unlabeled data. They can also classify data into clusters, which are however unlabelled. It is already possible to employ unsupervised learning techniques to reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model. Phase transitions were found in unsupervised manner using principal component analysis. We transition from principal component analysis to variational autoencoders, and finally test how the latter handles different physical models. Our algorithms are able to find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system which coincides with the correct order parameter. The decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation. We find that the reconstruction is more accurate in the ordered phase, which suggests the use of the reconstruction error as a universal identifier for phase transitions. In contrast, physicists use unsupervised learning to determine phase", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

For swCNT networks with thickness in the tens of nanometers, the conductance through metallic tubes dominates the conduction, leading to metallic behavior of the overall resistance.\n5. The frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity have been investigated for individual swCNTs and some types of swCNT networks.\n6. Burke and co-workers measured the microwave conductivity of individual swCNTs and investigated their operation as a transistor at 2.6 GHz.\n7. For swCNT networks with 30 nm thickness, our previous work found that the ac conductivity is frequency-independent up to an onset frequency of about 10 GHz, beyond which it increases with an approximate power law behavior.\n8. For thicker films with thickness in the range of tens of micrometers, p. peit _ found that conductivities at DC and 10 GHz are almost the same.\n9. The frequency- and electric-field-dependent conductivity investigation of different network densities is not only helpful for building a comprehensive understanding of the electrical transport properties of swCNT networks but also important for applications of these networks.\n10. The frequency-dependent conductivity investigation of swCNT networks is crucial for understanding their frequency dependent electric transport properties, which are essential for their use in high-speed transistors or as transparent shielding materials.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10}}

In particular, the importance of multi-nucleon events has been suggested in many calculations of charge-changing quasielastic cross sections. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data on neutrino experiments with accelerators. Thus, a growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by the neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented up to date in some of the Monte Carlo neutrino event generators corresponds to the ific valence model, which has been incorporated in genie. There are also plans to incorporate the lyon model in genie, while phenomenological approaches like the effective transverse enhancement model of xw are implemented, for instance, in nuwro generator. One of the main problems to implementing the 2p-2h models is the high computational time. This is due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states. To speed up the calculations, several approximations can be made, such as choosing an average momentum for the nucleons in the local fermi gas, neglecting the exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations to two nested integrals by performing a non-relativistic expansion of the current operators. The latter approach is only useful for some pieces of the elementary 2p-2h response. In this work, we present a fast and very efficient method to calculate the inclusive hadronic tensor for two-nucleon emission in the relativistic fermi gas, given by the following expression: <br><br> <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://dashscope-result.s3.amazonaws.com/160408423/160408423_1.png\" alt=\"table_denom\"></td></tr></tbody></table> </summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

An extensive review on stochastic resonance and its presence in different fields of applications can be found in @xcite.\n4. Following @xcite, as stochastic resonance we intend the phenomenon in which the transmission of a signal can be improved (in terms of statistical quantities) by the addition of noise.\n5. The problem is to estimate a signal @xmath4 transmitted through a channel.\n6. This signal has to be detected by a receiver that can reveal signals louder than a threshold @xmath1.\n7. If @xmath2 is bounded from above by @xmath1, the signal is not observable and the problem has not a solution.\n8. But, if some noise @xmath3 is added to the signal, the perturbed signal @xmath4 may be observable and inference can be done on @xmath2.\n9. Too few noise is not sufficient to give good estimates and too much noise deteriorates excessively the signal.\n10.

{"idx": 199, "result": 0, "generated": "Summary:\nThe nucleon in the low-energy regime is described by a unified chiral interaction that includes both the short-range interaction (giving rise to the spin-singlet states) and the long-range Yukawa interaction (giving rise to the spin-singlet states). The short-range interaction is crucial for the nucleon's stability and is related to the fermi nature of constituent quarks and the specific interactions between them. The chiral interaction is responsible for the short-range repulsion in the nucleon, which is also responsible for the hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the long-range attraction in the nucleon, which is implied by the Yukawa part of the pion-exchange and correlated two-pion exchanges. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the tensor and spin-orbit forces, which come from the pseudoscalar- and vector-exchange Yukawa tails. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the necessary effective repulsion in the dominant configuration of the chiral interaction, which is related to the energy ballance.

The process allows the HA to be obtained in a crystallized form, at a relatively low temperature, i.e., approximately 350-500\u00b0 C. This is an unexpectedly low crystallization temperature for HA sol-gel synthesis. The process provides excellent chemical and physical homogeneity, and bonding strength of HA coatings to substrates. The low process temperature avoids substrate metal degradation due to thermally-induced phase transformation, microstructure deterioration, or oxidation.  \nSummary 2: The invention in one embodiment is directed to a sol-gel process for preparing calcium phosphate, such as hydroxyapatite, which comprises: (a) hydrolysing a phosphor precursor in a water or alcohol based medium; (b) adding a calcium salt precursor to the medium after the phosphite has been hydrolyzed to obtain a calcium phosphate gel such as a hydroxyapatite gel; (c) depositing the gel on the surface of an implantable medical device; and (d) calcining the calcium phosphate, such as hydroxyapatite, at a suitable elevated temperature and for pre-determined time to achieve desired crystallinity, bonding and porosity characteristics for the coating on the device.

The present invention provides a fabricated implantable nerve guidance conduit (NGC) that combines a spiral structured porous sheet with integrated spiral structured porous sheets decorated with surface channels and electrospun fibers. The NGCs are designed to enhance nerve regeneration and neurite extension by providing a highly aligned surface/volume ratio, improved mechanical properties, and stable aligned fibrous layers.\n\n2. The NGCs are tunable in terms of size and length, with the length and outer diameter dependent on the size of the spiral-wound sheet. The NGCs are tunable in terms of mechanical properties, with the Young's modulus, tensile strength, and tensile properties ranging from 0.262 to 0.7625 MPa.\n\n3. Schwann cells are used as a model for evaluating cellular response on the fiber-based spiral NGCs. The NGCs show significantly greater cell proliferation than autografts and T-S-AF groups, indicating enhanced nerve regeneration.\n\n4. The NGCs are tested in a rat sciatic nerve defect to evaluate their effect on peripheral nerve regeneration through porous spiral NGCs. The recovery of motor function is assessed using a walking track, with significant improvements in the autograft group.\n\n5. The NGCs are evaluated for their functional recovery through electrophysiological assessment. The results show that the NGCs can accelerate muscle reinnervation compared to autografts.\n\n6. The NGCs are characterized by their total neural tissue coverage, muscle weight ratio, muscle fiber diameter, and fiber coverage per cross section. The autograft group shows a significant difference in these parameters compared to the other groups.\n\n7. The NGCs are evaluated for their potential to prevent muscle atrophy and the effect of autograft.

{"idx": 231, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>1. The invention is based on a generic hydraulic unit for a vehicle brake system. The hydraulic unit has at least one pump that has a piston, and the piston is indirectly drivable by an electric motor via an eccentric that is rotatable inside an eccentric chamber. Because it cannot be precluded that the moving piston may entrain pressure fluid into the eccentric chamber through a sealing ring or the like on the occasion of pump operation, a conduit extends downward from the eccentric chamber and opens to the atmosphere through a housing block that receives the at least one pump; a check valve that can open toward the atmosphere is built into the conduit. Pressure fluid that has been entrained into the eccentric chamber and drips from the piston enters the conduit and stresses the check valve, causing it to open, and finally flows out of the housing block. As a result, filling of the eccentric chamber with pressure fluid is averted, so that pressure fluid remains far away from the electric motor, or in other words does not penetrate the electric motor and impair the operability thereof. 2. In a hydraulic unit known from International Patent Disclosure WO 96/13416, the electric motor is located above an eccentric chamber, in which the eccentric acting on at least one piston of a pump is rotatable. Once again, a conduit leads downward from the eccentric chamber, directly or indirectly to a so-called central venting point, where an element is installed that is permeable to air but not to water from the environment, so as to equalize the pressure of the eccentric chamber, for instance, relative to the ambient atmosphere and on the other hand to prevent at least splashing water from entering the unit. As an additional provision, the central venting point may have a check valve mentioned in this aforementioned patent disclosure.

One of the preferred synthetic routes involves preparation of the triazolothiadiazines 1 and subsequent desulfurization reaction to give the pyrazolotriazoles 2. The triazolothiadiazines 1 can be prepared in two ways; the first, by reaction of 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-substituted(R)-1,2,4-triazoles (4) with alpha-haloketones, or the second, by reaction of 2-hydrazino-5-substituted-(R&#39;)-1,3,4-thiadiazines (5) with acyl halides and subsequent dehydrative ring closure.

Many different types of pull tools, grap pling devices, spears, etc. have been developed for the purpose of conducting fishing operations in well bores. It is typical for wire line operations to be utilized for the purpose of introducing a pull tool into the well bore for fishing operations. \n\n<summary>Background of the Invention</summary>\nIn many cases, down hole devices are positioned within casing and tubing strings for the purpose of controlling well operations. In most cases, such down hole devices are equipped with API Standard fishing necks which normally include an undercut shoulder to enable grappling by standard installation and retrieval tools. Quite often the API Standard fishing neck will become corroded or eroded by well conditions to the point that only a stub pipe is exposed without the usual undercut shoulder that is provided on the fishing neck. Connection between a wire line controlled fishing tool and a worn fishing neck may be accomplished by means of an overshot type grappling device generally defined by a collet structure having internal teeth that establish a gripping relation with the worn fishing neck. Although overshot type retrieving tools are successfully utilized in many cases, a common problem with such tools is the inability of the operator to achieve disconnection from the worn fishing neck in the event the tool is unable to accomplish an effective pulling operation.

The invention proposes a method for compressing natural gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method includes compressing the gas at least during individual intervals to a substantially higher pressure than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by the heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and obtaining the further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure. \n\n2. The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series. Between the compressor stages and particularly after the last compressor stage, cooling by heat exchange takes place (usually air/gas heat exchange), in order to reach the required lower exit temperature of at most 0\u00b0 C., preferably -5\u00b0 C., for the re-entry of the compressed gas into the gas pipeline. \n\n3. During the warmer period of the year, in which the use of re-cooling units was necessary for ensuring the required exit temperature, the invention provides for a different type of cooling. The invention utilizes the known physical effect according to which a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure, either by throttling or with the simultaneous performance of work. In order to ensure the required exit pressure or nominal pressure at the exit of the compressor station, the invention provides that the gas to be transported is compressed to an excess pressure which is substantially above the exit pressure, for example, 10 to 50 bar above the exit pressure, to carry out at the end of the single-stage or multiple-stage compression a cooling by heat exchange, particularly by air/gas heat exchange, and subsequently to expand the compressed gas to the desired exit pressure. \n\n4.

Ground ambulance services are provided by a wide range of organizations with varying organizational structures, staffing types, types of transports offered, and revenue sources.\n2.

Providers may be affiliated with an institution (such as a hospital or a fire department) and share resources and operational costs, or they may be independent and freestanding.\n3. Providers may rely heavily on volunteers, use both volunteers and paid staff, or use only paid staff. Providers may specialize in nonemergency transports, or offer both nonemergency and emergency (those responding to a 911 call) transports.\n4. Some providers offer only basic life support (BLS) services, while others offer advanced life support (ALS) services. ALS services require the skills of a medical technician who is more specialized and trained, such as a paramedic, than the technician who can provide BLS services.\n5. Revenue sources depend on the resources available in communities and communities' choices about funding ambulance services. They may include community tax support, charitable donations, in-kind contributions, state and federal grants, subscription programs, and payments from Medicare or Medicaid and private health insurance companies (including patient copayments or coinsurance).\n6.

The maturation of the baby boom generation (born between 1946 and 1964) is progressing to the point where boomers will soon begin moving from the traditional working ages to the ages when many people start to retire.\n2. The first wave of the baby boom generation will start turning age 65 in 2011 and the last of the boomers will be 65 in 2029.\n3. This development will lead to significant changes in the ratio of the working age population to the population age 65 or older. The aged dependency ratio will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% by 2030.\n4. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only occurring because of the growing numbers of older persons but also due to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers over the last decade.\n5. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer. Social Security provides monthly benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured workers. These benefits are the primary source of income (more than 50%) for nearly 57% of the population age 65 and older.\n6. In April 2000, the practice of reducing Social Security benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age (currently 65 years and 4 months) was eliminated, at least in part to remove the disincentive to work.\n7. The delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is steadily being increased until it reaches 8% per year in 2008.\n8. Prior to these increases, those who chose to work beyond normal retirement age might receive less Social Security over their lifetime because the start of their benefit receipt was delayed. Some members of Congress have also put forward proposals that would raise normal retirement age for benefits beyond the current schedule of increases, as well as proposals that increase the early retirement age of 62.

The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records.\n4. The act describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her name or another personal identifier.\n5. It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier.\n6. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public by a \u201csystem-of-records notice\u201d: that is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personal information.\n7. Among other provisions, the act also requires agencies to define and limit themselves to specific predefined purposes.\n8. For example, the act requires that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal program.\n9. The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee; these principles were intended to address what the committee termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under contemporary law.\n10.

DOD relies on its research laboratories and test facilities to develop new technologies and systems that improve and enhance military operations and ensure technological superiority over adversaries.\n2. Historically, DOD has experienced problems in bringing technologies out of the lab environment and into real use. At times, technologies do not leave the lab because their potential has not been adequately demonstrated or recognized. In other cases, acquisition programs that receive the bulk of DOD's funding in research, development, testing, and evaluation of technology are unwilling to fund final stages of development of promising technologies, preferring to invest in other aspects of the program that are viewed as more vital to success.\n3. DOD and Congress have established a number of \"technology transition\" programs, each with a particular focus. (See table 1.) The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, for example, was initiated by DOD in 1994 as a way to get technologies that meet critical military needs into the hands of users faster and at less cost than the traditional acquisition process. Under this program, military operators test prototypes that have already been developed and matured in realistic settings. If they find the items to have military utility, DOD may choose to buy additional quantities or just use the remaining items after the demonstration. In 1980, DOD established the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program to identify, evaluate, and procure technologies that have already been developed and tested in other countries\u2014saving DOD the costly burden of maturing the technology itself. Other programs include those that seek to quickly identify and solve production problems associated with technology transition (the Manufacturing Technology Program\u2014MANTECH) and to partner with the commercial sector in completing projects that are useful to both military and industry (the Dual Use Science and Technology program). Even taken together, however, these programs represent a very small portion of DOD dollars spent on applied research and advanced technology development\u2014about $9 billion annually\u2014and considerably less of total money spent on the later stages of technology development, which includes an additional $60 billion spent on advanced component development and prototypes, largely within weapons acquisition programs. As such, they cannot single-handedly overcome transition problems, but rather demonstrate various ways to ease transition and broaden participation from the industrial base.\n4. Three of the more recent initiatives include the TTI and DACP, both established by Congress in fiscal year 2003, and the Quick Reaction Fund, established by DOD the same year.

Workers age 50 and over may be eligible for Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance, a wage supplement program. After a brief discussion of the program's purpose and most recent reauthorization, this report describes TAA as reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA, Title IV of P.L. 114-27 ). Reduced barriers to international trade are widely acknowledged to offer benefits to consumers in the form of increased choices and lower prices. Expanded trade may also offer expansionary opportunities to firms that produce goods or services that see increased exports. Reduced barriers to trade may, however, have concentrated negative effects on domestic industries and workers that face increased competition. TAA is designed to provide readjustment assistance to workers who suffer dislocation (job loss) due to foreign competition or offshoring. Generally, TAA provides a more robust set of benefits and services than would be available to a worker who lost his or her job for reasons other than foreign competition. TAA is designed to assist workers who have been adversely affected by reduced trade barriers and increased trade. Its availability to workers who are adversely affected by declines in international trade may be limited. TAA was created in 1962 and, historically, has been reauthorized alongside expansionary trade policies. A detailed legislative history of the program is in the Appendix .

The proposed revisions to section 1113 would constrain both debtor companies and the courts when debtors file under chapter 11. The bill clearly contemplates allowing labor groups to have a greater, possibly definitive, role in determining the feasibility of reorganization. Labor groups, but not debtors, would be allowed to request arbitration rather than a court hearing to determine approval of a debtor's request to reject a CBA. In certain circumstances, the bill would allow labor groups to obtain future relief due to changed circumstances without having to bargain with the company. Finally, the bill provides labor groups with a defined remedy for rejection of a CBA, though courts might differ in their interpretation of that remedy. Companies in financial distress may argue that the bill's proposed changes to chapter 11 are insufficiently flexible to allow successful reorganization.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2}}

{"idx": 614, "result": 0, "generated": "Summary 1: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide, particularly prevalent in developing countries and males. Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases. HCC is refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations. Currently, systemic therapeutic options in locally advanced or metastatic HCC are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting RAF kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. The transition from normal hepatocyte to HCC is not fully understood, and hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex multistep process driven by accumulation of heterogeneous molecular alterations from initial hepatocyte injury to metastatic invasion. Dysplastic nodules progress to early HCC through cumulative genetic alterations, while advanced HCC often involves intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion. Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) axis plays a crucial role in tumor progression, serving as a hub for multiple heterogeneous signaling networks and modulating the activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of HGF and cMET [37,41] is observed in 33% and 2048% of HCC samples, respectively, and dysregulated HGF and cMET signaling upregulates protease production and cell dissociation via extracellular matrix degradation, facilitating tumor invasiveness and metastasis.

Recent studies have confirmed that type 2 diabetes does indeed confer increased risk for certain types of malignancies, particularly breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors.\n5. The clinical implications remain controversial, particularly when studies pertaining to untransformed cells did not support any mitogenic potential.\n6. The question of whether glargine is associated with increased cancer risk compared to other commonly used forms of insulin is now foreseen in the publication of several studies in diabetologia.\n7. The short duration of exposure and observation as well as the lack of data on how much insulin the patients were taking limit the strength of the conclusions.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

Tibial adamantinoma is a rare primary bone tumor that can cause diagnostic dilemmas, especially with clinical presentations of uncommon regional nodal metastases.\n2. The tumor originates from fibrous dysplasia and is considered a spectrum of disease with evidence of progression from osteofibrous / fibrous dysplasia to adamantinoma in some cases.\n3. Tibial adamantinomas can be divided into two main groups based on their histology and biological behavior.\n4. The tumor is most commonly localized in the tibial diaphysis, rarely involving other bones of the appendicular skeleton.\n5. The association of fibrous dysplasia with adamantinoma was first described by Cohen et al. in 1962, suggesting that the fibrous pattern seen in such cases is different from that seen in classical fibrous dysplasia.\n6. Tibial adamantinomas can present at any age but are most commonly in the second to fourth decade, with a higher prevalence in males and a reported range of 1565 years.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6}}

The antireflection (AR) technology plays a crucial role in the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells by increasing light coupling into the active region of devices.\n2. Generally, a relatively low-light reflectivity can be obtained for crystalline silicon solar cells by combining surface texturization with six-nanometer thin-film deposition.\n3. However, to further reduce the light reflectivity for the improvement of solar cell efficiency, various nanostructures with size comparable to the wavelength of the light are proposed, such as photonic crystals, porous structures, plasmoids, monics, etc.\n4. All these nanostructures should be based on wide-bandgap materials that themselves cannot absorb sunlight.\n5. The ZnO material has a wide-bandgap, which has been widely used in fields such as photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices.\n6. For photovoltaic applications, the ZnO nanostructures as antireflective layers can be fabricated by various approaches like pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition, vapor-liquid-solid growth, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical deposition technique.\n7. The ZnO nanowiskers (NWS) with different lengths can be grown by the seeding and growth two-step process, and integrated into the fabrication of CZochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells based on the current standard celling technology.\n8. The density and length of the ZnO NWS have been optimized for the improvement of solar cell performances by controlling the time of growth.\n9. The result shows that the efficiency of CZ silicon solar cell can be improved by a value of 3% relatively using the ZnO NWS as the AR layer in practice.\n10. The starting samples are p-type CZ silicon solar cells fabricated by a standard process including surface texturization, phosphorus diffusion, six-nanometer film deposition, screen printing, and metallization.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10}}

The technique has been popularized with surgeons and parents alike, with reports of expanded use to patients of all ages and grades of VUR even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies.\n4. The initial success rate of DX/HA injection was 68%, with a reported worldwide success rate of 89%.\n5. However, the reported worldwide success rates differ considerably (55%89% [7, 8]), with unpublished data showing an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection.\n6. Despite the success rates continuously improving, the numbers of most institutions still differ significantly from the traditional 98% for open reimplants.\n7. The success rates of intraoperative cystograms for detecting de novo VUR in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) after a negative standard voiding cystogram were 27% in the high-pressure intraoperative cystogram group and 34% in the standard pic group.\n8. The correlation between intraoperative and postoperative study results was noted, with 5 ru patients having remaining VUR intraoperatively after DX/HA injection.\n9.

Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a wide range of causes and can roughly be divided into three categories: (1) an imbalance between the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, which is the most frequently observed form; (2) abnormal cerebral development such as partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum and neuronal proliferation / migration disorders; and (3) destructive disease processes leading to loss of neuronal tissue by vascular insults or infectious pathogens.\n2. The incidence of additional anomalies detected on fetal MRI following normal ultrasound findings varies greatly between several reported studies and depends on the severity of ventriculomegaly, the expertise of the sonographer, and the selected patient population. The prevalence of ventriculomegaly ranges between 0.3-1.5, with mild cases having a prevalence of 10-12 mm, moderate cases having a prevalence of 12-15 mm, and severe cases having a prevalence of >15 mm.\n3. The sensitivity of fetal MRI to detect fetal anomalies is limited by fetal motion, which can affect the image acquisition and spatial resolution. The accuracy of fetal MRI to detect fetal anomalies is high, but the interobserver agreement is low, especially in cases of mild ventriculomegaly.\n4. The added value of fetal MRI is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to the lack of postnatal / postmortem (imaging) correlates, uncertainty between the time span between prenatal ultrasound and mri, a lack of ultrasound findings by the fetal MRI specialist, and the lack of data investigating the sonographic detection / confirmation of fetal anomalies following mri scans.\n5. The interobserver agreement between experts using the same imaging modality is low, especially in cases of mild ventriculomegaly. The level of subspecialty training of individuals interpreting fetal MRI is significantly improved by pediatric neuroradiologists, which enhances the interobserver agreement.\n6.

{"idx": 658, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>Myosin Va (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n- terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis. The lever arms consist of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova; however, in the presence of high calcium ( > 1 m), motor processivity is reduced and one or more calmodulin molecules may dissociate from each lever arm. Single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusion search. The structural domains that are critical to myova's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction. Here, we used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains. In addition, we hypothesized that calmodulin disassociation from the myova lever arm decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, thus contributing to the motor's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium. Various myova constructs, listed as follows, were expressed in the baculovirus/SF9 cell system and purified as described previously. These constructs allowed the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains to be defined by TPM (figure 2).

Enhanced nrf2 activity contributes to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and abnormal angiogenesis as observed in diabetics.\n4. Ho-1, which is mainly induced through the nrf2-keap1 signaling pathway, is the inducible isoform of heme oxygenase that catalyzes nadph-dependent decomposition of heme to carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron, and biliverdin.\n5. The direct effect of exercise on nrf2 expression has received less attention except for a report that exercise increases nuclear levels of nrf2 in the proximal renal tubules of old rats.\n6.

The study of h pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is built upon the work of three pioneering pathologists, including Rudolf Virchow, who laid the foundation for modern pathology.\n2. Numerous examples of inflammation-induced cancers are now appreciated, including gastric cancers that are common in gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary malignancies, such as acid reflux-induced esophageal adenocarcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease-associated colon cancer, and hepatocellular neoplasms associated with chronic viral hepatitis.\n3. The idea that h pylori colonization leads to the development of more common intestinal-type gastric cancers, which are more likely to arise in stomachs already affected by chronic inflammation, has been established.\n4. The initial changes in the gastrointestinal tract are postulated to occur in the first decade of life, which is when h pylori colonization occurs.\n5. A detailed model, published in 1988, included the phenotypic markers accompanying these sequential changes.\n6. Correa initially thought that the agent responsible for promoting this slow progression from gastritis to cancer was environmental, based on studies of migrants from high gastric cancer risk areas.\n7. The model published in 1988 included what was known of the phenotypic markers accompanying these sequential changes.\n8.

Proteinuria is clinically diagnosed as pe and associated with increased maternal or neonatal morbidity and mortality compared to gestational hypertension.\n3. The incidence of pe increased in China, as the opening of the two-child policy, but there was no indicator of severe pe.\n4. Severe pe is often combined with hypoalbuminemia; we hypothesize that hypoalbuminemia may serve as an indicator of the severity of pe.\n5. Hypoalbuminemia occurs mainly due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged and increased permeability of vascular endothelial cells, leading to large numbers of proteins and liquid leaking in tissue clearance and loss of plasma proteins, causing intravascular dehydration.\n6. This intravascular dehydration may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions, which is thought to be a predisposing factor of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet (hellp) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.\n7. In addition, the reduction of hepatic blood flow due to the production of albumin is decreased in two recent studies, indicating that maintaining adequate blood protein levels during early pregnancy may prevent severe pe.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

A bias voltage at (+) through the gauges was used to down-mix their resistance change (occurring at the actuation frequency).\n5. Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.\n6. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature.\n7. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same set-up, with the drive electrode disconnected.\n8. Measurements were taken with a lock-in amplifier, which also generated the drive and bias signals.\n9. The Allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.\n10. The phase of the measured signal (t) was monitored for a certain amount of time and then transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.\n11.

Studies indicate that 5 questions per hospitalized patient and 2 questions per outpatient patient are raised for physicians. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a new paradigm that attempts to direct clinical services and care toward effective, efficient services with minimal complications and errors. EBM is influential in filling the knowledge gap in helping physicians find the best evidence for patients care. Thus, it is a systematic approach for solving clinical problems which allows integration of available best evidence with clinical experience and preferences and values of the patients. The main challenge today is transfer and translation of knowledge which help physicians to make the best clinical decisions based on the best evidence in the minimum time. <summary>Healthcare System and Evidence-Based Practice</summary>\n\nThe national evidence-based health care system insures the best evidence is generated, stored, used, shared, and finally monitored and evaluated in order to provide effective and safe services in a systematic process and according to needs of different stakeholders. The ultimate goal of the health care system in every country is maintaining and improving community health. Achieving this goal depends on effectiveness of delivered services and consistency of the services with national and local priorities. The role and importance of evidence-based practice and its remarkable impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical services and healthcare are crucial.

The aim of this cadaveric study was to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach.\n7. To allow such a comparison, a device was conceived for this study in which the tape on one side consisted of an inside-out mus device, while an outside-in mus device was attached to the midpoint.\n8.
