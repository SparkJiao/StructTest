• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
• Chaotic systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter changes, leading to complex phase-space structures.
• The behavior of individual trajectories in chaotic systems can differ significantly from ensemble behavior.
• Current reversals in chaotic ratchets may not always be correlated with bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior.
• The behavior of the current in chaotic ratchets depends on the details of the initial ensemble and the presence of transients.
• Bifurcations in single-trajectory behavior often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble.
• Not all spikes or jumps in the current correspond to bifurcations, and vice versa.

• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries consisting of a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary.
• The lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range and the sharp cut-off around 77 minutes are key features of the orbital period distribution of CVs.

• These solutions can be static or stationary, with or without radial pressure, and have been studied by various researchers.
• The ""displace, cut and reflect"" method is commonly used to generate these solutions, resulting in disks made of perfect fluid with well-behaved density and pressure.
• By applying this method to different exact solutions of Einstein's field equations, disks with halos made of perfect fluid layers can be constructed.
• The generated disks have positive energy density, equal radial and azimuthal pressures, and decreasing surface energy density and pressure with radius.

* Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule, with payments based on the type of transport provided and the number of miles traveled. Providers with lower transport volumes tend to have higher costs per transport due to high fixed costs for maintaining readiness. Personnel costs accounted for the largest percentage of total costs in 2010 and contributed the most to increases in total costs between 2009 and 2010. The median cost per ground ambulance transport for providers in 2010 ranged from $224 to $2,204.
* Ambulance transports for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in the nation increased by 33 percent from 2004 to 2010, with growth in all service areas. The increase was primarily due to an increase in BLS nonemergency transports. Some local governments have begun billing Medicare for ambulance services to address budgetary pressures, potentially leading to increased ambulance transports. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that improper payments for ambulance services were primarily for nonemergency transports, including transports for dialysis services.

Ambulance transports per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries increased from 2004 to 2010, with the largest increase in super-rural areas.

* The taxation of capital gains income has been a topic of debate in Congress since 1913, with various bills introduced to change the tax treatment of capital gains and losses.
* The current tax system imposes limits on the deductibility of capital losses against ordinary income, with a $3,000 annual limit and asymmetrical treatment of gains and losses.
* Increasing the net capital loss deduction could benefit taxpayers in the upper income ranges, but may not stimulate the economy effectively.
* Historical changes in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses have aimed to establish symmetry between gains and losses.
* The current system allows for the deduction of capital losses against ordinary income up to $3,000 annually, with excess losses carried forward indefinitely.
* Empirical evidence shows that capital gains income is concentrated in the upper income ranges, while the benefits of increasing the net loss deduction would likely accrue to higher income taxpayers.
* Lower and middle income taxpayers are less likely to be affected by an expansion of capital losses, as many of their assets are held in tax-favored retirement savings plans.
* The primary objective of increasing the net capital loss limit is to stimulate the economy, but it may not be an effective method and could lead to further stock market volatility.
* Achieving symmetry in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses would require adjustments to the current system, such as implementing a tax credit for capital losses or adjusting the netting process to account for rate differentials.

• Myosin Va is a molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. It consists of motor domains, lever arms, a rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain. The motor's movement is driven by ATP hydrolysis, with each head taking 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. The flexibility of the lever arms and the compliance of the rod domain are critical for myosin Va's maneuverability and processivity.

• Tethered particle microscopy was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual myosin Va motors and their subdomains. The lever arms were found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0346 pn/nm, which decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium. The distal rod domain was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pn/nm, indicating a highly compliant structure. The compliance of the lever arm/rod junction allows myosin Va to maneuver through actin intersections and switch tracks on actin bundles efficiently.

Evidence supports the presence of stem cell-like cells in tumors and their association with known stem cell niches. The continuum of inducible features in cancer stem cells may contribute to tumor growth and resistance.
* Questions remain regarding the origin of lung cancer stem cells and their relationship with the tumor microenvironment. Future directions in research aim to improve the management of patients with lung tumors by targeting lung cancer stem cells. Advances in identifying and isolating putative stem cell populations offer promise for better understanding and treating lung cancer.
