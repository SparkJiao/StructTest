Next, we are given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 6 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. This means she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours.

To find out how far she can travel in 6 hours, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking separately.

Distance covered while running = running speed * time spent running
Distance covered while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles

Distance covered while walking = walking speed * time spent walking
Distance covered while walking = x miles per hour * 4 hours = 4x miles

Now, we know that Dana can travel 12 miles while running and 4x miles while walking. Since she spends two-thirds of the time walking, we can set up the equation:

Next, we need to determine how many calories you can consume from the bag of chips. If your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume.

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving. So, 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

44,"To find Charlie's net profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of making 20 candles. 

One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, so the cost of supplies for 20 candles is:
$10.00

Since Charlie can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. Therefore, the total cost of supplies for 20 candles is:
$10.00 * 2 = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
$2.00 * 20 = $40.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue:
$40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is $20.00.

- She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.
- She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we can set up an equation:

For the first 20 years, she will receive $50,000/year, so the total value of her pension after 20 years is 20 * $50,000 = $1,000,000. 
For the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30), she will receive 5% of the value of her pension per year. 
This means she will receive 5% of $1,000,000 in year 21, 5% of $1,050,000 in year 22, and so on until year 30. 
Calculating this, we get:
Year 21: $1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000
Year 22: $1,050,000 * 5% = $52,500

- Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons
- Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew
- Julia had a total of 12 spoons when setting the table

Let x be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought. After Julia bought the package, she had x spoons. Her husband then bought 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons became x + 5. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left before setting the table was x + 5 - 3 = x + 2. When setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons, so x + 2 = 12.

Solving for x:
x + 2 = 12

Substitute S = 2B into the second equation: (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Simplify the equation: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide by 3: B = 8.

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age using the first equation: S = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

Now, we are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of the plates. Twenty dozen is equal to 240 cups (20 * 12 = 240). Let's denote the cost of each cup as x.

The total cost of buying 240 cups would be 240x. According to the given information, this cost is $1200 less than the total cost of the plates, which is $36000. So, we can write the equation:

240x = $34800

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 240:

x = $34800 / 240

Next, let's calculate how much Sara will earn from mowing the lawn. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she will earn $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Adding the money Sara already had saved to the money she earned from babysitting, we get $10 + $20 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + 2 * $20 = $70.

To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to subtract the total cost from the money she already has. $70 - $30 = $40.

Given that the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5) = 2(7.5) = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Now, we calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed: 46 cookies * 200 calories = 9200 calories.

Sue's sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies over the two days.

Now, we calculate the total number of calories Sue's sister consumed: 18 cookies * 200 calories = 3600 calories.

Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can express the cost of the jogger jeans as x = 28 - 6 = 22.

The total savings Cole made is $6, which means he paid $28 + $22 - $6 = $44 in total.

Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2. Therefore, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

Let y be the original cost of the tattered jeans. We know that y - $4 = $28, so y = $32.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $22 and the tattered jeans originally cost $32.

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood costing $4, Frederick can get 200 sticks.
For a 2 x 8 piece of wood costing $6, Frederick can get 400 sticks.

If Frederick buys the 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can make 200 sticks for $4.
If Frederick buys the 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can make 400 sticks for $6.

To determine which option is the most cost-effective, we can calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:
For the 2 x 4 piece of wood: $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick
For the 2 x 8 piece of wood: $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood allows Frederick to make sticks at a lower cost per stick, he should choose this option to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make within his budget.

Solving for x, we get x = 8. This means George initially had 8 candies. 

Now, we can find out how many candies Nick had by using the fact that Nick had twice as many candies as George. So, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

In the second half of the month, there are also 15 days. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he needs to save 2x per day. So, the total amount saved in the second half is 15 * 2x = 30x.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in April is $1125. Therefore, we can write the equation:

For the remaining days of the week, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day. This means that the number of cars towed each day decreased by 4. So, the number of cars towed on the remaining days would be:
10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars

Since there are four remaining days in the week, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days would be:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, to find the total number of cars towed for the entire week, we add the cars towed on the first three days to the cars towed on the remaining days:

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate this by taking 60% of the total number of riders who can stay upright:

60% of 25 riders = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women riders

Finally, to find out how many men can stay upright on the wave, we subtract the number of women riders from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

We also know that there were 8 males and 6 females in the group, so the total number of dumplings cooked can be calculated as:
Total dumplings = (Number of males $\times$ Dumplings each male ate) + (Number of females $\times$ Dumplings each female ate)
Total dumplings = $(8 \times m) + (6 \times f)$

Substitute $m = f + 1$ into the equation:
Total dumplings = $(8 \times (f + 1)) + (6 \times f)$
Total dumplings = $8f + 8 + 6f$
Total dumplings = $14f + 8$

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, we can substitute $f = 3$ into the equation:
Total dumplings = $14 \times 3 + 8$
Total dumplings = $42 + 8$

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days:
$100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles}$

Now, we can determine how many tune-ups Jon needs by dividing the total miles he drives by the number of miles between tune-ups:
$3000 \text{ miles} \div 1000 \text{ miles/tune-up} = 3$

955,"To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find out how many beds are currently occupied. 

Currently, 1/5 of the 1000 beds are occupied, so the number of occupied beds is:
Occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, after 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted would be:
Total patients admitted = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Assuming each patient occupies one bed, the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks would be:
Total beds occupied = 200 beds (initially occupied) + 700 beds (admitted patients) = 900 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks would be:
Total unoccupied beds = Total beds - Total beds occupied
Total unoccupied beds = 1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds

2 workers produce 6 toys/hour each, so they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys/hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys/hour each, so they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys/hour.
So, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers in 10 hours is 10 * (12 + 8) = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order, the total number of toys needed is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Therefore, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours by 10.

Since Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach is 2 miles long, it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, it takes her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Adding the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the beach (20 minutes) to the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk (10 minutes), we get a total of 30 minutes to walk 2 miles.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.
Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle costs $60 x 50% = $30 more than the scotch.
Therefore, each bottle of cognac costs $60 + $30 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the cognac. John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, so the total cost is 20 x $90 = $1800.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of everything. The total cost of the scotch is $600 and the total cost of the cognac is $1800, so the total cost of everything is $600 + $1800 = $2400.
