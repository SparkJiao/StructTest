1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly chaotic deterministic ratchets, are complex and not well understood.
2. These systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter changes, leading to a variety of behaviors including reversals in the direction of particle current.
3. Mateos conjectured a correlation between current reversal and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior, but this was challenged by Barbi and Salerno, who found current reversals without such bifurcations.
4. The behavior of ensembles in chaotic systems is more complex than that of single trajectories, with ensemble properties significantly affecting the computed current.
5. Ensemble current calculations must consider the size, location, spread, and transience of the initial conditions to ensure convergence and relevance.
6. Bifurcations in the system often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the ensemble current, but not all spikes or jumps are associated with bifurcations, and not all current reversals are due to bifurcations.
7. A refined heuristic rule emerges: bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes, which may or may not result in current reversals.
8. The physical basis for this heuristic is the parameter-dependent net directed transport in chaotic systems, with bifurcations providing opportunities for current spikes or jumps.

1. The study investigates the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems (hd 3651, hd 37605, hd 45350, hd 80606, hd 89744, and 16 cyg b) using test particle simulations and observational data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET).
2. Test particle simulations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys where additional objects can exist, with protected resonances found in the hd 3651 and hd 37605 systems.
3. Combining simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision HET data and all available published data effectively rules out additional planets with masses above the solid line (indicating a minimum mass of 2 Neptune) in the dynamically stable regions of the hd 3651 and hd 45350 systems.
4. The hd 80606 and hd 89744 systems have more challenging limits due to poor phase coverage and larger intrinsic scatter in the orbital solutions, making it difficult to set tight limits on additional planets.
5. The study concludes that there is no evidence for additional planets in the six systems studied, with the tightest limits obtained for hd 3651, hd 45350, and 16 cyg b systems, where planets with masses above the solid line can be ruled out with 99% confidence.

1. The study investigates rare @xmath0 decays into light higgs bosons and into fermion pairs in the type-ii 2hdm, lepton-specific 2hdm, nmssm, and nmssm models, motivated by the potential of the gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ILC) to probe new physics.
2. The models predict a light cp-odd higgs boson @xmath0, which can decay into light higgs bosons or fermion pairs, with branching ratios potentially accessible at the gigaz.
3. Theoretical constraints from various experiments, such as the LHC, LEP, and muon anomalous magnetic moment, are applied to limit the model parameters, especially the @xmath1 coupling and the mass of the lightest cp-odd higgs boson.
4. The constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment are found to favor a light @xmath0 with large @xmath1 coupling and/or a light smuon in the type-ii 2hdm and the lepton-specific 2hdm.
5. The constraints from the branching ratios of @xmath1 decays into fermion pairs and the decay of @xmath0 into light higgs bosons are found to be more stringent in the type-ii 2hdm and the lepton-specific 2hdm, limiting the @xmath1 coupling and the mass of the lightest cp-odd higgs boson.
6. The branching ratios of the rare @xmath0 decays into light higgs bosons and into fermion pairs are calculated for the four models, with the type-ii 2hdm predicting the largest ratios for @xmath2 and @xmath3, and the l2hdm predicting the largest ratio for @xmath4.
7. The decay @xmath11, which depends on the higgs self interactions, is found to have a large branching ratio in the type-ii 2hdm, lepton-specific 2hdm, and nmssm, but not in the nmssm.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that predicts the existence of superpartners and solves the naturalness problem, potentially leading to gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale.
2. The no-scale khler potential scenario, where SUSY breaking is mediated by gaugino masses, is highly predictive and has been investigated in various models, including string theory and the sequestered sector scenario.
3. The no-scale khler potential scenario is flavor blind, suppressing contributions of SUSY particles to flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs).
4. The minimal SUSY breaking scenario, with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, is severely constrained by the cosmological bound and the LEP2 bound on muon pair production, leaving a very narrow allowed region for the SUSY breaking scale.
5. When the gaugino masses are above the GUT scale, the SUSY breaking scale can be as small as about 180 gev, allowing for potential discovery at the Tevatron Run 2, but the higgs mass bound and the @xmath0 constraint further constrain this scenario.
6. The higgsino-like SUSY breaking scenario, where stops are lighter than in the universal gaugino mass case, is not viable at the Tevatron Run 2 due to the higgs mass bound, but the wino-like and sneutrino-like SUSY breaking scenarios allow for lighter SUSY particles that could be detected at the Tevatron Run 2.

1. The paper investigates the stability of Cauchy horizons (ch) in spacetimes formed by colliding plane waves (cpw) with added test fields.
2. The Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos (cx) solution, which possesses a Cauchy horizon instead of a spacelike singularity, contrasts with the expected behavior of spacetimes formed by cpw, which typically result in spacelike singularities.
3. Yurtsever demonstrated that ch in cpw spacetimes is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and a linear perturbation analysis by cx also shows an analogous result.
4. The paper explores the effects of cross polarization and electromagnetic (em) fields on the nature of resulting singularities in cpw spacetimes.
5. The Bell-Szekeres (bs) solution, describing the collision of two linearly polarized em waves, forms a Cauchy horizon in the interaction region, which is shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation.
6. The paper introduces a cross-polarized version of the bs solution (cpbs) and examines the stability of its quasiregular (qr) singularities using various test fields.
7. The stability conjecture by Helliwell and Konkowski (hk) predicts that qr singularities will transform into scalar curvature (sc) singularities in the presence of generic waves.
8. The paper presents an exact back-reaction calculation for the collision of cross-polarized em field coupled with scalar field, confirming the hk stability conjecture and revealing the true nature of the singularity in the cpbs spacetime.

1. Deep X-ray surveys have extended to cosmologically interesting distances, revealing a significant number of normal galaxies among the X-ray sources, contributing as much as 510% of the X-ray background (XRB) flux in the 0.52 keV band.
2. The Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) survey has detected individual normal galaxies up to redshifts of z=1.2, corresponding to a look-back time of 1.6 billion years, allowing for the study of the X-ray response to past star formation rates.
3. The study focuses on spiral galaxies, using stacking techniques to estimate X-ray fluxes at faint levels and spectroscopic redshifts to ensure comparable optical luminosities across different redshifts.
4. The X-ray luminosity per unit @2-band luminosity of typical spiral galaxies has not evolved upward by more than a factor of 1.73 by z=1.2, suggesting that the X-ray luminosity of spiral galaxies has not increased substantially over this redshift range.

1. Quantum correlations can be classified into non-separable (entangled), separable, and bell-nonlocal states, with bell-nonlocal states demonstrating the violation of local causality.
2. EPR-steerability is a phenomenon where a quantum state allows for correlations that demonstrate EPR-steering, which is a special case of steering and only possible for a subset of non-separable states.
3. The quantum steering ellipsoid formalism is used to develop a deterministic local hidden variable (LHV) model for projective measurements on two-qubit states with maximally mixed reduced states, known as t-states.
4. A necessary condition for t-states to be EPR-steerable is derived via the steering ellipsoid, which is also conjectured to be sufficient for EPR-steerability.
5. Two sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability are derived, based on new and known EPR-steering inequalities for the spin covariance matrix.
6. The necessary condition for EPR-steerability is shown to be relatively strong and to coincide with the boundary of t-states satisfying the sufficient conditions in some parameter regions.
7. The paper concludes with a discussion of further work, including the extension of the analysis to arbitrary two-qubit states and the generalization of the LHV models to arbitrary projective measurements.

1. The concept of using a single electron's spin to encode binary information was first mentioned informally by Feynman around 1985, but concrete schemes for spintronic logic gates were not developed until the mid-1990s.
2. Encoding information in spin offers potential advantages such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and possibly faster operation since spin does not require charge transport.
3. A concrete scheme for a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed in 1994, with the spins' spin orientations representing binary variables.
4. The system's ground state favors anti-ferromagnetic ordering, with the spin polarization either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field.
5. The truth table of the proposed spintronic NAND gate was realized, but it faced challenges with input signals that could lead to metastable states and prevent proper logic signal propagation due to bidirectional exchange interaction.
6. A solution involving a three-phase clock was proposed to ensure unidirectional logic signal propagation, but it was not considered practical due to the need for precise gate potential control and significant energy dissipation.
7. In 1996, a logically and physically reversible quantum inverter using two exchange-coupled spins was devised, which could potentially bypass the Landauer barrier and offer lower energy dissipation.
8. The realization of a universal quantum gate using two exchange-coupled spins in quantum dots was also proposed, with the potential for using electron or nuclear spins for qubit encoding in solid-state systems.
9. Recent experimental progress in transferring electron spins between quantum dots and the ability to read spin states with circularly polarized light suggest that optical readout may be a more practical approach for solid-state qubits, avoiding the challenges of electrical readout.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries with a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary that fills its Roche lobe, transferring mass via the inner Lagrangian point. Theoretical models struggle to reproduce the observed orbital period distribution, particularly the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour range and the sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
2. Theoretical models suggest that the minimum orbital period occurs where the mass transfer time and thermal relaxation time are equal, but the exact position is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the rate of angular momentum (am) losses.
3. The authors investigate ways to increase the minimum period by increasing the mass transfer rate and to ""hide"" the period spike by introducing a spread of values in the CV population, specifically through consequential am loss (CAL), where am is lost as a result of mass transferred from the secondary.
4. The authors use a stellar code to calculate the long-term evolution of CVs, considering different CAL efficiencies and deformation factors of the secondary star. They find that even maximal CAL efficiency cannot increase the bounce period sufficiently, and that a large deformation factor is required to reach the observed minimum period.
5. The authors compare the observed period distribution with various synthesized model distributions, finding that none fit as well as a flat distribution. They conclude that the period spike problem remains unresolved, and that the period minimum problem may be an age limit rather than a bounce period.
6. The authors suggest that the period spike could be washed out by considering a spread of CAL efficiencies in the CV population, but note that this would still not account for the observed sharp cut-off at the minimum period.

1. The mid-infrared (mir) h@xmath5 emission in stephan s quintet (sq) is a dominant coolant over x-ray emission, challenging the traditional view that x-rays always dominate cooling in compact group evolution.
2. The mir h@xmath5 emission in sq is predominantly produced by shocks with velocities of 620 km/s and 2000 km/s, suggesting a multiphase postshock medium.
3. The h@xmath5 emission coexists with x-ray emission along the shock ridge, indicating that the h@xmath5 emission is not directly heated by x-rays but is a result of shock-induced reheating of the gas.
4. Star formation in sq is dominated by the regions sq-a and 7318b-south, located at the ends of the shock ridge, suggesting they are shock-triggered starbursts. However, regions dominated by warm h@xmath5 emission exhibit very low star formation rates, consistent with a turbulent model where h@xmath5 is significantly reheated.
5. The findings in sq provide evidence for a significant, albeit surprising, cooling mechanism in shock systems, which could be crucial in systems ranging from ultra-luminous infrared galaxies to radio galaxies to supernova remnants.

1. The short-lived radioisotope @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, suggesting it may have been injected into the solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
2. Initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity in the solar nebula could be reduced by marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disks, which mix and transport gas and small particles.
3. Stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the early solar nebula, potentially due to UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula.
4. MGU disks can transport small refractory particles from the inner to the outer solar nebula, explaining the presence of such particles in comet 81P/Wild 2.
5. MGU disks are likely involved in FU Orionis outbursts, which are believed to be triggered by a build-up of mass in the innermost disk, possibly due to a coupled mechanism of MGU and magnetorotational instability (MRI).
6. Numerical models using a three-dimensional gravitational hydrodynamics code were computed to examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity in disks of various sizes and protostar masses, with initial conditions representing either a single-shot injection or continuous injection of isotopic heterogeneity.
7. The models show that MGU disk evolution leads to rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains, homogenizing the isotopic distribution over time.
8. The initial location of the injection has little effect on the long-term evolution of the isotopic distribution, which is primarily determined by the underlying MGU disk evolution.
9. The results suggest that MGU disk phases are capable of relatively rapid large-scale mixing and transport, regardless of the stellar or disk mass, or the exact value of the @xmath2 stability parameter, with implications for the habitability of planetary systems around low- and intermediate-mass stars.

1. The current cosmological model, known as @xmath0cdm, is based on the friedmann - robertson - walker metric and includes cold dark matter ( dm) and a cosmological constant ( de) as the main components. However, the model faces theoretical challenges, such as the fine - tune coincidence problem and the discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant and its estimated value in particle physics.
2. To address these issues, interacting dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de) models have been proposed, where the interaction between the two components can alleviate the coincidence problem and potentially explain the observed value of the cosmological constant.
3. Observational evidence, including the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao), weak lensing ( wl), and supernova type Ia ( snia), supports the existence of an interaction between dm and de. The Planck collaboration's analysis of boss data also suggests a deviation from the @xmath0cdm model, which could be explained by an interacting dm / de model.
4. Current and future observational facilities, such as the South Pole Telescope ( spt), the WiggleZ De survey, the Euclid mission, and the Cosmic Origins Explorer ( core), aim to probe the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and their interactions by measuring the expansion history, growth of structure, and other cosmological parameters with increasing precision.

2. Population A sources have narrow broad emission lines, while Population B includes a mix of radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars with broader profiles.
3. Narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are considered reliable rest frame measures, except in ""blue outliers"" with weak [OIII] and large blueshifts.
4. Broad FeII emission has been found in Type 1 quasars, and its width appears to correlate with the broad emission line width ( fwhm h@xmath0) over a certain range.
5. A study claimed a systematic redshift of FeII relative to [OIII]5007 in a majority of Type 1 quasars, suggesting FeII emission arises in a region with dynamics dominated by infall at larger radii than the broad line region.
6. The authors questioned the existence of a systematic FeII redshift by analyzing a sample of the brightest SDSS DR5 quasars, finding no evidence for such a shift.
7. The study suggests that the accuracy of FeII shift measures depends on FeII strength, spectral signal-to-noise ratio (s/n), and the presence of HeII emission, which can affect the apparent redshift of the FeII blue blend.

2. Theoretical and experimental discrepancies in caloric curves are attributed to measurement precision and finite-size effects, with recent reevaluations of neutron kinetic energies suggesting a nonequilibrium component in the measured source excitation energies.
3. The microcanonical multifragmentation model is refined to include discrete energy levels for primary break-up and a modified level density formula for fragments with short excited state lifetimes, improving the model's adherence to microcanonical constraints.
4. The model now accounts for secondary particle emission, simulating the sequential evaporation process through a monte carlo approach, and includes both primary and secondary break-up stages.
5. The improved model reevaluates caloric curves and constant volume heat capacity functions, indicating a phase transition and identifying transition temperatures, with the model's predictions aligning well with recent experimental heli caloric curves.

The detection of extended water emission at 325 ghz and the mapping of the emission of h@xmath3o at this frequency provide much finer spatial resolution than iso or swas, and an estimate of the h@xmath3o abundance as accurate as that obtained from the extremely optically thick h@xmath3o lines observed in the submillimeter and far-infrared domains.

2. For one-band superconductors, the study finds that strong electron-phonon coupling and impurities can introduce extra nonlinearity at both low and high temperatures, with analytic formulas provided for strong coupling corrections.
3. In the two-band case, the study shows that nearly decoupled bands exhibit a strong signature of the small gap band in the nonlinear coefficients, but this signature disappears with increased interband coupling or scattering.
4. Intraband impurities in the small gap band can wash out the temperature variation of the nonlinear coefficient, while impurities in the larger gap band affect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures.

1. The recent discovery of a new particle at the LHC, consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson, has strengthened the Standard Model's validity, but anomalies like the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) suggest potential new physics.
2. The muon g-2 discrepancy, more than 3 sigma away from Standard Model predictions, hints at new physics, possibly involving a new gauge interaction for the muon.
3. The muon's mass and neutrino mass are determined by yukawa couplings, Majorana masses, and the Higgs boson's vacuum expectation value, with the seesaw mechanism explaining the lightness of neutrino masses.
4. A new gauge interaction could break lepton symmetry and potentially explain the muon g-2 anomaly without violating baryon asymmetry washout, which occurs if the interaction is efficient at temperatures above the electroweak scale.
5. To avoid baryon asymmetry washout, the new interaction must be inefficient at the electroweak scale, or the Majorana masses must be small.
6. If the Majorana masses are small, lepton symmetry is effectively conserved, and the weakest condition (small Majorana masses) is sufficient to prevent washout.
7. The new interaction must not close the universe through neutrino decay before baryogenesis, which requires the right-handed neutrinos to be long-lived and not decay before baryogenesis.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems exhibits unique properties and behaviors under decoherence, attracting significant research interest for quantum information processing.
2. Studies have shown that entanglement can be terminated suddenly (entanglement sudden death, esd) or revive after some time, even when qubit coherence degrades asymptotically.
3. The entanglement is not destroyed but can change location, being transferred to reservoirs under amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics.
4. Recent findings suggest that entanglement can be stably distributed among all bipartite subsystems if qubits and reservoirs form a bound state and non-markovian effects are significant.
5. The identity of the entanglement in the whole system is always satisfied, revealing the invariant nature of entanglement dynamics under decoherence.
6. The entanglement distribution among subsystems is influenced by the properties of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.
7. The entanglement can be preserved in the long-time limit if bound states between qubits and reservoirs are formed, contrary to the markovian approximation and decoherence-free double Jaynes-Cummings model.
8. The entanglement dynamics and its distributions in bipartite partitions are determined by the time-dependent excited-state population of the qubits.
9. The presence of bound states between qubits and reservoirs leads to population trapping, preventing complete entanglement transfer and resulting in stable entanglement distribution among subsystems.
10. These results have implications for quantum reservoir engineering, offering a method to protect entanglement from decoherence by modifying reservoir properties.

2. The paper aims to quantify the properties of shower partons and illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons, especially in the intermediate @xmath2 region of heavy-ion collisions.
3. The shower parton distributions (spd) are determined phenomenologically, using the fragmentation functions (ff) parameterized by fitting data from various processes.
4. The spd s are shown to be useful in problems where the knowledge of ff s alone is insufficient, such as the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet.

2. Regularization of calculations in discrete differential geometry is challenging, especially for the Hodge star and wedge product, which are essential for maintaining locality and the product rule.
3. Previous discrete schemes, such as those by Becher and Joos, Kanamori and Kawamoto, and Balachandran et al., have addressed these challenges with varying degrees of success.
4. Adams proposed a method using two parallel lattices to maintain locality of the Hodge star and a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product, which has been studied for its formal aspects.
5. The paper aims to apply this discrete differential geometry to the Dirac-Kähler formulation, focusing on chiral symmetry and exact flavor projection.
6. The discrete differential geometry is defined on a complex space comprising points, links, faces, volumes, and hyper-volumes, with each simplex having an associated cochain.
7. The Whitney and de Rham maps are introduced to define the wedge product between cochains and to discretize fields, respectively.
8. The discrete Hodge star and adjoint derivative are defined, and the Laplacian is expressed in terms of the Dirac-Kähler operator.
9. To implement exact chiral symmetry, the paper introduces a new de Rham map that aligns the domains of integration between the original and dual complexes.

2. It is argued that since a classical @xmath0-invariant field cannot distinguish between different CFS locally, maintaining @xmath0 invariance during quantization could lead to simpler quantum structures.
3. The paper utilizes Dirac's six-cone formalism to represent all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space, with the metric inherited from Minkowski space.
4. The authors introduce auxiliary fields and employ the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to handle gauge freedom and ensure the retention of the @xmath0 invariance throughout the quantization process.
5. They derive a set of Wightman two-point functions for the Maxwell and auxiliary fields, showing that these functions are related to their Minkowski counterparts.

The analysis of the high energy emission by the _ Fermi_-lat instrument in grb 090510, in conjunction with the excellent data obtained by the _ Swift_ and _ AGILE_ satellites, allows the identification of a precise sequence of different astrophysical events, illustrating the formation of a black hole (bh).
2. Grb 090510 is classified as a short gamma-ray burst (s-grb) originating from a binary neutron star (ns) merger, a scenario different from the single-event model traditionally associated with long gamma-ray bursts (long-grbs).
3. The fireshell theory, which describes the formation of a kerr-newman bh through a gravitational collapse, is applied to interpret the data of grb 090510, revealing a sequence of events: the prompt gamma-ray burst (p-grb), the prompt emission, and the high-energy (gev) emission linked to the bh formation.
4. The p-grb emission is interpreted as a convolution of thermal spectra originating from a dyadotorus, an axially symmetric configuration of the @xmath0-baryon plasma, which is formed during the fireshell evolution.
5. The prompt emission is modeled as the result of collisions between the accelerated baryons and the clumpy circumstellar medium (cbm), revealing the structure of the cbm and an average density of @xmath18.
6. The gev emission, delayed with respect to the p-grb, is interpreted as the result of accretion of matter onto the newly-born bh, requiring a high angular momentum and a beaming effect to fulfill the energy requirement.
7. The cosmological redshift of grb 090510 is estimated to be @xmath2, in excellent agreement with the spectroscopically measured value.

1. The renormalization of models with new physics at tree level often requires extra input parameters beyond those of the standard model ( sm ) , which can lead to incorrect predictions when the new physics does not decouple from the sm at one-loop.
2. The triplet model and the minimal left-right symmetric model are two examples where the new physics does not decouple from the sm at one-loop, necessitating a fourth input parameter in a consistent renormalization scheme.
3. In these models, the @xmath0 dependence in the radiative corrections to the @xmath1 mass becomes logarithmic, contrary to the quadratic dependence in the sm.
4. The non-decoupling property of the triplet higgs is demonstrated by showing that the scalar contributions to the @xmath1 mass depend quadratically on the scalar masses, and that the triplet higgs field must acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) even if it is very small.
5. The presence of the triplet higgs changes the @xmath4 dependence in the @xmath1 mass, allowing a heavier neutral higgs boson to be consistent with the experimental @xmath1 mass measurement.
6. The results highlight the importance of correctly performing the renormalization according to the electroweak structure of the new models, and demonstrate that the non-decoupling effect has been overlooked in previous analyses of the littlest higgs model.

3. The map from a log-Riemann surface to the Riemann sphere is of finite degree, and near a ramification point, it is equivalent to a map from a punctured disc or a half-plane.
4. The spaces of germs of meromorphic functions and 1-forms with exponential singularities at a ramification point are defined, and they only depend on the equivalence class of the singularity.
5. Uniformization theorems for log-Riemann surfaces of finite type imply that the map near a puncture is given by a meromorphic function with poles of a specific order.
6. The spaces of meromorphic functions and 1-forms with exponential singularities at a puncture form a pairing, which is nondegenerate.
7. An exp-algebraic curve is defined as an equivalence class of log-Riemann surface structures of finite type, and it corresponds to a degree zero line bundle on the compact riemann surface with a meromorphic connection.
8. The spaces of meromorphic functions and 1-forms with exponential singularities on an exp-algebraic curve are non-zero and isomorphic to the spaces of meromorphic sections of the line bundle and meromorphic @xmath0-valued 1-forms, respectively.

2. The approach is based on the rational representation of the self-energy, with constraints derived from the Hartree-Fock limit, zero-frequency value, quasiparticle mass renormalization, positions of Hubbard bands, and the value of the self-energy at zero frequency.
3. The sbmf method provides a good approximation for the quasiparticle residue and the self-energy at zero frequency, while the Hubbard i method fails in several regimes.

2. The research employs mean-field approximations and monte carlo simulations to determine the phase diagram and the transition lines as functions of the concentration of inert sites. It is found that the transition between active and o-poisoned states becomes continuous at a critical concentration of inert sites, which is identified through hysteresis loop analysis.
3. The results indicate that the presence of inert sites reduces the production rate of the desired product, @xmath2 molecules, and that the maximum production rate occurs at the first-order transition, regardless of the concentration of inert sites. The simulations confirm that the nature of the transition changes from first-order to continuous as the concentration of inert sites increases beyond the critical value.

2. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional defined on the space of smooth maps between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, characterized by the vanishing of the trace of the second fundamental form.
3. The energy density of a map is a smooth function defined by a specific formula involving the volume measure and the pullback metric.
4. The tension field of a map is a symmetric map defined by a specific formula involving the Levi-Civita connections, and a map is harmonic if its tension field vanishes identically.
5. The index of a harmonic map is the dimension of the largest subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite, determining whether the map is stable or unstable.
6. The paper focuses on harmonic maps between almost para-Hermitian and almost paracontact metric manifolds, with applications in various fields such as computational fluid dynamics, string theory, and quantum field theory.
7. The paper introduces the concepts of paraholomorphic and parapluriharmonic maps, which are generalizations of holomorphic and pluriharmonic maps in complex geometry.
8. The main theorem establishes that a smooth map between para-Sasakian manifolds is @xmath0-paraholomorphic if and only if its tension field lies in a certain subspace, making it harmonic.

The sample includes 313 agn, with a focus on the correlation between the FIR SEDs and the X-ray luminosity as a proxy for the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity.
2. The analysis reveals that the FIR SEDs of the agn host galaxies are not strongly correlated with the X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the SMBH activity does not significantly affect the FIR SEDs. However, a weak correlation is observed between the FIR SEDs and the Seyfert type (Sy1 vs. Sy2), with Sy1 galaxies showing a slightly stronger correlation at shorter wavelengths (250 and 350 micrometers).
3. Anomalous FIR SEDs are identified for six agn, which are dominated by synchrotron emission from radio jets rather than thermally heated dust. These galaxies are well correlated with the X-ray luminosity and the 3.4/4.6 micrometer SPIRE flux ratio, suggesting a possible connection to the radio loudness of the agn. The study concludes that the FIR SEDs of agn host galaxies are likely dominated by cold dust heated by stellar radiation, similar to normal star-forming galaxies, and that the SMBH activity does not significantly contribute to the FIR SEDs.

4. The technique generates sub-Doppler peaks, or Lamb-Bennett dips, in the absorption spectra, which are indicative of atomic resonances with sidebands.
5. Theoretical modeling uses a three-level ladder system interacting with two lasers, one amplitude-modulated and the other frequency-modulated, to simulate the experimental setup.
6. The method is demonstrated using two ladder systems, with the first using amplitude-modulated probe lasers and the second using frequency-modulated pump lasers.
7. The MTS technique allows for the locking of the probe laser frequency to an excited atomic resonance, improving signal-to-noise ratio and eliminating unwanted modulation effects.
8. The method has been applied to measure hyperfine splittings in the @xmath0rb level of rubidium, with results in good agreement with relativistic many-body perturbation theory calculations.
9. The MTS technique shows promise for further advancing precision studies of atomic properties in excited states and stimulating theoretical work in this area.

1. The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has attracted attention due to its ability to provide direct observations of quantum numbers and masses of particles produced in the central exclusive production (CEP) process, where a large rapidity gap separates the intact protons from the outgoing protons.
2. The fp420 collaboration has proposed installing detectors at approximately 420 m and 220 m from the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments, respectively, to detect protons and extend the accessible mass range beyond 100 GeV.
3. Simulations show that the acceptance of the detectors for events with a 120 GeV Higgs boson is independent of the distance from the beam up to about 7 mm for detectors at 420 m, but it increases significantly for asymmetric tagging scenarios.
4. The cross section for the CEP of a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks is predicted to be between 1.86 and 7.38 fb, depending on the parton distribution function used, and is sensitive to the soft survival factor.
5. The analysis predicts that the CEP of the lightest scalar Higgs boson in the @xmath0 scenario of the MSSM can be observed with a significance of at least 1 in the @xmath13 decay channel within 3 years of LHC data taking, assuming a CEP cross section greater than 30 fb and a Higgs width not much larger than the detector resolution.

2. The Hall conductivity and power dissipation are influenced by the asymmetric angular response of vortex-antivortex pairs to an oscillating external field, leading to nonzero Hall conductivity and sign changes in the conductivity near the KT transition.

1. The orion dwarf galaxy, with its well-understood baryonic matter distribution and significant mass discrepancy, serves as a critical test for the nature of dark matter (DM) and the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) formalism.
2. Recent observations provide a high-resolution rotation curve (RC) for the orion dwarf, showing a steep and constant velocity profile indicative of a DM-dominated gravitational potential.
3. The galaxy's kinematics are well-suited for testing the MOND formalism, which posits a transition from Newtonian to modified dynamics at low accelerations, but has been challenged by discrepancies in spiral galaxy rotation curves.
4. The orion dwarf's RC is best modeled by a dark matter halo with a constant density core (urch), rather than the Navarro-Frenk-White (nfw) profile typically resulting from cold dark matter simulations.
5. The MOND model fails to reproduce the observed RC unless significant adjustments are made to the galaxy's distance and/or gas mass, suggesting that the orion dwarf's kinematics cannot be explained by baryonic matter alone.
6. The orion dwarf's RC, when modeled with a cored DM halo, aligns well with observations, supporting the empirical finding that spiral galaxy rotation curves are best described by a cored profile rather than a cuspy one.
7. The orion dwarf's characteristics make it an ideal candidate for further detailed studies, including direct distance measurements, to test the MOND formalism and the nature of dark matter.

2. Studies show that galaxy environment is independent of surface brightness and concentration at fixed color and luminosity, suggesting color and luminosity measures of star formation history have a more fundamental relationship with environment.
3. The dependence of galaxy properties on environment does not appear to be related to the large scale density field, indicating that only the masses of the host halos of galaxies strongly affect their properties.
4. Our analysis demonstrates that the environments of low luminosity, red galaxies continue to become denser as absolute magnitude decreases, extending the relationship found by previous studies towards lower luminosities.

2. The study presents a new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the half-filled Hubbard model's ground state, using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
3. The method is applicable across the entire range of interaction strength and illustrated with three cases: the pure model in two and three dimensions, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-@xmath0 impurities in three dimensions.
4. The method for obtaining quantum correction to sublattice magnetization solely in terms of transverse spin correlations is parallel to the spin-wave theory approach and differs from methods involving self-energy corrections.
5. The RPA approach has been shown to interpolate between weak and strong coupling limits and to yield identical results for all quantum corrections as from the spin-wave theory for the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet (QHAF).
6. The method involves a convenient way to perform the frequency integral to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators, and it is illustrated for transverse spin correlations in the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model.
7. The study concludes that the quantum spin-fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization is sharply enhanced by spin vacancies but strongly suppressed by low-@xmath0 impurities, with the overall effect depending on the relative magnitude of the coefficients and the impurity concentration.

1. The paper presents a model extension of the Higgs triplet model (HTM) that naturally incorporates a dark matter (DM) candidate and explains the smallness of neutrino masses without heavy triplet fields. The model introduces a @xmath0-odd scalar field @xmath1 to generate the @xmath2-term at the one-loop level, which suppresses the @xmath3-term responsible for neutrino masses.
2. The DM candidate in the model is an @xmath4 scalar field, which is electrically neutral and odd under an unbroken @xmath5 symmetry. The model's predictions for lepton flavor violation (LFV) processes remain unchanged from the HTM, and the DM candidate is stable due to the @xmath6 parity.
3. The model's phenomenological implications include a suppressed @xmath7-term at the one-loop level, allowing for light neutrino masses and a viable DM candidate. Collider signatures are discussed, and the model's compatibility with existing experimental constraints is examined, including the relic density of DM and constraints from neutrino oscillation data.

3. The electron anomaly has been measured with high precision, surpassing the precision on the fine-structure constant, and has been used to refine the value of the fine-structure constant.
4. The muon anomaly, with a sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections, could indicate new physics at the TeV scale, such as lepton substructure, anomalous couplings, or supersymmetry.
5. The Cern experiment observed a contribution from hadronic vacuum polarization, which is challenging to calculate directly from QCD due to low energy scales.
6. The strong interaction contribution to the magnetic moment is taken from theoretical references, and the hadronic contribution is expected to set a limit on the precision of the standard model value.

2. The reactive coupling originates from the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator and phase-dependent gradient forces.
3. The paper explores the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields, focusing on reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting, unlike previous works that only considered dispersive coupling.
4. The system's Hamiltonian and time evolutions of the expectation values are introduced, and the expectation value of the output fields is calculated.
5. The nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are obtained, and the system's behavior is analyzed for different pump powers.
6. It is found that without reactive coupling, there is no normal mode splitting in the output fields, but with reactive coupling, normal mode splitting occurs, and the peak separation increases with increasing pump power.
7. The reactive coupling can also cause four-wave mixing, leading to the generation of an anti-Stokes field.

3. The transverse magnetization exhibits oscillatory behavior with an envelope that decays algebraically over time.
4. Despite the oscillations and decay, the magnetization does not become homogeneous due to the presence of odd-occupation states with zero energy.
5. The decay exponent of the envelope is independent of the external transverse field, indicating a lack of thermalization.

3. The color superconducting phase is unstable with respect to particle-particle Cooper-pair condensate formation in momentum space due to a weak attractive interaction in a cold Fermi sea.

5. The gapless color superconducting phases resemble the unstable sarma state and are thermal stable under a natural charge neutrality condition.

7. A charge neutral loff state may not cure the instability of off-diagonal gluons, but a gluon condensate state can.
8. Increasing mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks induces spontaneous generation of Nambu-Goldstone currents, covering the gluon phase and the one-plane wave loff state.

2. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHY) theory distinguishes two continuous transitions during the solid-to-liquid transformation, mediated by the unbinding of dislocation pairs and point defects, and is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
3. However, the KTHY theory's assumption of a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects contradicts experimental observations of aligned and accumulated dislocations.
4. Numerical studies have reported various phase transitions in 2D systems, with a trend towards supporting the KTHY theory as computational power increased, but equilibration issues may have led to misleading conclusions.
5. Our study identifies three stages of relaxation in microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations: (1) velocity distribution approaches equilibrium within a few plasma oscillation cycles, (2) configurational temperature relaxes at longer timescales, and (3) long-range correlations require significantly longer equilibration times, which are size-dependent.
6. The observed hexatic phase in short simulations may be a result of kinetic bottlenecks, and larger systems may equilibrate faster, leading to misleading conclusions about the true equilibrium state.

However, the Kepler pipeline assumes all host stars are single, which may introduce systematic uncertainties in planetary radii and occurrence rates if some stars are actually multiple stars.
2. The study explores the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. It is found that, without spectroscopic or high-resolution imaging observations to vet companions, the planetary radii are systematically underestimated. If a star is observed with high-resolution imaging or radial velocity spectroscopy, the underestimate of the true planet radius is significantly reduced.
3. The presence of stellar companions can affect the determination of occurrence rates for earth-sized, super-Earth/mini-Neptune-sized, and Neptune-sized planets. If all Kepler objects of interest are assumed to be single stars without companion vetting, the fraction of earth-sized planets may be overestimated by up to 20%, and the fraction of large planets may be underestimated by up to 30%. However, if all Kepler objects undergo vetting with radial velocity and high-resolution imaging, the uncertainties in occurrence rates are reduced significantly.

2. The onset of stellar winds and supernovae explosions can rapidly expel gas from clusters, leaving them out of equilibrium and significantly altering their structure.
3. Observational studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (imf) of clusters by assuming they are in virial equilibrium, but results have been inconsistent, with some suggesting non-standard imfs and others reporting standard imfs.
4. Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard imfs, suggesting that the youngest clusters may not be in virial equilibrium.
5. The present work examines the luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters (m82-f, ngc 1569-a, and ngc 1705-1) in nearby starburst galaxies, which show excess light at large radii, indicating they are likely not in dynamical equilibrium.
6. The clusters' excess light at large radii is modeled using @xmath0-body simulations, which show that rapid gas expulsion followed by violent relaxation can produce the observed profiles, suggesting the clusters are not in virial equilibrium.
7. The simulations suggest that clusters with a star formation efficiency of around 40-50% are likely to display the observed excess light, indicating they are not in virial equilibrium.
8. The excess light at large radii in young clusters may be a signature of violent relaxation and could explain the observed discrepancies in imf studies, as these clusters are not in virial equilibrium as assumed.
9. The findings support the hypothesis of ""infant mortality,"" where many young clusters are destroyed or dissolve rapidly due to gas expulsion, and suggest that the observed excess of young clusters in extragalactic clusters may be due to a population of short-lived unbound clusters.

3. The coherent motion is characterized by a semiquantal picture, while the irregular motion resembles stochastic dynamics.
4. The tunneling period decreases with increasing perturbation strength within the coherent motion regime, which can be explained by the appearance of a stochastic layer near the separatrix.
5. In the irregular motion phase, the uncertainty product initially increases and saturates due to quantum interference, contrasting with the unbounded growth in the stochastic perturbation case.
6. Quantum fluctuations are larger for classically chaotic trajectories compared to regular ones, indicating that quantum corrections to phase space fluctuations are more significant for chaotic dynamics.
7. In the semiquantal approximation, partial quantum fluctuations enhance chaotic behavior, while chaos enhances tunneling and decoherence.
8. The semiquantal picture breaks down for chaos-induced delocalized states, and the full quantum interference suppresses the chaotic behavior.
9. The study suggests that the classical chaos enhances the tunneling rate, which can be explained by the chaos-assisted instanton tunneling theory.

6. The modified Planck quantities are significant in the context of cosmology, as they affect the early universe's main physical quantities, such as the inflaton mass, which in turn influences the density fluctuations during inflation.
7. The dimensionless entropy enclosed in the cosmological horizon at the Planck time remains unchanged, indicating that the information content of the universe at the Planck time is preserved despite quantum gravity effects.
8. The quantum gravity corrections at the Planck time could potentially be observed through the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by future CMB experiments.
9. The study of quantum gravity effects at the Planck time provides insights into the transition from the quantum gravitational regime to the classical regime and has implications for understanding the early universe and the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.

1. The paper explores new methods to compute the couplings in conformal field theories (CFTs), focusing on scalar primary operators in @xmath0 su(N) @xmath1 symmetry.
2. It introduces a method to compute couplings by deforming the CFT with a marginal or irrelevant operator @xmath0, which introduces new divergences in the renormalized operators of the critical theory.
3. The deformation parameter @xmath2 is related to the anomalous dimension matrix, and the couplings @xmath1 can be computed by analyzing the action of this matrix on operators diagonalized by the Bethe ansatz.
4. The paper demonstrates the method for the @xmath3 deformation of @xmath4 su(N) @xmath1 symmetry, using integrability to diagonalize the anomalous dimension matrix.
5. The authors also extend the computation to the case of a 3-point function with an additional chiral operator, using the ads/cft duality to compute the string partition function.

1. The study presents an adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics over arbitrary networks, deriving a lower bound on the epidemic threshold in terms of the network topology and model parameters. For homogeneous dynamics, this lower bound is proportional to the threshold in the standard sis model over static networks. An optimization framework is proposed to find cost-optimal adaptation rates to eradicate epidemics, confirmed by numerical simulations and compared with network centralities.
2. The paper also introduces a geometric program to solve the optimization problem for tuning adaptation rates, demonstrating its computational efficiency and the tightness of the theoretical lower bound with simulations. The relationship between optimal investment and centrality measures is analyzed, revealing that degree-based and eigenvector-based centralities are effective for determining investment in tuning cutting rates.

1. Open dielectric resonators have been extensively studied for various applications, and semiclassical methods have been used to understand their wave dynamics.
2. A trace formula relating the density of states of a quantum system to the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system has been developed for two-dimensional dielectric resonators.
3. The trace formula has been tested experimentally for two-dimensional resonators, but there has been no investigation of the trace formula for three-dimensional dielectric resonators due to the complexity of solving the full three-dimensional Maxwell equations.
4. The paper aims to compare experimental length spectra of three-dimensional dielectric resonators with the trace formula computed within a two-dimensional approximation using an effective index of refraction.
5. The experiments were conducted with two circular teflon microwave resonators, and the frequency spectra were measured using a vectorial network analyzer.
6. The effective index of refraction was found to vary with frequency, and the semiclassical trace formula was applied to the flat three-dimensional resonators using this frequency-dependent index.
7. The experimental length spectra showed good agreement with the trace formula, but the peak positions deviated slightly from the geometrical lengths of the periodic orbits.
8. The deviations were attributed to the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and a systematic error in the two-dimensional approximation.
9. The paper concludes that the trace formula needs to be improved for periodic orbits close to the critical angle and that the systematic error of the effective index of refraction approximation can be estimated and corrected for accurate predictions of the length spectra.

The merger of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star are significant sources of gravitational waves ( GW), with the inspiral phase of double neutron star ( NS-NS) mergers being of particular interest due to the energy released and the frequency range covered by ground-based interferometers.
2. Using a revised estimate of the NS-NS merging rate that includes the contribution of elliptical galaxies and the galactic star formation history, predictions for GW detection rates by initial LIGO and Virgo are one event every 125 and 148 years, respectively, and up to six detections per year in advanced configurations.
3. Numerical simulations based on monte carlo methods estimate the gravitational wave background spectrum produced by NS-NS coalescences, revealing a continuous background formed by events beyond a critical redshift, with a maximum around 670 Hz for the higher star formation rate ( sfr2 ) and 630 Hz for the lower sfr1.
4. The continuous background is out of reach for the first and second generation of interferometers, but the planned sensitivity of third-generation detectors like the large scale cryogenic gravitational wave telescope ( LCGT) could detect it, while the popcorn noise contribution is one order of magnitude higher and detectable with new data analysis techniques.

3. The research identifies critical behavior in the shock acceleration process, characterized by the appearance of multiple solutions, which may suggest that the shock system self-regulates to a critical point.

It specifically examines three viable @xmath0 models: the power-law, exponential, and square-root exponential models.
2. The constraints from BBN calculations indicate that the power-law model with an exponent of @xmath1 satisfies the BBN bounds, aligning with observational data. However, the exponential and square-root exponential models, for realistic parameter ranges, always satisfy the BBN bounds, suggesting that BBN cannot impose strict constraints on their parameters.

1. The paper presents an optimal mode selection and power allocation policy for a three-node half-duplex bidirectional relay network with fading links, aiming to maximize the sum rate.
2. The network consists of two users and a relay node, with no direct link between users and the ability to transmit and receive in different modes: point-to-point, multiple access, and broadcast.
3. The proposed protocol utilizes instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and long-term statistics to adaptively select the optimal transmission mode and allocate optimal powers to the nodes in each time slot, unlike existing protocols that do not consider power allocation or only select from two point-to-point modes.
4. The optimization problem formulated for the protocol considers the instantaneous CSI, the total average power constraint, and the power non-negativity constraint, resulting in a unique sum rate and optimal solution.
5. Simulation results confirm that the proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols, with significant gains over the traditional two-way relaying protocol and the time division broadcast (TDB) protocol without power allocation.
6. The paper also notes that the advantages of buffering come at the expense of increased end-to-end delay, which can be bounded with some modifications to the protocol, but the delay analysis is beyond the scope of the current work.

1. The acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination can serve as a standard ruler to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe, provided the cosmic microwave background (CMB) accurately reflects the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
2. Misinterpretations of the CMB due to undetected relativistic particles would not bias inferences about dark energy from low-redshift applications, as only the ratio of radiation to matter densities matters for the acoustic oscillations.
3. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave travels from the end of inflation to recombination, depends only on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma, and is robustly measured in the CMB.
4. The epoch of recombination is insensitive to cosmological models, and the redshift of equality is well constrained, allowing for accurate determination of the sound horizon.
5. The baryon-to-photon ratio is precisely measured in the CMB, and even small errors in this ratio have minimal impact on the sound horizon calculation.
6. The acoustic peak method, which relies on measuring the sound horizon, is robust against uncertainties in the matter density, as long as the redshift of equality is accurately determined.
7. Low-redshift measurements of the acoustic oscillation scale can constrain cosmological parameters, and the Hubble constant is the only parameter that would be affected by misinterpretations of the CMB.
8. The CMB can also constrain the actual densities of matter and radiation, revealing the presence of unknown relativistic species or unexpected evolution.

2. The LC spacetime describes a flat spacetime generated by an infinite line mass with mass per unit length @xmath0, but it also allows for interior solutions with @xmath1.
3. The LC spacetime lacks circular test particle orbits for @xmath2, leading to the interpretation that LC represents the field of a cylinder with radius increasing with @xmath0, which tends to infinity as @xmath0 approaches @xmath11.
4. The LC spacetime has no horizons, suggesting an upper limit to the mass per unit length of line sources, below which horizons are expected to form.
5. The anisotropic fluid matched to LC has an effective mass per unit length that reaches a maximum at @xmath20, potentially explaining the absence of horizons.
6. The LC spacetime with @xmath14, which possesses plane symmetry, has been interpreted as the gravitational field produced by an infinite sheet of negative mass density, but this interpretation raises questions about the asymmetry between positive and negative mass cases.

2. The estimation problem involves determining the parameters that describe a quantum channel, which is a completely positive linear map transforming density operators.
3. The estimation process typically involves preparing a set of quantum states, sending them through the channel, and performing measurements to infer the channel's parameters.
4. Two cost functions are introduced to quantify the quality of channel estimation protocols: statistical error and fidelity mean error, which are independent of the channel's parametrization.
5. Protocols for estimating the parameters of one-parameter quantum channels, such as depolarizing, phase damping, and amplitude damping channels, are investigated, showing that entanglement can enhance estimation quality.
6. For the general quantum channel, a protocol involving the preparation of multiple sets of qubits and measurements along different axes is proposed, with the statistical error and fidelity mean error as cost functions.
7. The use of entangled qubit pairs in estimation protocols is shown to be superior to using single qubits, particularly for estimating the parameters of the Pauli channel.
8. The estimation of higher-dimensional quantum channels, such as generalized Pauli channels, can also benefit from entanglement, as it allows for the design of states that satisfy specific conditions for optimal estimation.

2. The findings challenge the conventional understanding of centrality in high-energy collisions, suggesting that the event-wise depth of penetration on momentum fraction @xmath3 of the projectile wave function may be a more relevant factor than impact parameter. The study also questions the UE concept, as minimum-bias (MB) dijet contributions are observed in the transverse region traditionally excluded from UE studies.
3. The study's results have significant implications for claims of collectivity (flows) in small collision systems, as the observed same-side ""ridge"" in 7 TeV collisions is attributed to the interplay of the jet-related away-side 1d peak and the NJ quadrupole, rather than a hydro phenomenon. The study concludes that the NJ quadrupole trend is inconsistent with an initial-state eccentricity determined by impact parameter, further undermining the concept of centrality in high-energy collisions.

It demonstrates that any Lindblad evolution with self-adjoint Lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution, providing a unified mathematical framework for both regimes.
2. The approach not only allows for the derivation of Lindblad equations but also generalizes existing intrinsic decoherence models and can be applied to solve specific quantum systems like the phase-damped Jaynes-Cummings model. The method's versatility extends to proposing new physical interpretations for decoherence effects, potentially intrinsic to the system, without invoking environmental interactions.

2. Disorder is introduced by randomly shifting layer boundaries while maintaining the same refraction indices.
3. Two types of stacks are analyzed: homogeneous stacks (h) with positive refraction indices and mixed stacks (m) with alternating left- and right-handed materials.
4. The localization length in homogeneous stacks shows a quadratic dependence on wavelength at long wavelengths and saturates at low wavelengths, with saturation proportional to the inverse of the reflection coefficient between layers.
5. In mixed stacks, for low disorder and wavelengths much larger than the grating period, the localization length linearly depends on wavelength, with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between layers.
6. The localization length in both stack types is modulated by the presence of allowed and forbidden bands, with modulation decreasing as disorder increases.
7. For non-symmetric band distributions, the localization length presents an irregular form in the transmission spectrum, with more pronounced changes in mixed stacks.
8. The study provides a practical expression for the localization length in terms of wavelength, disorder, and reflection coefficient, valid for a wide range of parameters.

2. The model considers PAs with a characteristic microscopic length and a range of excess charges, with the behavior strongly influenced by the range of coulomb interactions.
3. For high dimensions, PAs behave similarly to random chains with short-range interactions, collapsing into dense states at low temperatures due to condensation energy.
4. In lower dimensions, the spatial conformations of PAs with excess charge strongly depend on the charge, with a critical charge determining the transition from compact to stretched states.
5. The study provides detailed results on the energetics and spatial conformations of short PAs, supporting previous Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and offering new insights into the system's behavior.
6. The ground state energies of PAs are found to be relatively insensitive to the sequence details, with the overall charge playing a significant role.
7. The study finds that PAs with small excess charge may undergo a phase transition between two dense states, which is not detectable in MC simulations due to low-temperature constraints.

2. The bimodal behavior originates from the curvature fluctuations near the clamped end of the chain, which are controlled by the bending energy.
3. For very short chains, the distribution function resembles a Gaussian with a maximum at a finite transverse displacement, interpreted as a remnant of the Gaussian behavior of short chains.
4. As the chain length increases, the curvature fluctuations become less controlled by the bending energy, leading to a weakening of the bimodality.
5. The onset of bimodality in the transverse distribution function is similar for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional chains when measured in units of contour length.
6. The distribution function becomes Gaussian for very short and very long chains, with the maximum at the onset of bimodality being a small effect in three dimensions.
7. The analytical results for short and long wormlike chains are in complete agreement with previous studies using different methods.

The cosmic ray spectrum is featureless and decreases as the cube of the primary energy, but high-energy tails above a few tens of gev require techniques that utilize extensive air showers developed in the atmosphere.
2. The high-energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum presents a challenge to theory, with no clear evidence of anisotropy and no observed cutoff in the spectrum. The composition of these cosmic rays is crucial for understanding their origin, as it could indicate whether they are accelerated locally or decay products of other particles.
3. Recent studies combining data from five different experiments have suggested a change in the spectral slope just above 2 @xmath2ev, and a shift towards lighter element composition at higher energies. However, the lack of anisotropy and the absence of a GZK cutoff in the observed spectrum complicate the puzzle.

By analyzing the muon density patterns in inclined showers, researchers have established that the muon distributions are universal and can be used to infer the primary particle composition. This technique has revealed new events with energies above 600 ev and provides a robust bound on the photon composition at ultra-high energies, suggesting that the photon component of the integral spectrum above 4 @xmath3ev is less than 10% at the 90% confidence level.

The study introduces two-dimensional plaquettes as fundamental building blocks for the construction of @xmath0-symmetric two-dimensional lattices, extending the concept of one-dimensional @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear oligomers. Four basic types of plaquettes are proposed, including configurations with four and five sites. The analysis focuses on stationary states that can be found analytically, while their stability against small perturbations is examined numerically.
2. The results reveal the existence of solution branches that terminate at the critical points of the respective linear @xmath0-symmetric systems, as well as branches that continue past these points due to nonlinearity. The spectral stability of the configurations is analyzed, showing that most stationary modes are unstable, although some stable branches are identified. The perturbed dynamics of the modes demonstrate that unstable ones typically lead to the growth of amplitudes at gain-carrying sites and decay at lossy ones, with passive sites potentially being driven towards growth or decay. The study suggests further exploration of more sophisticated stationary modes resulting from symmetry breaking and the potential existence of isolated solutions in @xmath0-symmetric systems.

1. The cataclysmic variable HU Aqr consists of a white dwarf accreting from a companion star, and is orbited by two planets, which have led to various explanations for observed variations in the system.
2. Detailed timing analysis suggests the planets are real, but the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on long timescales, yet some simulations show long-term stability.
3. The presence of planets around HU Aqr offers a unique opportunity to constrain the evolution of the system, as planets are expected to be rare in such turbulent environments.
4. The inner planet's orbit allows for the determination of the rate of mass loss during the common envelope phase, while the outer planet's orbit provides additional constraints on the initial conditions of the binary system.
5. By reconstructing the binary's evolution, the study derives initial conditions such as primary mass, secondary mass, and orbital separations, and measures the rate of mass loss in the common envelope.
6. The study's findings are consistent with previous common - envelope studies and provide insights into the evolution of cataclysmic variables and the conditions under which they form planetary systems.

1. The preparation of thin films of b20 type MnGe on silicon substrates has shown promise for future spintronic devices due to their interesting magnetic phases and ease of device integration.
2. The main challenge is the low magnetic ordering temperature of MnGe, which is below liquid nitrogen temperature, prompting the search for compounds with similar spin order at higher temperatures.
3. MnGe is a suitable candidate with a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure, which is expected to be stable at higher temperatures.
4. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been used to grow MnGe thin films on Si(111) substrates, utilizing a MnSi seedlayer to achieve the b20 crystal structure necessary for MnGe growth.
5. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations reveal that MnGe films consist of island growth with a flat surface, and the b20 structure is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
6. Magnetization measurements indicate that MnGe thin films exhibit antiferromagnetic behavior with an enhanced ordering temperature of 200K, and the helical structure is more rigid than in MnSi.
7. Resistivity measurements show that MnGe thin films are metallic with a residual resistivity of 83 cm at 3K, and the magnetoresistivity effect is negative without notable features in the investigated field range.

1. The core entropy of a quadratic polynomial maps the Julia set to a finite topological tree called the Hubbard tree, and is defined as the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to this tree.
2. The main goal of the paper is to prove that the core entropy function extends continuously from the Mandelbrot set to the complex plane.
3. The paper introduces an algorithm to compute the core entropy for rational angles by considering pairs of postcritical angles, avoiding the need to know the topology of the Hubbard tree.
4. The algorithm constructs a directed graph with countably many vertices, where vertices represent pairs of postcritical angles, and edges represent transitions between these angles.
5. The growth rate of the graph is defined as the exponential growth rate of the number of closed paths of a given length, and is related to the smallest zero of a function constructed by counting multi-cycles in the graph.
6. The paper proves that the growth rate of the graph varies continuously with the external angle, and coincides with the core entropy for rational angles.
7. The paper develops combinatorial tools to deal with growth rates of countable graphs, including the definition of bounded cycles and the introduction of labeled wedges.
8. The paper shows that the growth rate of a graph with bounded cycles equals the inverse of the smallest positive root of a function related to the spectral determinant of the graph.

The existence of failed gamma-ray bursts (fgrbs) with Lorentz factors much less than 100 but still greater than unity is likely due to the baryon-rich environment in popular progenitor models, leading to many such events that could be mistaken for orphan afterglows from highly collimated jetted gamma-ray bursts (grbs).
2. Distinguishing between orphan afterglows from fgrbs and jetted grbs is challenging due to uncertainties in trigger time and the similarity in early afterglow light curves.

2. The model demonstrates that, in the non-interacting regime, a resonance energy exists where the structured impurity is transparent, and states around this energy are delocalized, independent of the system's dimensionality.
3. The study extends the analysis to weakly interacting Bose gases confined on a 2D square lattice, showing that the 2d-DRDM drives the homogeneity of the ground state and induces non-monotonic behavior in the condensate fraction as a function of disorder strength, with enhancement near the resonance energy.
4. A mode-matching argument, including the effect of interactions, explains the shift in the minimum of the inverse participation ratio (IPR) and the non-monotonic behavior of the condensate fraction, revealing that the resonance energy is crucial in determining the extent of delocalization in the presence of interactions.

2. Type 1 AGN face-on view exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer, while type 2 AGN are seen edge-on, blocking the line of sight to the hot dust.
3. Observations show that type 1 AGN have significantly more infrared (IR) emission than type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity, suggesting stronger IR anisotropy in type 1 AGN.
4. The wavelength dependence of this anisotropy can provide insights into the dust torus's structure, distinguishing between smoothly distributed dust and dust clouds.
5. High-spatial-resolution observations can isolate AGN emission from host galaxy contributions, but representative samples are challenging to assemble due to observational limitations.
6. High-luminosity objects at higher redshifts, where AGN outshine the host galaxy, can be used to minimize host galaxy contamination and focus on AGN properties.
7. The study uses a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars, analyzing their mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to quantify the wavelength dependence of AGN emission anisotropy.
8. The sample comprises 11 quasars and 8 radio galaxies, with the average SEDs showing a systematic difference in IR emission between the two types, with radio galaxies being lower in IR emission.

2. A new model proposes that these hi supershells are formed by radio jets from the galactic nucleus that plow through the interstellar medium (ISM), accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles.
3. This jet-ISM interaction model provides an internal energy source for the hi supershells, explains their spatial symmetries, and resolves the energy problem associated with their formation.

2. IGR J170913624, a new X-ray transient source, exhibits similar variability patterns, including a 'heartbeat' pattern, but is significantly fainter than GRS 1915 + 105.
3. The apparent faintness of IGR J170913624 is difficult to explain with the smallest possible black hole mass and the largest possible distance, suggesting other factors at play.
4. To investigate the faintness, simultaneous spectral fitting across different phases of the 'heartbeat' oscillations was performed, with system parameters held constant.
5. The analysis suggests that the primary reason for IGR J170913624's faintness is its low or negative spin, in contrast to the high spin of GRS 1915 + 105.
6. The simultaneous spectral fitting indicates a lower limit on the inclination angle of IGR J170913624 at 76 degrees, with a lower limit on inclination at 105 degrees if the normalization is at its 90% upper confidence limit.
7. The study proposes that IGR J170913624 could potentially have a retrograde spin, which is challenging to explain theoretically.
8. The research also explores the possibility that the 66 Hz high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (hfqpo) detected in IGR J170913624 may be related to the black hole mass, but this is less likely.

2. Spectroscopic parameters are not affected by reddening, unlike photometric methods, and can be used to fit stars to theoretical isochrones or evolutionary tracks to determine mass, age, and distance.
3. Traditional methods using ionisation and excitation equilibrium in local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) have shown systematic biases, especially at low metallicity and/or surface gravity, necessitating the development of sophisticated methods to reconcile these effects.
4. This work introduces a new methodology, nlte-opt, which utilizes the balmer line method for effective temperature and nlte ionization balance of iron to determine surface gravity and metallicity, avoiding the systematic biases present in lte-based methods.

The study identifies the occurrence of chimera states in networks of 2d and 3d Hindmarsh-Rose ( HR) models, which are more realistic models for single neuron dynamics compared to the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. The research explores various coupling schemes and their effects on the emergence of chimera states, revealing that chimera states can occur with multiple domains of incoherence and coherence, and also identifies a novel mixed oscillatory state (mos) where desynchronized neurons are interspersed among those that are either stationary or oscillate in synchrony.
2. The findings contribute to the understanding of synchronization phenomena in complex systems, such as the human brain, and have implications for neuroscience applications. The study also verifies the existence of chimera states in coupled bistable elements, expanding the known conditions under which these states can arise.

2. The paper introduces a method to identify relevant elements and predicts their scaling with system size, revealing that the number of relevant elements increases as @xmath0 on the critical line, and scales as @xmath0 in the chaotic phase.
3. Numerical results show that the average cycle length in Kauffman networks increases almost exponentially with the number of relevant elements in some range, and the average weight of the attraction basins exhibits non-monotonic behavior versus the number of relevant elements, with different characteristics in the chaotic phase and on the critical line.

1. Low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( LLAGNs) are prevalent in the nearby galaxy population and are thought to be powered by accretion onto super - massive black holes, with their low luminosities often explained by the advection - dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model.
2. The ADAF model predicts a submillimetre bump in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of LLAGNs, while the standard disc model is responsible for the high - frequency radio bump observed in luminous AGNs like quasars.
3. Observations at centimetre bands have been the primary method for studying LLAGNs, but have been hindered by contamination from jets, which are more prominent at these frequencies.
4. To overcome this, the authors conducted a high - frequency radio survey using the Noble Yatsugatake Radio Observatory's Noble Yatsugatake Millimetre Array (NYRO/NMA) and archival submillimetre data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT).
5. The survey revealed inverted high - frequency radio spectra in at least half of the LLAGNs studied, with a clear inverse correlation between the high - frequency spectrum and the low - frequency radio core power.
6. Submillimetre fluxes measured with the SCUBA on the JCMT were found to be associated with the dust in the host galaxies, and were used to estimate dust contamination in the NMA measurements.
7. The authors conclude that the inverted high - frequency spectra are intrinsic properties of the LLAGN cores, and provide potential evidence for the existence of the ADAF, which would allow for direct imaging of accretion discs with future high - frequency radio instruments.

1. The study proposes three methods to measure the dust extinction law slope ( @xmath0 ) in the direction of differentially - reddened galactic globular clusters using three-band optical photometry.
2. The methods rely on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch ( hb ) is minimized when the correct @xmath0 value is used to correct for extinction and reddening.
3. The first two methods, ""@xmath25 rms"" and ""@xmath25 slope,"" use three-band photometry of cluster stars and are tested on simulated data sets.
4. The ""@xmath25 rms"" method measures the rms scatter in hb stars as a function of @xmath3 values derived from color excesses, while the ""@xmath25 slope"" method plots the difference in @xmath3 values against each other.
5. The third method, ""optical/ir,"" uses two-band photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission to correct for extinction and reddening on a star-by-star basis.
6. The study finds that the ""@xmath25 rms"" and ""@xmath25 slope"" methods can determine @xmath0 to an accuracy of 0.3 for clusters with low photometric error ( @xmath1550.3 mag), but with some systematic biases.
7. The ""optical/ir"" method generally provides less precise estimates of @xmath0 across the full range of photometric errors explored.
8. Combining results from all three methods yields a mean extinction law slope of @xmath7 for the line of sight towards the low-latitude galactic globular cluster NGC 4833.
9. The study also estimates the amount of small-scale structure in the dust complex in the foreground of NGC 4833 by analyzing the scatter in the cluster hb.
10. The small-scale power spectrum derived from cluster optical data matches the larger-scale power spectrum derived from the Schlegel et al. (1998) map of the dust thermal emission, which averages over small-scale reddening variations.

2. The study reveals that kondo screening persists even in the antiferromagnetic ordered state, with no kondo breakdown observed, even at half-filling and small values of the coupling parameter.
3. The transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is continuous, associated with the backfolding of the large fermi surface, and does not involve a kondo breakdown.
4. Within the antiferromagnetic phase, the fermi surface topology changes from hole pockets centered around @xmath0 to those centered around @xmath1, corresponding to a change in the effective mass of the heavy fermions.
5. The transition in the fermi surface topology is modeled as two continuous lifshitz transitions, with the volume of the hole pockets adjusting to maintain the luttinger sum rule.
6. The DCA+QMC approach successfully captures the essential physics of the KLM, including the absence of kondo breakdown and the continuous nature of the fermi surface topology change, without the need for exact lattice quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

1. The study presents a methodology to set upper bounds on the coupling between the Higgs field and spacetime curvature, specifically the Kretschmann invariant, by analyzing spectroscopic observations of carbon-rich white dwarfs. The researchers used the spectra of the white dwarfs bpm 27606 and procyon b, focusing on the c@xmath3 molecular bands and atomic lines (ci and mgii). They found no significant wavelength shifts between electronic and vibrational transitions, suggesting that the Higgs field's coupling to spacetime curvature is weak. The upper bounds on the Higgs-Kretschmann coupling are significantly stricter than those from LHC experiments, with values ranging from 1.3 x 10^-19 m to 5 x 10^-21 m depending on the assumed Planck length.
2. The findings are relevant for models where the Higgs field plays a role in cosmology, such as inflation and dark energy, and could be more stringent if considering quantum radiative corrections. The methodology is complementary to LHC-based bounds and can be applied to other scalar fields, potentially leading to even tighter constraints. The study also suggests improvements for future spectroscopic analyses, including better measurements of pressure shifts and a more detailed understanding of white dwarf atmospheres.

We apply radiative and chemical post-processing to large-scale galactic disk simulations to compute the equilibrium chemical and thermal state of the disk, focusing on the molecular content of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of a realistic stellar distribution and multifrequency radiative transfer.
2. Our results show significant concentrations of H2 and CO are vertically restricted to within a few parsecs of the galactic midplane, with H2 showing a filamentary morphology and CO concentrated in the highest density clumps.
3. Radiative shielding is crucial for the development of significant H2 and CO, with self-shielding being dominant for H2 and regime-dependent shielding for CO, which includes both dust and self-shielding mechanisms.
4. We compare various local approximations for radiative shielding to ray-tracing based solutions and find the six-ray approximation, temperature-capped jeans length, and power-law fit perform the best in matching the H2 and CO abundances of the fiducial model, with the temperature-capped jeans length being the most effective for H2.

The study utilizes data from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to investigate the relationship between star formation and cluster mass in low redshift galaxy clusters, focusing on obscured star-forming galaxies (demi-LIRGs) out to 3 times the virial radius in a sample of 69 clusters.
2. The research confirms that the mean specific star formation rate (mssfr) of cluster galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center, but remains below the field value even at large radii, suggesting that star formation is suppressed in a significant population of galaxies beyond the virial radius.
3. The fraction of demi-LIRGs also increases with projected distance but remains below the field value, indicating that these galaxies may have been previously quenched in lower-density environments such as small groups or filaments.
4. The study finds no significant correlation between the total cluster star formation rate normalized by cluster mass (cssfr) and cluster mass, suggesting that cluster mechanisms dependent on mass, like ram pressure or harassment, do not play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in local clusters.
5. The results imply that the dominant process for regulating star formation in dense environments is efficient in small groups or filaments, with strangulation being a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies.
6. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies and contribute to the understanding of star formation in galaxy clusters, challenging the notion that cluster-specific star formation is strongly dependent on cluster mass.

3. The method incorporates the electroweak meson-exchange current model, which includes contributions from pion production amplitudes and various current matrix elements.
4. The study validates the frozen approximation by comparing the approximate 2p-2h response functions with exact results in the relativistic fermi gas model.
5. The frozen approximation is found to be accurate for momentum transfers above the fermi momentum, and it is particularly effective for the transverse responses that dominate the cross section.
6. The approach uses an effective propagator for the @xmath0 resonance, averaged over the fermi sphere, which is analytically defined and allows for a one-dimensional integral.
7. The frozen approximation is expected to be valid for other two-particle-two-hole models, making it useful for implementing these models in monte carlo event generators used by neutrino collaborations.

2. The Laor model, which assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used but is limited to a specific spin value and does not allow for data fitting of the angular momentum.
3. The new model relaxes this limitation and allows the angular momentum to be fitted, providing a more accurate description of the iron line shape, especially for higher quality data.
4. The marginally stable orbit, which is closer to a black hole with higher spin, is used to estimate the spin in the Laor model.
5. The comparison of the Laor and new models for two sources, mcg-6 - 30 - 15 (active galaxy) and gx 339 - 4 (x-ray binary), shows that the new model provides a better fit and more reliable constraints on the spin.
6. The new model tends to overestimate the spin value compared to the Laor model, and it has insufficient energy resolution affecting the determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.

3. The ""displace, cut, and reflect"" method is a principal technique to generate such solutions, but it often results in anisotropic matter content with different radial and azimuthal pressures.
4. This article aims to apply the ""displace, cut, and reflect"" method to spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates to create static disks of perfect fluid, with equal radial and azimuthal pressures.
5. The method involves displacing and cutting a static sphere of perfect fluid and reflecting the remaining space to form a disk, with a halo of perfect fluid matter.
6. The generated disks are characterized by well-behaved density and pressure, satisfying the strong energy condition and the no tachyonic matter condition.
7. The stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is analyzed using an extension of Rayleigh's criterion, which is always satisfied for the considered disks.

The study presents a field-theoretical description of binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with a coupling drive, leading to the existence of domain walls where the relative phase between the two condensates changes by @xmath0. These walls are not topologically stable and can decay, overcoming an energy barrier. The metastability condition for the domain wall is derived, showing that it is stable when the rabi frequency is below a critical value. The decay mechanisms are discussed, with the rate exponentially suppressed at low temperatures due to quantum tunneling.
2. The paper also explores the physical interpretation of domain walls, suggesting a method for their creation in experiments by controlling the coupling drive and the relative motion of the condensates. The existence of vortex confinement is considered, where vortices of different types are bound together, analogous to quark confinement in quantum chromodynamics. The authors conclude that the creation of genuine two-component BECs with interpenetrating condensates could enable experimental realization of these domain walls.

The results show that the QGP has higher internal and free energies compared to strange quark matter, and the presence of the one-gluon exchange interaction facilitates the transition to the deconfined phase at lower baryon densities and temperatures. The phase diagram indicates that the QGP forms at lower temperatures and densities when the one-gluon exchange interaction is considered.

1. The study investigates the temperature range at which the nodal characteristics of the gap in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) are directly observable by thermal conductivity and whether thermal activation of quasiparticles can explain experimental results across the entire temperature range.
2. The researchers calculate the thermal conductivity at different angles and temperatures, assuming an Andreev reflection model for quasiparticle scattering by vortices, and compare it to experimental data from angle scans in a magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO2 planes of yba@xmath6cu@xmath9o@xmath10 HTS samples.
3. The results confirm the predominance of the d-wave gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature and show that the angular patterns of the thermal conductivity can be well described by a model involving Andreev reflection and the two-dimensional BCS theory for thermal transport.
4. The study also suggests that the observed differences in the angle patterns between twinned and untwinned samples can be explained by variations in impurity concentration and oxygen deficiency, and that the thermal activation of quasiparticles at different orientations from the gap nodes influences the behavior of the thermal conductivity above the critical temperature.

1. Anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) models have been studied for their attractive features, such as calculable soft terms and flavor invariance, but suffer from negative slepton mass squared parameters, which are resolved by assuming additional scalar masses.
2. Hypercharged anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( hcamsb ) models localize susy breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, suppressing gravity mediation contributions and allowing for a different set of soft susy breaking parameters.
3. The hcamsb model's parameter space is characterized by a dimensionless quantity, and the model's predictions for sparticle masses and spectra are calculated, showing distinct differences from the minimal amsb model, such as severe left-right splitting of scalar masses and different mass ordering in the neutralino sector.
4. The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC) reach for hcamsb models is explored, with the model expected to be distinguishable from minimal amsb models at the LHC due to differences in sparticle spectra and decay signatures, particularly in the lightest squark states and the lightest stau state.
5. The hcamsb model's implications for LHC searches include a higher multiplicity of @xmath0 jets, distinctive dilepton invariant mass distributions, and potentially observable tracks from long-lived wino-like chargino states, which could serve as signatures for distinguishing hcamsb from minimal amsb models.

1. The zero range potential (ZRP) approach, developed by Demkov and Ostrovsky and others, offers an exact solution to scattering problems by representing the ZRP as a boundary condition on the wavefunction or as a pseudopotential.
2. The Darboux transformation (DT) technique, based on the covariance property of the Schrödinger equation, can be used to modify the generalized ZRP boundary condition, creating potentials with discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum.
3. The DT technique is applied to correct the ZRP model, particularly at low energies where polarization effects are significant. This is demonstrated through calculations of electron scattering by multi-center structures, showing that the DT can reproduce the Ramsauer-Townsend minimum observed experimentally.
4. The DT technique also allows for the correction of the ZRP model at higher collision energies by considering higher partial waves, improving the agreement in size and position of shape resonances.

1. The Norris Survey of the Corona Borealis Supercluster provides a sample of galaxies suitable for studying the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function ( LF) and its dependence on environment.
2. The survey's local LF, when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields, agrees well with the Las Campanas Redshift Survey ( LCRS), but the normalization is roughly 1.6 times higher than the Stromlo/APM survey.
3. The field LF shows evolution, with the population of blue, star-forming galaxies becoming more luminous with increasing redshift, and the median color of the field galaxy population does not change.
4. The LFs of the two superclusters (corona borealis and Abell 2069) show significant differences from the field LF, despite overall similarity. The superclusters contain a population of very bright galaxies, and there is a hint of a sharp upturn in the supercluster LF for the least luminous galaxies.
5. The differences between the field and supercluster LFs suggest that environmental effects influence galaxy formation and evolution, but the fundamental physical processes driving galaxy formation and evolution do not strongly depend on environment.

1. Rapidity gaps in hadronic collisions, particularly at the Tevatron, have been observed and are attributed to color singlet exchange, with gluon exchange being the simplest model.
2. The two-gluon exchange model predicts a decrease in the color singlet fraction with increasing jet transverse energy, which is not supported by experimental data.
3. Unitarity constraints on the two-gluon exchange model reveal that the model violates partial wave unitarity, necessitating a fully unitarized amplitude for accurate predictions.
4. Unitarization of the two-gluon exchange amplitude leads to a universal phase shift, which significantly alters the color singlet exchange fraction.
5. The color singlet exchange fraction's dependence on regularization parameters is strong, making it unreliable to calculate within perturbation theory.
6. The unitarized model introduces two parameters: the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift, which can describe the rapidity gap data.
7. The unitarized model predicts a strong dependence of the color singlet fraction on the regularization procedure, which is not suitable for making quantitative predictions.

1. The axial anomaly, traditionally interpreted as an ultraviolet effect, is shown to have an infrared interpretation through the dispersive approach, which relates it to the non-conservation of helicity in the chiral limit. This interpretation is extended to helicity-changing processes, such as polarized radiative decays, where the axial anomaly manifests as a non-vanishing decay rate in the chiral limit. The cancellation of mass singularities in these processes is shown to be different from the usual real and virtual photon compensation mechanism, and is instead controlled by the axial anomaly.
2. The paper examines the structure of mass singularities and their cancellation in the radiative decays of pions and muons, highlighting the differences between unpolarized and polarized decays. It is found that the collinear limit is disconnected from the infrared limit in helicity-changing processes, and that the axial anomaly implies a finite result in the collinear limit, independent of the fermion mass. This suggests a more systematic treatment of infrared and collinear singularities in other gauge theories like QCD.

8. The model performs well on bruce-a and judd-a datasets but experiences a significant drop in performance on more complex datasets.

The authors describe a method for proving that obstructions are cocycles by using a detailed exposition of a heuristic method developed by Shrestha, applying it to prove that obstructions are cocycles for a family of pasting diagrams sufficient to imply the result in general, and making explicit a point overlooked in previous theorems regarding the independence of cochain maps from choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions.
3. The paper provides explicit examples of deformation complexes associated with various shapes of commutative pasting diagrams, demonstrating that cochain maps induced by different associations of 2-dimensional compositions are chain homotopic, and discusses the use of polygonal methods to encode cocycle conditions and obstructions, ultimately concluding that obstructions to deformations of pasting diagrams are cocycles under certain conditions.

1. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) and Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 4911 and 162(e) have different purposes and definitions of lobbying, leading to potential discrepancies in public disclosure of lobbying activities. LDA aims for transparency in federal lobbying efforts, while IRC sections 4911 and 162(e) focus on tax-exempt status and income tax deductions for lobbying expenses. LDA covers federal lobbying exclusively and includes a broader range of activities, while IRC definitions cover federal, state, and local lobbying and include grassroots efforts. The IRC definitions have exceptions that could exclude significant lobbying expenses from reporting, potentially resulting in underreporting.
2. The differences in definitions can affect registration and reporting under LDA, with organizations potentially not registering or disclosing less information if using IRC definitions. Options to address these discrepancies include harmonizing the definitions, eliminating the use of IRC definitions for LDA purposes, or requiring organizations to report only federal lobbying expenses when using IRC definitions for LDA reporting. Each option has trade-offs that need to be considered by Congress.

1. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been evaluating strategic sourcing in federal acquisitions for over a decade, noting that leading companies have shifted from individual procurements to a broader, enterprise-wide approach, resulting in substantial savings and more efficient procurement processes.
2. Despite the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementing strategic sourcing practices in 2005 through the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI), federal agencies have only leveraged a small fraction of their buying power, with most not addressing their highest spending areas like services, which offer significant savings opportunities.
3. Challenges for federal agencies in strategic sourcing include obtaining reliable data, securing expertise, leadership commitment, and developing metrics. Agencies also face disincentives for using strategic sourcing contracts, such as perceived loss of control and difficulty in standardizing requirements for services.
4. Leading companies have demonstrated that strategic sourcing can yield savings of 4 to 15 percent over prior year spending by analyzing procurement spending rigorously, centralizing procurement knowledge, and tailoring tactics based on service complexity and supplier availability. The GAO recommends that federal agencies adopt similar practices, focusing on high spend categories and overcoming existing challenges to increase the use of strategic sourcing.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engages in aviation safety oversight, air traffic control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development, with costs varying based on service usage and nature. Safety activities are driven by volume, while ATC services are influenced by the amount and type of services used, and GA flights' use of these services varies. FAA funds airport infrastructure development through the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which is not directly linked to user costs, unlike safety and ATC services. The Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 established the Trust Fund to support FAA's capital accounts and research, development, and operations, funded by dedicated excise taxes. Trust Fund revenues have exceeded spending commitments, but expenditures exceeded revenues in 2005, leading to a decline in the uncommitted balance. General Fund revenues have also been used to fund FAA, with the contribution varying greatly.
2. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission recommended that FAA's revenues be more closely linked to service costs, including capital investments, and that General Fund revenues support aviation security and safety activities. Concerns about the current funding system include revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency, as revenues collected do not always reflect the costs imposed by different flights. The current system raises concerns about the adequacy of future revenues to meet increasing workloads and costs, with trends suggesting a decline in revenues relative to workload.
3. Alternative funding options include modifying the current excise tax structure, such as increasing fuel taxes or the passenger segment tax, and implementing more direct charges to users, such as weight/distance charges, en-route charges, flight segment charges, and certification charges. These options aim to better align revenues with costs, but each has limitations and potential administrative and transition issues. A combination of these options may address concerns more effectively.
4. Debt financing for FAA capital projects offers advantages like stable revenue and spreading costs over the project's life but raises concerns about encumbering future resources, lack of congressional oversight, and borrowing costs. The Treasury and DOT have concerns about the current funding system and the need for a cost accounting system",1

The U.S. Postal Service, the nation's largest civilian employer, had about 765,000 career employees at the end of fiscal year 1997, with a significant portion of the workforce at the cluster level. The Postal Service's diversity development program aimed to foster an inclusive environment and promote the recruitment, retention, and upward mobility of women and minorities, with a goal of achieving a diverse workforce. A study by Aguirre International, commissioned by the Postal Service Board of Governors, found that while the Service was a leader in meeting affirmative action goals, women and minorities faced challenges advancing to EAS 17 and above positions. The Service developed an action plan to address these issues and implemented 23 initiatives to improve its diversity program.

2. The study by Aguirre International used multiple research methods, including data analysis, policy review, and interviews, to assess the effectiveness of the Postal Service's diversity program. The study found that women and minorities were generally underrepresented in higher EAS positions compared to lower ones, and there appeared to be a glass ceiling at EAS 17 and above levels. However, the Postal Service disagreed with the glass ceiling finding, noting that women and minorities were promoted to these positions, albeit in varying percentages. The Postal Service has made progress in implementing its diversity initiatives, with nine completed and seven nearing completion as of December 1998.

3. The Postal Service has developed diversity goals and objectives and is working on establishing specific targets and measures to track progress. However, the Service has not fully captured or used EEO data on promotion applicants, which is necessary to identify and remove barriers to promotions. The Postal Service is also improving its data collection methods in response to recommendations from the Aguirre report.

1. The Comanche program, initiated in 1983, aimed to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet with a low-cost, advanced technology helicopter for armed reconnaissance and attack missions, but faced funding cuts and restructuring in 1994, leading to a reduced budget and extended development timeline.
2. The Secretary of Defense's restructuring decision in 1994 cut Comanche program funding from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for FY 1996-2001, extended the development phase by 3 years, and deferred the Comanche production decision.
3. The Army proposed a restructured program to acquire six ""early operational capability"" aircraft and defer developmental efforts to FY 2002 and beyond, with approval from DOD in March 1995.
4. The restructured program risks making production decisions before knowing if the aircraft meets performance requirements and potentially incurs higher program costs.
5. The Comanche program has seen significant increases in program acquisition unit cost since 1985, with the estimated cost per aircraft rising by 185% from $12.1 million to $34.4 million, and the total program cost exceeding $44 billion for 1,292 aircraft.
6. The Comanche's software development is extensive, with about 1.4 million lines of code required, and the use of Ada programming language, which has its own set of challenges, including delays and issues with the Ada compilation system.
7. The Comanche program's maintainability requirements, such as direct maintenance man-hours per flight hour and mean time to repair, are at risk of not being met, which could impact the program's cost and availability goals.
8.

The program has undergone several changes to increase access and reduce reporting burdens, including options and waivers related to eligibility, reporting requirements, and extending benefits to households leaving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). States implement the program by determining eligibility based on income and asset limits, with the actual benefit amount calculated after certain deductions. Categorical eligibility allows TANF recipients to automatically qualify for food stamps without separate eligibility determination. States have the option to merge TANF and Food Stamp Program rules into a single set of requirements, and the USDA monitors program accountability through a quality control system that measures states' performance in accurately determining eligibility and calculating benefits.

2. States have used various options and waivers to simplify the food stamp eligibility determination process, including exempting vehicles from asset calculations and altering reporting requirements for households with earnings. The Transitional Benefit Alternative and the Simplified Food Stamp Program are options under consideration to support families transitioning from welfare to work and to streamline program administration, respectively. However, states have concerns about implementation costs, complexity, and potential increases in payment errors associated with these options.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) is planning to replace the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) and the 86th Medical Group (MDG) clinic with a new medical facility near Ramstein Air Base, Weilerbach Storage Area, to consolidate services and improve efficiency. The new facility will be operated by the Army and will provide tertiary care for the EUCOM, Central Command, and Africa Command theaters of operation. The project was initially approved with separate renovation plans for each facility but was later consolidated into a single project after a cost-benefit analysis. The facility's design incorporates quality and environmentally friendly standards, including evidence-based design and LEED green building standards.

2. DOD's planning for the replacement medical center considered beneficiary population data, contingency operations, and troop strength changes. However, recent posture changes announced in January 2012, including the removal of two brigade combat teams from Europe, are being assessed for their impact on the facility's requirements. The facility is designed to accommodate peacetime operations with the flexibility to expand for contingency operations. Despite the design's flexibility, the exact impact of these posture changes on the facility's size and capacity remains uncertain.

3. DOD's cost estimating process for the replacement medical center largely met best practices but was minimally documented. The cost estimate was validated by an independent firm, but the documentation did not clearly demonstrate how facility requirements factored into cost elements. The cost estimate did not include recurring life cycle costs, such as sustainment, support infrastructure, or operation and maintenance costs. DOD is expected to recertify the facility's size and scope in response to potential posture changes and to revise the cost estimate using established best practices.

6. In 2010, costs per transport ranged from $224 to $2,204, with a median of $429, and the variability in costs was influenced by provider characteristics such as volume of transports, intensity of Medicare transports, and level of government subsidies.
7. The median Medicare margin for providers in the sample was about 2% in 2010, but excluding add-on payments, it decreased to a negative 1% median.
8. Ambulance transports for Medicare beneficiaries increased by 33% from 2004 to 2010, with the largest increase in super-rural areas, primarily due to a rise in BLS nonemergency transports.
9. Increased billing for Medicare by local governments contributed to the rise in ambulance transports, despite potential reductions in community support and volunteer participation.
10. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found an association between increased resources and increased costs in the ambulance industry, and providers with higher costs tend to seek additional government support.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is the largest producer, collector, and user of personal information in the U.S., responsible for issuing Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and maintaining wage and earnings information, which is used in tax administration and protected by statute and regulation since the inception of the Social Security program.
2. SSA's disclosure policy, designed to protect individuals' privacy rights, has been revised to comply with about 25 statutes, including the Privacy Act of 1974, which regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information by federal agencies. The Privacy Act requires agencies to inform individuals about the collection of their information and prohibits disclosure without consent, with 12 exceptions.
3. SSA's policy is more restrictive than most federal agencies, including the IRS and Census Bureau, and is based on the agency's pledge to maintain confidentiality. SSA's disclosure policy allows sharing of nontax information with law enforcement under certain conditions, such as fraud or criminal activity in Social Security programs, nonviolent crimes, violent and serious crimes, jeopardy to SSA clients, personnel, or facilities, and disclosure required by other federal statutes.
4. SSA's disclosure policy is implemented through regulations in the Program Operations Manual System (POMS) and Emergency Messages, and field offices handle requests for disclosing information. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) can disclose information to law enforcement under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SSA, but SSA's policy requires additional considerations before releasing personal information to law enforcement.
5. SSA's disclosure policy is complex and sometimes confusing, leading to inconsistent application. To ensure consistent application, the Commissioner of SSA should clarify the policy, provide additional training, and consider delegating decision-making authority to specified units with expertise in SSA's disclosure policy. SSA should also provide law enforcement with clear information on its disclosure policy and procedures.

2. EPA has established criteria for identifying hazardous waste, which includes specific types listed by source or characteristic, and these regulations apply to all hazardous waste regardless of its origin.
3. Remediation waste, generated during cleanups, is subject to RCRA's stringent requirements, leading to proposals to amend the law to exempt certain types of remediation waste from these requirements and allow states to set their own management standards.
4. EPA's proposed rule in 1996 to provide alternative management methods for remediation waste was withdrawn due to disagreements among stakeholders, and the agency plans to issue regulations covering four specific elements affecting remediation waste instead.
5. Cleanup managers often cite land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements as the three most significant RCRA requirements that add unnecessary costs and time to cleanups, leading to less aggressive remedies and potential under-cleaning of sites.
6. EPA and state officials have used policy and regulatory alternatives to mitigate the impact of RCRA's requirements on remediation waste cleanups, but these alternatives have been complex, inconsistently applied, and sometimes legally challenged, leading to the conclusion that comprehensive reform of RCRA's requirements for managing remediation waste is best achieved through legislative action.

The Medicare Integrity Program (MIP), established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), provides dedicated funding for Medicare program integrity activities, which have increased from about $438 million in fiscal year 1997 to $714 million by fiscal year 2005, with a maximum of $720 million annually. MIP funds support various activities, including audits, medical review, secondary payer activities, benefit integrity, and provider education, with varying levels of funding and percentage increases over the years. Provider education received the largest percentage increase in funds, while audit and medical review received the largest amount of funds overall.
2. CMS allocates MIP funds primarily to support its contractors' program integrity efforts for the traditional Medicare program, with the five activities receiving different shares of the funds. CMS has developed qualitative assessments of the impact of benefit integrity and provider education, but has not routinely collected information to evaluate their comparative effectiveness. CMS officials have expressed concerns about the difficulty of developing quantitative measures for the benefit integrity activity and the use of return on investment (ROI) as a sole basis for funding decisions.
3. CMS plans to develop objective measures of the results of the audit and provider education activities, and to use MIP funds as award payments to encourage contractors to perform program integrity tasks effectively. However, CMS's current allocation approach, which relies on historical funding allocations and does not consider quantitative or qualitative data on the effectiveness of its program integrity activities, may not be adequate to address emerging program integrity risks and ongoing programmatic changes, such as the addition of the new Part D prescription drug benefit and Medicare contracting reform. CMS is encouraged to develop a method of allocating funds based on the effectiveness of its program integrity activities, the contractors' workloads, and risk.

The IRS' Operations Center manages the network, forecasting call demand, planning call routing, and monitoring staffing and call traffic. However, the IRS lacks a long-term service-level goal, which hinders strategic planning and performance measurement.
2. IRS' approach to staffing and service level is inconsistent with federal guidance and industry practices, which recommend setting goals based on customer needs and measuring performance towards achieving these goals. IRS' interim goals for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 were 58% and 60% service levels, respectively, without a clear long-term objective.
3. IRS faces challenges in recruiting, training, retaining, and scheduling customer service representatives due to job characteristics, inadequate resources, and the cyclical nature of taxpayer demand. The IRS is developing a national recruiting strategy and considering specialized training for specific taxpayer groups.

The Department of the Interior (DOI), through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of the Special Trustee (OST), is responsible for accounting for revenue, investing trust funds, and maintaining land records. Despite efforts to reform trust management, concerns led to the development of a Comprehensive Trust Management Plan in 2003, which outlines strategies for improving business processes and serves as a guide for trust reform.
2. In response to the Comprehensive Trust Management Plan, the Secretary of the Interior reorganized BIA and OST in 2003, increasing OST's staff and budget to manage trust funds and implement reforms. OST's budget grew from $34.1 million in FY 1997 to $222.8 million in FY 2006, with funding also supporting other Indian-related activities.
3. OST has implemented key trust fund management reforms, including the Trust Funds Accounting System (TFAS) and a centralized Trust Beneficiary Call Center, and is working on integrating various automated systems and managing land appraisals. However, OST has not set a timetable for completing trust reforms or identified a termination date for the office, despite the 1994 Act's sunset provision.
4. OST has relied on contractors for many trust reform activities, with a significant portion of its budget allocated to contracting. The Special Trustee has not developed a workforce plan for post-reform operations, but believes the current staff size is appropriate. OST's use of contractors has raised concerns about preferential treatment and the need for a more transparent and competitive procurement process.

Treasury's decision to extend TARP was influenced by quantitative indicators such as foreclosure rates, serious delinquency rates, and the ability of banks to raise capital in private markets, as well as qualitative factors like the fragile state of the economy and the need to retain resources to respond to potential financial instability.
2. Treasury's analytical framework for TARP decisions included public documents outlining the rationale for the extension, quantitative indicators, and program-specific decisions. However, Treasury has not yet set clear objectives for its small business lending programs, which raises questions about when and how to know if government assistance can be removed. Treasury's decision-making process involved coordination with the Federal Reserve and FDIC, but broader coordination could be enhanced for future decisions.

1. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from certain countries to travel to the United States for business or tourism without a visa, aiming to boost international travel and economic benefits, while enabling U.S. resources to focus on higher-risk countries. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees the program, which was established by the Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act in 2000 and expanded from eight to 36 countries since its inception in 1986.
2. To qualify for the VWP, countries must offer reciprocal visa-free travel, have a low visa refusal rate, issue machine-readable passports, and comply with various security and information-sharing requirements, including the use of e-passports with biometric identifiers since 2008.
3. VWP travelers must obtain authorization through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) and meet other eligibility criteria, such as not posing a threat to U.S. security or welfare and having a return ticket to a foreign destination.
4. DHS implemented ESTA to collect passenger data and conduct security checks before travel, reducing the burden on travelers by minimizing the frequency of biographical information submission and providing early notice of ineligibility. However, the ESTA fee has been a point of contention among travel industry officials and VWP countries.
5. DHS has not fully analyzed the risks of noncompliance with ESTA, and while carrier compliance with ESTA verification is high, DHS has not established a target date for reviewing cases of boarding without verified ESTA approval.
6. DHS has made progress in negotiating information-sharing agreements with VWP countries, but only half have entered into all required agreements. DHS has not completed timely biennial reviews of VWP countries, which are crucial for assessing security, law enforcement, and immigration interests, and Congress lacks assurance that DHS efforts to minimize vulnerabilities are based on up-to-date assessments.

1. The growth in foster care populations from 1984 to 1995, with federal support for about 261,000 children, has strained state child welfare systems, leading to various state and federal efforts to expedite the permanency planning process and reduce the time children spend in foster care. States have enacted laws to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing, with 26 states implementing such laws, and some focusing on reunification with families or adoption. However, the lack of systematic evaluations of these initiatives' effectiveness and the absence of evaluations to assess their impacts hinder understanding their overall impact.
2. States have implemented operational and procedural changes, such as concurrent planning and specialized training for caseworkers and judges, to improve the permanency process. These initiatives, while promising, require long-term commitment, consensus building, and resources, and may create unintended consequences if not balanced with efforts to develop adoptive homes. The need for evaluation information to understand the impact of these initiatives and identify unintended outcomes is emphasized.

The act requires adherence to new data standards set by the OMB and Treasury, with these agencies leading the government-wide implementation.
2. The OMB has taken steps to assist agencies in meeting reporting requirements, including establishing standardized data element definitions, issuing guidance to operationalize standards, and conducting readiness assessments with agencies.
3. The Treasury developed the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) and a broker system to standardize and validate financial and non-financial data reporting under the DATA Act.
4. The DATA Act also requires agency Inspectors General (IGs) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to assess and report on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of spending data, with the first IG reports due in November 2016.
5. Challenges identified in agency financial reports and IG readiness reviews indicate issues with internal controls, accounting and financial management, and IT security and controls, which may affect the quality of data submitted under the DATA Act.
6. The DATA Act broker extracts award and sub-award information from four award systems, but the data from these systems are not subject to validation in the broker, potentially affecting the completeness and accuracy of the reported data.
7. Agencies face challenges in reporting intragovernmental transactions, linking financial and award data, and ensuring data quality, with some agencies indicating they will not fully meet the May 2017 reporting requirements.

2. Interagency contracting involves three parties: the agency needing a service, the agency placing the order, and the contractors providing the service, with the contracting officer ensuring proper awarding and administration of contracts.
3. OSC has designated interagency contracting as a high-risk area and may hire intermittent consultants under 5 U.S.C. § 3109, which allows for the temporary or intermittent employment of experts or consultants without competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements.
4. OSC's primary mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited personnel practices, which includes conducting investigations, mediating informally, and prosecuting corrective actions before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).
5. In a specific case, OSC contracted with Management Planning and Resources, Inc. (MPRI) for an organizational assessment without seeking competition among Schedule vendors, justifying a sole-source order without sufficient facts and rationale, and not following GSA's special ordering procedures.
6. The sole-source justification lacked sufficient information to justify the sole-source order, and the contracting process was not properly documented, with ARC officials relying on OSC's input without questioning the justification.
7. The contracting officer's representative, who should monitor contractor performance and serve as a liaison, was not properly designated or trained, leading to unauthorized actions by OSC officials.
8. The report recommends that ARC's Division of Procurement ensure compliance with competition requirements and that program offices only have authorized officials acting as contracting officer's representatives, while the Special Counsel should establish procedures to ensure only trained and designated officials act in that role.

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees Medicare, a program serving about 33 million beneficiaries, and more than 400 managed care health plans, with enrollment growing by about 85,000 beneficiaries monthly. The Medicare statute divides benefits into hospital insurance (part A) and supplementary medical insurance (part B), covering a range of services and requiring premiums.
2. HCFA faces challenges in implementing legislative reforms, managing a high volume of claims, and maintaining a workforce amidst retirements and staff turnover. The agency's reorganization aims to focus on managed care, improve resource allocation, and address the need for specialized expertise in areas like IT, data analysis, and managed care.
3. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) grant HCFA authority to reform Medicare, introducing new health plan options, payment reforms, and anti-fraud measures. However, the agency's ability to effectively implement these reforms is hindered by resource constraints, staffing issues, and the need for system modernization.
4. HCFA's reorganization, while theoretically sound, is occurring amidst tight deadlines and full agendas, leading to concerns about the adequacy of resource distribution and the potential neglect of non-BBA-related tasks. The agency's ability to justify resource needs for other Medicare objectives remains uncertain, and there is a need for better communication and coordination within the agency.

3. The administration's reauthorization proposal suggests a shift from excise tax-based funding to a system based on cost-based charges, with funding for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) coming from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft, supplemented by General Fund contributions for certain services.
4. The proposal also introduces two new budget accounts—Air Traffic Organization and Safety and Operations—to align with FAA's lines of business and funding structure.
5. The proposal aims to address concerns about revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency by linking FAA's revenues more closely with its costs, including eliminating most excise taxes and establishing user charges and fees.
6. The proposal's effectiveness in linking costs with revenues depends on the soundness of FAA's cost allocation methodology and adherence to the principle of cost-based funding.
7. The proposal raises questions about the equity of funding AIP through equal fuel taxes on all aircraft operators and the impact of not applying congestion charges to all aircraft using busy airspace.
8. The proposed fuel tax rates may not yield the expected revenue due to potential reductions in fuel purchases, and the proposed AIP funding level is below recent Congressional funding levels.

FSA's performance plan outlines strategic goals to increase customer and employee satisfaction while decreasing unit costs, with measures such as the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and a unit cost measure to track progress. However, the unit cost measure has limitations, and FSA's performance plan lacks clarity on systems integration and program integrity strategies. FSA's annual reports to Congress have been incomplete, and the agency has not fully implemented performance management systems or addressed human capital management, including succession planning and training. Education is working on refining FSA's unit cost calculation, developing clear goals for systems integration, and enhancing program integrity measures. FSA's COO and senior managers are subject to performance agreements and bonuses tied to achieving these goals.

2. FSA has made progress in reforms, including gains in customer and employee satisfaction, but needs to improve reporting on systems integration, program integrity, and human capital management. Education is developing strategies to address these issues, including revising FSA's performance plan to include measurable goals for systems integration and compliance, and implementing a comprehensive human capital strategy.

Both programs use the same definition of disability for initial entitlement, but SSI is a means-tested program funded by general revenues, while DI is an insurance program financed by payroll taxes linked to a worker's earnings history. Concurrent beneficiaries, who receive benefits from both programs, represent about 14 percent of SSA's disability population, with a majority qualifying based on their work record and often having mental impairments.
2. Concurrent beneficiaries face challenges due to the complexity of the programs, as SSA lacks integrated guidance and procedures for handling their work activity information, leading to potential overpayments and underpayments. The SSA has taken steps to improve service to concurrent beneficiaries, such as creating a new position and software to handle work-related issues, but the effectiveness of these initiatives is still being evaluated.
3. Concurrent beneficiaries often do not fully utilize work incentives available to them, and the lack of coordination between the DI and SSI programs makes it difficult for SSA staff to adjust benefits accurately. The SSA's guidance does not provide integrated instructions for processing work information for concurrent beneficiaries, and field offices may not collect all required information or share it between programs.
4. To better serve concurrent beneficiaries and avoid overpayments, the SSA is advised to develop procedures and integrated guidance for collecting and sharing work activity information, establish comprehensive systems to monitor case progress, and create public information materials that clearly explain the interaction of the two programs. The SSA has agreed with these recommendations and is working on initiatives to address them.

2. The ALMRS/Modernization project, now renamed to ALMRS/Modernization, aims to automate land and mineral records, support land and resource management activities, and provide a common IT platform. It consists of three components: ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (ALMRS IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and technology modernization and rehosting of selected systems. The project's life-cycle costs were reduced to $575 million, with the goal of enhancing public access, integrating databases, and improving case processing times.
3. Despite meeting most of its schedule milestones, BLM faces potential schedule slippages due to the complexity of tasks and limited time for unforeseen issues. The project's development and testing schedule is tight, with little room for delays, and the deployment of ALMRS IOC and database conversions is also constrained by tight timelines.
4. BLM has taken measures to monitor the project's progress and schedule closely, including periodic oversight reviews, a consolidated project schedule, and rescheduling of software integration tests. However, the Bureau's plan to stress test only the ALMRS IOC portion of the system is deemed insufficient, as it does not account for the entire ALMRS/Modernization system's performance under peak workloads. The report recommends that BLM ensure thorough stress testing of the entire system before deployment. BLM has agreed with the recommendation and plans to stress test the entire ALMRS/Modernization system.

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an independent UN organization, oversees nuclear safeguards through its General Conference and Board of Governors, with the U.S. as a permanent Board member. The IAEA's authority comes from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other agreements, requiring non-nuclear weapon states to apply safeguards to all nuclear material and activities.
2. The IAEA's safeguards aim to prevent nuclear material diversion for weapons use, employing inspections, material accounting, containment measures, and surveillance to ensure compliance with peaceful use commitments.
3. The IAEA has strengthened its safeguards by seeking assurances of non-proliferation, developing capabilities to evaluate all aspects of a country's nuclear activities, and implementing measures like unannounced inspections and environmental sampling.
4. The IAEA's Additional Protocol enhances its authority to obtain comprehensive information and conduct ""complementary access"" for verification purposes, but its effectiveness is limited by the lack of universal adoption and practical access issues.
5. The IAEA faces challenges in verifying non-nuclear weapon states with significant nuclear activities, such as India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan, and in countries that have not adopted the Additional Protocol or have not concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements.
6. The IAEA's human capital crisis and the limitations of multilateral export control groups like the Nuclear Suppliers Group could hinder efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation, despite their successes in curbing the availability of proliferation-sensitive technology and equipment.

1. The Information Quality Act (IQA) mandates federal agencies to develop guidelines ensuring the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information they disseminate, and to establish mechanisms for affected persons to seek corrections and report IQA complaints to the OMB Director. OMB provided a framework for agencies to follow, including assistance in developing guidelines and requiring agencies to post IQA information on their websites.
2. Despite OMB's efforts, many agencies, especially smaller, nonregulatory ones, lacked IQA guidelines on their websites, and the public found accessing IQA information difficult. OMB and OIRA did not provide specific guidance on how to make IQA information more accessible online.
3. The implementation of IQA led to a decline in the number of IQA requests, particularly after FEMA stopped classifying certain requests as IQA requests. Substantive requests, which required more time and resources, increased as agencies shifted simple requests away from IQA.
4. IQA requests and appeals can take a long time to resolve, and there is no comprehensive data on the impact of IQA on agency operations or rulemaking processes. However, agencies and OMB have not found the implementation of IQA to be overly burdensome or adversely affecting agency operations.

1. Both mutual fund companies and banks serve as financial intermediaries, raising funds from savers and investing them back into the economy, with banks typically using deposits for loans or investments in government bonds, while mutual funds invest in securities like bonds and stocks.
2. The reliance on bank loans for financing has been decreasing since the 1960s, with companies increasingly turning to the securities markets for short-term funding and other financial needs.
3. Securitization, the process of converting loans into marketable securities, has been a significant factor in reducing the importance of bank loans, with banks and thrifts selling mortgages and other loans to financial intermediaries who then issue securities.
4. Mutual funds have also contributed to the shift away from bank loans, as they have attracted substantial amounts of money that might have otherwise been placed in bank deposits.
5. The Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry Association (SIA) acknowledge the impact of mutual funds on bank deposits, although the exact magnitude of this impact is debated among observers.
6. Data from the Flow of Funds Accounts indicate that mutual funds have attracted significant inflows, with total net flows into mutual funds from 1990 to 1994 amounting to $1,067 billion, suggesting a potential impact on bank deposits of less than $700 billion.
7. The relationship between deposits and GDP suggests that the impact of mutual funds on deposits could be substantial, but the exact amount is difficult to quantify due to various influencing factors.

2. The survey found that 81% of respondents modified the formulas of their DB plans, with 58% increasing the generosity for collective-bargaining employees and 48% decreasing it for nonbargaining employees due to the unpredictability of DB plan funding requirements.
3. For collective-bargaining employees, industry competitive pressures were the main reason for changes, while inflation or cost-of-living adjustments were key reasons for increasing benefits for bargaining unit plans.
4. Nonbargaining unit plans were more likely to be converted to hybrid plans, with 52% of respondents doing so, often due to trends in employee demographics.
5. Plan freezes were common, with 62% of respondents reporting a freeze or amendment to limit future pension accruals, and 8% of plans were hard frozen, while 20% were under a soft freeze or other form of freeze.

FEMA, under the Department of Homeland Security, oversees NFIP, which has been strengthened by subsequent legislation to encourage participation and mitigate flood risks.
2. NFIP mandates flood insurance for mortgage holders in high-risk areas and offers subsidized premiums for certain properties, but the program faces challenges with growing subsidized and grandfathered rates, which do not fully reflect the actual risk of flooding.
3. Increasing premium rates to reflect full risk could reduce taxpayer costs and encourage private market participation but may lead to higher costs for some homeowners, potentially reducing policy participation.
4. Mitigation efforts, such as elevation and relocation, can reduce flood damage and NFIP's financial exposure, but require upfront costs and may increase taxpayer expenses if federal assistance is provided to those who refuse mitigation.
5. Expanding NFIP participation could lower premiums and reduce taxpayer costs but must be carefully managed to avoid increasing the program's concentration of high-risk properties and to ensure a diversified risk pool.

The FDIC provided a $970 million capital infusion, and the banks' assets grew from $10.9 billion to $13.9 billion by September 1990, but subsequent loan quality issues and high operating expenses led to further losses and insolvency.
2. The FDIC and First City entered into a recapitalization agreement, which included a $970 million capital infusion from the FDIC and $500 million of private capital. The agreement also required the creation of a collecting bank to manage troubled assets and a guarantee for $100 million payable in 1998. Despite initial profits and dividend payments, the banks' loan portfolios deteriorated, and operating losses continued to mount, leading to the closure of First City-Houston and First City-Dallas by OCC and the Texas Banking Commissioner, respectively.
3. The FDIC considered various resolution plans, including acquisitions, capital infusions, and self-rescue strategies. The FDIC ultimately rejected a self-rescue proposal due to concerns about the bank management's ability to execute the plan and the requirement for FDIC to guarantee full payment for all deposits.
4. The FDIC opted for an interim bridge bank resolution, which was deemed the least costly and most orderly alternative. The FDIC sold the banks in January 1993, resulting in a surplus of about $60 million, contrary to the initial $500 million loss estimate. The surplus was later revised to potentially exceed $200 million.

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play crucial roles in providing mental health care to military personnel, with psychiatrists able to prescribe medication due to their medical training, while clinical psychologists focus on psychosocial treatments.
2. The MHSS established the Prescribing Psychologist Demonstration Project (PDP) in response to a 1988 conference report, aiming to train military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications under certain conditions, with the Army Surgeon General tasked to design and implement the program.
3. The PDP faced several implementation challenges, including ambiguous goals, recruitment difficulties, curriculum changes, and delays in granting prescribing privileges, leading to a lack of clear definition of the prescribing psychologists' roles and supervision issues.
4. Despite the PDP's intentions, the MHSS has an adequate number of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to meet its medical readiness requirements, making the additional training of psychologists to prescribe medication unnecessary and costly.
5. The PDP did not clearly define the role of prescribing psychologists, leading to persistent implementation problems and a lack of precedent for authorizing psychologists to prescribe medication.

1. Social Security, a significant federal program in the U.S., provides benefits to over 49 million beneficiaries, including retirees, disabled workers, and dependents, with average monthly payments ranging from $979 to $1,051. The program aims to balance income adequacy with equity, offering higher benefits to lower income beneficiaries and those with higher lifetime contributions. Despite its expansion over the years, Social Security faces solvency challenges, with projections indicating potential depletion of trust funds by 2041. Legislative efforts to control costs have led to benefit reductions and tightened eligibility standards, but interest in protecting vulnerable populations persists.

2. Social Security's financing relies on payroll taxes, and demographic shifts threaten its long-term solvency. Proposals to restore solvency include revenue enhancements, benefit reductions, and structural changes, but reforms could disproportionately affect disabled workers and dependents due to their reliance on Social Security income and potential difficulty in adjusting to benefit reductions. Protection options exist to mitigate the impact of reforms on these beneficiaries, but they come at a cost to the program's solvency.

3. The complexity of Social Security's various benefit types and the interconnectedness of its programs make comprehensive reform challenging. Any reform package must consider the implications for all beneficiaries, with particular attention to the most vulnerable, and should align the disability program with current scientific, medical, technological, and labor market conditions.

2. FSA's lack of thorough eligibility determinations led to payments being made to estates that may not have been eligible, with 73 estates (40%) not receiving any determinations from 1999 to 2005, and some estates receiving over $200,000 and $500,000 in payments without proper eligibility verification.
3. FSA sometimes approved eligibility based on insufficient information, with no clear explanation for keeping estates open, and in some cases, payments were made to groups of estates without any determinations.
4. The frequency and quality of FSA's eligibility determinations varied by state, with 16 out of 26 states making less than half of the required determinations from 1999 to 2005.
5. FSA's failure to conduct eligibility determinations resulted in improper payments to deceased individuals, with $1.1 billion in farm program payments made to 172,801 deceased individuals from 1999 to 2005, and 40% of these payments going to individuals who had been dead for 3 or more years, and 19% for 7 or more years.

1. The five U.S. territories of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have some discretion in setting Medicaid and CHIP standards and payments, with differences in program administration and funding compared to states. Territories have greater flexibility in setting income eligibility levels and can cover additional benefits beyond mandatory Medicaid benefits. However, they face funding limitations and must assume full costs once their Medicaid and CHIP funding is exhausted, leading to lower federal and territory Medicaid program expenditures. Temporary increases in Medicaid and CHIP funding have been provided by legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the PPACA, which also increased territories' FMAPs and CHIP enhanced FMAPs. Despite these efforts, territories may face future funding shortfalls and have limited program integrity oversight, with only Puerto Rico having a program integrity unit. The territories' Medicaid and CHIP programs reflect their unique circumstances, with variations in eligibility, benefits covered, and spending.

2. CMS provides limited oversight and assurance of program integrity in the territories due to their small program sizes and limited resources. Recommendations include reexamining CMS's program integrity strategy for the territories, assisting in improving Medicaid and CHIP spending information, and conducting additional program assessments of integrity as needed. HHS and DOI concur with the need for enhanced program integrity activities and acknowledge the territories' challenges in balancing service provision with program integrity efforts. The territories' Medicaid and CHIP programs are critical to their health care systems, but require additional federal support to ensure program integrity and manage risks effectively.

3. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) and OMB Circular No. A-25 provide the authority and guidelines for federal agencies to charge user fees, which must be fair, cost-based, and aligned with public policy or interest.
4. User fees should be set to recover program costs, with the beneficiary-pays principle guiding the proportion of costs covered by fees versus general revenues, depending on whether the program primarily benefits the general public or identifiable users.
5. The ability to pass along fees to others depends on market conditions and price elasticity, affecting the incidence of the fee and its perceived equity.
6. User fees can promote economic efficiency by ensuring resources are allocated to the most valued use, but may be regressive if they disproportionately burden low-income individuals.
7. The design of user fees must consider the ability to pay, potential policy goals, and the impact on competitiveness and equity, with exemptions and caps sometimes used to address these concerns.
8. Regular reviews and updates of user fees are necessary to ensure they remain aligned with program costs and activities, with stakeholder input playing a crucial role in the transparency and acceptance of fee structures.

The District of Columbia's public school system, which includes 58 local educational agencies (LEAs) and over 72,300 students in the 2009-2010 school year, faces challenges in managing federal payments for school improvement, with issues in grant and contract monitoring identified by the U.S. Department of Education.
2. The Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 transferred the management of public schools to the Mayor and created the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), which now oversees grant-making, oversight, and maintaining standards for both traditional public and public charter schools.
3. OSSE and DCPS have had problems with managing grants and contracts, as evidenced by audits revealing internal control deficiencies, and the U.S. Department of Education has designated OSSE as a ""high risk"" grantee. OSSE has used a significant portion of federal payments for charter school facilities, with less for other initiatives, and has limited written policies for monitoring grantees.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) sets a standard price per barrel for fuel annually, which is based on forecasted crude oil prices, a refinement markup, and nonproduct costs, with the aim of approximating the actual per barrel price during budget execution. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) sets this price in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), using economic assumptions provided by the Council of Economic Advisors, the Department of the Treasury, and OMB (the Troika).
2. The standard price is intended to remain unchanged until the next budget year to shield military services from market price volatility, with the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund covering the cash balance for DOD's bulk fuel purchasing, transportation, and storage. The fund aims to be revenue-neutral, but fluctuations in the actual fuel price can lead to adjustments in the standard price to maintain its cash balance.
3. From fiscal years 2009 to 2013, DOD's actual fuel costs differed from its estimates primarily due to market price fluctuations and differences between estimated and actual fuel consumption levels. The price for WTI crude oil diverged from other crude oil pricing benchmarks, and the refinement markup was not always accurate, leading to underestimations of actual fuel costs.
4. DOD has taken actions to manage the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, including transferring funds into and out of the fund and adjusting the standard price. However, these measures have disrupted other DOD programs and strained military services' budgets.
5. DOD has not reevaluated its approach to setting the standard price since 2007, despite significant differences between estimated and actual costs. The DOD's current approach does not account for changes in market conditions, such as the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices, and the use of WTI as a crude oil benchmark does not reflect current market conditions.

3. The DOD's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued critical reports highlighting issues with SPS, including inadequate functionality, user training, and the risks of relying on a single vendor for system support.
4. Despite these issues, DOD continued to fund and deploy SPS, with the latest release (version 4.2) failing acceptance testing and the fifth release still pending deployment due to software problems.
5. The DOD's economic analyses for SPS have not been updated to reflect the program's current status, including the increased number of releases and associated costs, resulting in an outdated assessment of the system's cost-benefit ratio.
6. The DOD has not effectively used incremental investment management practices for SPS, treating the entire program as a single investment decision rather than a series of smaller, justifiable increments.
7. The DOD has not demonstrated that SPS is producing the expected benefits that justify its costs, with the latest economic analysis showing a negative net present value for the program.
8. The DOD's approach to SPS management contradicts best practices and federal requirements, which emphasize the need for incremental investment decisions and the use of reliable data and credible analysis to justify IT investments.

1. The rapid increase in crack cocaine use in the 1980s, often referred to as a drug epidemic, highlighted the need for effective drug use detection and response mechanisms. Researchers and government agencies monitor changing drug use patterns, such as new drug emergence, changes in drug administration methods, and shifts in drug use levels among specific populations or geographic areas, to identify potential epidemics. While national drug epidemics are considered rare, local areas frequently experience emerging drug crises before they spread. Federal agencies, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), fund various programs to implement the nation's drug control strategy, with about two-thirds of the funding aimed at reducing drug supply and the remainder at reducing demand.
2. The Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 established the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to oversee drug research, prevention, and treatment, including the creation of a national community-based treatment system. The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services (ADAMHA) was later reorganized into SAMHSA, which took over service programs and some drug use detection functions. NIDA and SAMHSA have been instrumental in detecting changes in drug use patterns, such as the shift from snorting to smoking cocaine, which was associated with the crack epidemic. However, limitations in the data collection mechanisms used by NIDA and other agencies hindered the timely and accurate measurement of crack use in the general population.
3. The federal response to the crack crisis primarily focused on cocaine in general, with NIDA researching prevention and treatment approaches without initially distinguishing between powdered cocaine and crack. Public education campaigns were launched, but the lack of specific data on crack use delayed the implementation of targeted prevention and treatment strategies. The ADMS block grant program, consolidated in 1982, limited federal involvement in service delivery, shifting more responsibility to states.

The Medicare subvention demonstration, which allowed military retirees aged 65 or older to receive Medicare benefits and additional TRICARE benefits, resulted in higher utilization and costs for the Department of Defense (DOD), which had to cover the shortfall with appropriated health care funds. The demonstration's impact on total federal costs for the demonstration population was negligible, but DOD's costs per enrollee were over 80 percent higher than the Senior Prime capitation rate.
2. The demonstration also led to a complex payment mechanism, with Medicare not paying DOD for Senior Prime care provided in 1999 due to the rules set by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The rules required DOD to spend as much as it had historically on all seniors in the demonstration areas before it could be paid by Medicare, and adjustments were made based on the health status of enrollees compared to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.

The Department of Defense (DOD) has shifted its Corporate Information Management (CIM) implementation strategy to focus on selecting and implementing standard information systems across all functional areas, a move that has raised concerns about potential delays in improving logistics processes and the possibility of deploying systems that do not meet operational requirements. The strategy, which diverges from expert advice on prioritizing business process reengineering, aims to achieve quick cost recoveries and establish a common business environment for reengineering business processes. However, the accelerated timeline for selecting and deploying these systems, coupled with the lack of flexibility in the schedule, poses risks of not meeting the needs of the services and DLA. Additionally, the initiative's focus on information systems over business process improvements has led to a lack of acceptance among DOD managers, who view the changes as a threat to their authority. To address these issues, the DOD has taken steps to integrate CIM efforts and improve management strategies, but more needs to be done to ensure active participation from functional managers and build employee support for the cultural changes required for CIM's success.

Wholesalers purchase drugs in bulk and distribute them to pharmacies, including independent pharmacies, which are retail pharmacies with store-based locations often in rural and underserved areas. Independent pharmacies, which accounted for about 34 percent of retail pharmacies in 2010, primarily purchase drugs from wholesalers and provide patient-care services.
2. PSAOs, which represent a significant portion of independent pharmacies, offer a range of services to these pharmacies, including contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services. These services are intended to achieve administrative efficiencies for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs. PSAOs negotiate contracts on behalf of member pharmacies, which can affect the financial viability of independent pharmacies due to the contractual terms set by third-party payers or their PBMs.

1. The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (FTA), concluded in 2005 and signed in 2006, is the fifth U.S. bilateral FTA in the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA), which includes 16 entities in the Middle East and four in North Africa. The FTA aims to support Middle East economic growth and democracy through trade, with completion proposed by 2013.
2. Oman, a small exporter of oil and natural gas with strategic geographic location, seeks to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas exports and views the U.S. as a key ally in this endeavor. The U.S.-Oman FTA includes new tariff schedules, market openness commitments, and labor and environmental protections, with the U.S. having a small trade surplus with Oman in 2005.
3. The FTA is similar to other MEFTA FTAs, with provisions for duty-free access for consumer and industrial goods, phased tariff reductions for agricultural and textile products, and protections for U.S. investors and intellectual property rights. It also includes commitments to open markets in sectors like banking, insurance, and telecommunications, and transparent customs procedures.
4. The U.S. Trade Representative asserts that the FTA will contribute to economic growth, trade, job creation, and consumer benefits, while also providing a secure legal framework for U.S. investors and effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws.
5. Despite broad support, the FTA has faced criticism from labor groups and environmental advisory committees, with concerns about the enforceability of labor provisions and the potential for Oman to weaken labor laws to attract trade and investment. The U.S. has also faced scrutiny over the security implications of the FTA's provisions related to port operations.

1. Hate crimes, defined as offenses motivated by bias against race, religion, disability, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, have gained significant attention from policymakers, leading to the enactment of various laws, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which expanded the definition of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.
2. The Act also broadens the federal government's jurisdiction over hate crimes, but its constitutionality under the commerce clause is questioned due to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Morrison, which limited Congress's power to regulate non-economic, violent conduct based on its aggregate effect on interstate commerce.
3. The commerce clause allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce, including activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, but the Morrison decision restricts this power to cases with a clear and substantial relation to interstate commerce.
4. The 14th Amendment's Section 5 grants Congress the power to enforce its provisions through appropriate legislation, but it primarily addresses state action, not private conduct, limiting its application to state-sponsored discrimination or denial of equal protection or due process.
5. The 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, may provide a broader basis for hate crime legislation, as it empowers Congress to define and punish the badges and incidents of slavery, potentially encompassing hate crimes motivated by bigotry.
6. However, the extent to which Congress can use the 13th Amendment to criminalize hate crimes based on religion, national origin, or other factors remains unclear, as the Court has not yet addressed whether such violence constitutes a ""badge or incident of slavery.""
7. The 14th Amendment's due process clause also restricts states from enacting laws that punish speech, thought, or expression, but it allows for sentence enhancement based on a defendant's conduct, as seen in Wisconsin v. Mitchell.

1. The exchange rate policies of East Asian nations, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, have historically caused tensions with the United States due to allegations of currency manipulation to maintain export competitiveness, with the U.S. Treasury required to analyze and report on these policies, identifying six major trading partners on a ""Monitoring List"" for their exchange rate practices.
2. East Asian countries have adopted various exchange rate policies ranging from ""fixed"" or ""pegged"" rates, like Hong Kong's linked exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, to ""free float"" policies, like Japan's yen, to ""managed float"" policies, where intervention occurs based on economic indicators, with each approach having its own advantages and disadvantages.
3. Despite the U.S. generally favoring ""free float"" policies, East Asian governments often prefer ""managed float"" policies for greater economic stability, and the impact of these policies on U.S. trade deficits remains a subject of debate, with proposals like the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act considering countermeasures for undervalued currencies.

The role of U.S. ambassadors as Chiefs of Mission (COMs) in foreign countries is crucial for U.S. diplomacy, with responsibilities including coordination of interagency activities and control over U.S. forces, as highlighted by the State Department and USAID's 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR).
2. The U.S. Constitution authorizes the President to appoint ambassadors with Senate consent, and in their absence, a career U.S. foreign service officer can be appointed as a chargé d'affaires.
3. COMs, led by ambassadors, are the President's personal representatives and are responsible for overseeing U.S. government activities in their host countries, except for military operations.
4. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (FSA 1980) and executive branch directives, such as Presidential Letters of Instruction, outline the scope of COM authority, which includes responsibility for government employees, coordination of agency activities, and ensuring compliance with COM directives.
5. COM authority extends to all Department of Defense (DOD) personnel except those under the command of a geographic combatant commander (GCC), and COMs are responsible for military personnel in their country of assignment.
6. In countries without a U.S. embassy or diplomatic presence, COMs still exercise authority over U.S. government activities and diplomatic relations, as seen with the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba and the U.S. Interests Section of the Czech Republic's Damascus embassy.

1. China's economy, heavily reliant on global trade and investment, experienced a significant slowdown in 2008 and early 2009 due to the global economic crisis, with a sharp decline in exports, FDI, and GDP growth. The government responded with a $586 billion stimulus package focusing on infrastructure, healthcare, and rural development, aiming to stimulate growth and rebalance the economy towards domestic consumption. Despite these efforts, concerns persist about the sustainability of growth, the potential for increased non-performing loans, and the long-term impact of current policies on economic reform.
2. China's large foreign exchange reserves and investments in U.S. securities present both opportunities and challenges for its role in the global financial crisis. While there is speculation about China potentially buying U.S. assets to stabilize its economy and support the U.S., there are concerns about the long-term benefits for China and the implications of such investments on its political influence and economic reforms. The country's cautious approach to reserve management and reluctance to fully embrace market-oriented reforms may affect its future economic growth and international economic relations.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service, under the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture respectively, manage federal lands and oversee the leasing and permitting of oil and gas development on public domain lands, with specific statutes and regulations governing these activities. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (MLLA) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits on public domain lands, subject to certain exclusions and conditions, and requires leases to be consistent with Resource Management Plans (RMPs) that consider multiple use and sustained yield principles. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) introduced changes to streamline and expedite oil and gas development processes, including provisions for a memorandum of understanding between the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, a Federal Permit Streamlining Pilot Project, and a rebuttable presumption for categorical exclusions under NEPA for certain oil and gas exploration and development activities.

2. Judicial and administrative decisions have addressed compliance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in the context of coalbed methane (CBM) development, with courts and the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) ruling on the adequacy of environmental reviews and the necessity of considering alternative leasing options and cumulative impacts. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the IBLA's decision that BLM's actions were supported by evidence and did not violate NEPA, while other cases have highlighted the need for thorough environmental impact assessments and consideration of alternative development strategies.

2. In 2014, 30% of tax filers itemized deductions, with higher-income individuals more likely to itemize than lower-income individuals.
3. Higher-income tax filers claimed larger average sums of itemized deductions, with the share of itemizers and average deduction amounts increasing significantly for those with AGI over $200,000.
4. Specific deductions varied by income, with higher-income tax filers claiming deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes at higher rates than lower-income tax filers.
5. The largest tax expenditures in FY2018 were projected to be for state and local income or sales taxes, followed by home mortgage interest, charitable gifts, and real estate taxes.

2. If a project could harm a listed species, a jeopardy opinion is issued along with reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to avoid such harm. Incidental take statements with RPMs are issued for unavoidable impacts.
3. Exemptions from the ESA are rare and only granted under extraordinary circumstances, with the exemption process allowing consideration of economic factors and the opportunity to avoid species jeopardy.
4. The exemption process involves a review by the Endangered Species Committee (ESC), which requires a majority vote and considers factors such as the lack of reasonable alternatives, the benefits of the action, its significance, and the absence of irreversible resource commitments.
5. Exemptions are specific to actions, not species, and the ESC must ensure that affected species are conserved in their remaining habitat.
6. The exemption process is complex, potentially lengthy, and costly, with the burden of mitigation measures falling on the applicant, who must report on compliance annually.
7. Despite the process, exemptions are seldom sought due to the stringent requirements, the potential for legal challenges, and the availability of other avenues for modifying actions to avoid harm to species during the consultation process.

2. The asymmetrical treatment of capital gains and losses, where long-term gains are taxed at a maximum of 15% and losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to $3,000, allows taxpayers to time their gains and losses to minimize taxes, potentially undermining tax revenue.
3. Historical legislative changes to capital loss treatment have aimed to balance the taxation of gains and losses, but recent changes have not addressed the growing asymmetry, and increasing the loss limit could exacerbate this issue by encouraging taxpayers to time the realization of gains and losses to reduce tax liabilities.

1. The United States has seen fluctuating import levels of milk protein concentrates (MPCs) and casein/caseinates, with a notable decline in 2009 due to weak demand, following a period of convergence between world and domestic milk prices in 2001. MPCs, containing both casein and whey protein, are used in various food products and have been subject to limited import restrictions, unlike other dairy products which face tariff-rate quotas.
2. Proposals to impose new import barriers on MPCs have been made to protect domestic dairy farmers from the unlimited importation of milk protein, which could potentially lower milk prices. However, such measures could increase costs for food manufacturers and lead to higher retail prices. Major suppliers of MPCs, like New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union, may seek compensation under WTO rules if the U.S. imposes new restrictions.
3. The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act (S. 1542) was introduced to limit MPC imports by establishing two separate tariff rate quotas (TRQs), with the potential to affect over half of the annual trade in MPCs and casein/caseinates. The legislation could lead to compensation negotiations with major suppliers under WTO rules, and the impact on U.S. dairy farmers would depend on the balance between the quantity of imports affected by the TRQs and overall U.S. milk production.

1. The Supreme Court decided four search and seizure cases during its October 2012 term, including Florida v. Jardines, which questioned whether a trained narcotics-detection dog's sniff at a house's front door constitutes a Fourth Amendment search.
2. Florida v. Jardines involved a trained drug-sniffing dog alerting at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house, leading to a search warrant and the discovery of marijuana.
3. The Florida Supreme Court initially reversed the district court's decision, ruling that the dog sniff constituted a warrantless search, but the U.S. Supreme Court later reversed this decision.
4. The U.S. Supreme Court held that a dog sniff at the front door of a private residence is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause, distinguishing it from previous cases where dog sniffs were considered less intrusive.
5. The Court emphasized that the Jardines sniff test was a ""public spectacle"" at a private home, unlike the minimally intrusive tests in Place, Edmond, and Caballes.
6. The Court stated that the use of a drug-sniffing dog at a private residence without prior evidence of wrongdoing could lead to arbitrary or discriminatory application, unlike the public areas in previous cases.
7. The majority opinion in Jardines was based on the principle that a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government physically intrudes upon constitutionally protected areas, as established in Jones.
8. The Court rejected the notion that the officer's presence at Jardines's front door became a search simply because he was accompanied by his dog.
9. The Court also addressed the issue of probable cause in Harris v. Florida, refusing to accept a trained drug-detection dog's positive reaction as per se probable cause.

1. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) focuses on modernizing and securing the nation's electric grid, supporting a more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient energy infrastructure. OE's mission includes research and development (R&D), demonstration projects, partnerships, modeling and analytics, and emergency preparedness and response, with a significant portion of its funding dedicated to R&D.
2. OE's funding has historically been lower than that for energy technology programs, but received a substantial boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which allocated $4.5 billion for grid modernization, primarily for smart grid technologies.
3. The FY2017 OE budget request aimed to support the Obama Administration's ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy, emphasizing grid resilience and cybersecurity, with proposed increases for Energy Storage, State Distribution-Level Reform, State Energy Assurance, and the creation of a Grid Institute, while proposing cuts to the Cybersecurity program.
4. OE's programs are aligned with the DOE's Quadrennial Technology Review and Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan, which outline the need for a more flexible, agile, and dynamic grid that can optimize operations in real-time and integrate new technologies and end-use demands.
5. OE's funding and program priorities have been subject to congressional oversight and appropriations, with the FY2017 E&W bill ultimately providing $206 million for OE, the same amount as the FY2016 appropriation, and the continuation of funding through a second continuing resolution.

2. HRPs target individuals who have been denied coverage, received high quotes, or were offered plans excluding preexisting conditions, and comply with HIPAA's portability and guaranteed availability provisions.
3. State-established HRPs enrolled approximately 200,000 individuals in 2008, while nearly 4 million were potentially eligible, reflecting the narrow focus of these pools.
4. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a temporary high risk pool program before 2014 for individuals with preexisting conditions who have been uninsured for six or more months.
5. HRPs serve as a safety net for the nongroup market, ensuring access to health insurance for those willing and able to pay.
6. Supporters argue that HRPs help stabilize the private market, promote competition, and make individual market coverage more affordable by removing high-risk individuals from it.
7. Critics contend that HRPs are too small and underfunded to meet the needs of most uninsured individuals, and that federal subsidies have been limited.
8. State HRPs typically cap premiums between 150% and 200% of standard risk rates and operate at a loss due to the high costs of covering individuals with costly medical conditions.
9. States fund HRPs through various sources, including assessments on insurers, general revenue, and federal grants.

1. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), established in 1951, is a joint DOD and DOT program that provides strategic airlift support during emergencies when DOD's organic fleet is insufficient. CRAF carriers, which must be U.S. certified and meet FAA regulations, commit a portion of their fleets to the program, with AMC monitoring compliance and performance. The CRAF is activated in three stages depending on the crisis's severity, with carrier response times of 24 to 48 hours. The program has been activated twice, notably during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and as of March 2008, 35 carriers with 1,262 aircraft were enrolled. CRAF offers cost benefits to DOD by supplementing its organic fleet without the need for additional purchases or maintenance during peacetime. However, it has operational limitations compared to military aircraft and incurs costs upon activation. Recent events, such as increased commercial airline use for troop movements and the ""Commercial and Government Air Program,"" suggest a growing reliance on commercial airlift, which could impact CRAF's future. Legislation like the FY2008 NDAA mandates assessments of CRAF's viability and a study on the optimal size and mix of airlift assets, considering the CRAF's role.

2. The CRAF program has been formally activated twice, with significant contributions during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. It consists of international, national, and aeromedical evacuation segments, with commercial airlines contractually committing aircraft to these segments. The program's cost-effectiveness is highlighted by the minimal expense of activating CRAF compared to maintaining a larger military fleet. However, the program faces challenges such as operational limitations of commercial aircraft and the potential for increased reliance on commercial airlift due to economic pressures on the airline industry. Legislation like the FY2008 NDAA requires an independent assessment of CRAF's viability and a study on the size and mix of airlift assets, considering the CRA",1

3. The Secretary of Homeland Security used administrative enforcement discretion in 2012 to delay certain immigration enforcement actions against young individuals who entered the U.S. as children, which opponents argue contravenes statutory mandates requiring detainment for removal proceedings.
4. The Administration delayed the enforcement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provisions, including the employer mandate and minimum coverage requirements, citing enforcement discretion, which Congress has questioned as upsetting the separation of powers and violating the President's constitutional duty to enforce laws.
5. The judicial branch traditionally does not review discretionary enforcement decisions, including the decision to initiate criminal or administrative actions, due to the Take Care Clause, which is interpreted as both an obligation and a source of Presidential control over law enforcement.
6. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the President has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend or disregard laws enacted by Congress, and that the President's role in law enforcement is limited to executing laws faithfully, with the judiciary only intervening when there is a clear statutory mandate or prohibition.

The U.S. poverty rate in 2013 was 14.5%, a decrease from 15.0% in 2012, marking the first statistically significant drop since 2006, with 45.3 million people estimated below the poverty line, unchanged from 2012. Poverty rates closely follow the economic cycle, increasing during recessions and decreasing during periods of growth. The most recent recession ended in June 2009, and despite a falling unemployment rate, poverty has remained above pre-recession levels. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) released in 2014 suggests poverty levels may continue to fall in 2014.
2. The SPM reveals different poverty rates among age groups, with a higher rate for adults (15.4%) and a lower rate for children (16.4%) compared to the ""official"" measure (13.6% and 20.4%, respectively). The SPM also shows a higher poverty rate for the elderly (14.6%) compared to the ""official"" measure (9.5%). The SPM attributes the higher poverty rate among the elderly to medical expenses, highlighting the economic vulnerability of this group.
3. The SPM includes a broader range of income and resources, such as in-kind benefits and tax credits, and subtracts necessary expenses like medical out-of-pocket costs, resulting in different poverty estimates compared to the ""official"" measure. The SPM indicates that work-based supports and in-kind benefits like SNAP are crucial in reducing child poverty, and it captures the policy effects of these supports more effectively than the ""official"" measure.

These aliens may be summarily removed without a hearing or further review unless they express a fear of persecution or claim to be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, admitted refugee, or asylee. The INA also allows the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand the use of expedited removal to aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled if they have been in the country less than two years and do not have valid entry documents or have attempted to gain their admission by fraud or misrepresentation.
2. The Supreme Court has held that aliens seeking initial entry are entitled only to procedural protections that Congress expressly authorized, while aliens physically present in the United States are generally entitled to due process protections prior to removal. However, the extent to which the entry fiction doctrine may apply to aliens already within the United States remains unclear, and the courts have largely dismissed challenges to the expedited removal process due to jurisdictional limitations.

1. The Supreme Court has established that congressional redistricting must adhere to the ""one person, one vote"" standard, requiring districts to have approximately equal populations, with some allowable deviations for legitimate state objectives. The Court has also ruled that states may draw districts based on total population rather than eligible voters, and that partisanship cannot justify significant population disparities between districts.
2. The Court has addressed the application of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) to congressional redistricting, requiring districts to be drawn in a manner that does not dilute minority voting power. The Supreme Court has also clarified the requirements for creating majority-minority districts under the VRA and the Fourteenth Amendment, emphasizing the need for a compelling state interest and narrow tailoring in cases where race is the predominant factor in redistricting.
3. Recent and pending Supreme Court cases continue to shape congressional redistricting, with decisions on the permissible role of partisanship in redistricting, the use of race in redistricting plans, and the authority of states to establish independent redistricting commissions. Legislation in Congress also proposes additional requirements and standards for congressional redistricting, such as limiting the number of redistricting cycles and mandating the use of independent commissions.

1. The U.S. has seen an increase in severe wildfire seasons since 2000, leading to substantial federal funding for fire protection programs, with total wildfire funding reaching a record high of $4.46 billion in FY2008. The funding is allocated across three categories: protection of federal lands, assistance for non-federal lands, and other fire-related expenditures. Federal programs focus on protecting federal lands managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (FS) and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), with a history of aggressive fire control policies that have been questioned for their ecological impacts and cost-efficiency. The FS and DOI use three fire appropriation accounts—preparedness, suppression operations, and other operations—to fund most federal fire programs, with significant fluctuations in suppression funding and a recent trend of reduced suppression appropriations. The Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) Act established FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Accounts to insulate other agency programs from high suppression costs. Assistance for non-federal lands includes state and local government support, with funding levels fluctuating and showing a recent downward trend. Other fire-related expenditures cover research, fire facilities, and forest health management, with a recent focus on post-fire rehabilitation and the potential for federal wildfire insurance.

2. Issues related to high wildfire costs include the need for state and local responsibility for fire protection, better fuel reduction efforts, and improved cost accountability. The FLAME Act aims to mitigate the financial impact of wildfire suppression on federal land management programs, but does not address the broader issue of cost containment or the effectiveness of suppression efforts. The FS and DOI have been criticized for their fire management strategies, with calls for a cohesive strategy and better performance measures. The high costs of wildfire management have also raised concerns about the impact on other agency programs and the need for a more sustainable approach to fire suppression and forest management.

1. As of now, approximately 27.5 million state and local government employees in the U.S., or about 27.5% of the total, work in positions not covered by Social Security, with coverage rates varying significantly across states.
2. Social Security coverage for state and local government employees is extended through ""Section 218 Agreements"" between states and the Social Security Administration (SSA), which detail the positions covered by Social Security and Medicare, and are administered by a designated State Social Security Administrator.
3. Coverage under Section 218 Agreements is not individual-based but rather applies to groups of employee positions known as ""coverage groups,"" and once provided, it generally cannot be terminated, requiring all future employees in covered positions to participate in Social Security.
4. Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all state and local government employees have been part of the policy debate for years, with potential advantages including increased universality of the program, better retirement, survivor, and disability insurance protections, and improved benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between different types of employment.
5. However, mandatory Social Security coverage could also lead to potential disadvantages, such as reduced pension benefits, higher payroll taxes, and lower replacement rates for higher-wage workers, as well as administrative burdens for state and local governments.
6. The long-range financial status of the Social Security system, benefit protections for workers and their families, the impact on states and localities, and a broader social perspective are all factors to consider in evaluating the potential advantages and disadvantages of mandatory Social Security coverage for state and local government employees.

1. Transnational organized crime in Burma, involving drugs, humans, guns, wildlife, gems, and timber, is highly profitable and facilitated by corruption within the SPDC, with an estimated annual turnover of several billion dollars. The country's challenging terrain and ethnic tensions contribute to its status as an ""ungoverned space,"" where various criminal networks operate with relative impunity.
2. U.S. policy towards Burma has been influenced by concerns over transnational crime, leading to sanctions and restrictions on foreign assistance, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008, which targeted SPDC officials and the gem trade.
3. Despite U.S. efforts to engage Burma on international crime issues, the country remains a major drug-producing state and a source of trafficking, with organized crime groups like the UWSA and ethnic armed groups maintaining criminal networks that span the region. The SPDC's collusion with these groups, often to co-opt ethnic groups, has led to a situation where organized crime's influence is difficult to diminish.
4. Burma's sanctions and the international community's efforts to combat transnational crime have had limited success, with sanctions being unevenly applied and the country's natural gas industry providing the SPDC with significant revenue.

Legislative commemoratives include naming federal buildings, creating postage stamps, minting coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, establishing monuments and memorials, designating observances, and requesting presidential proclamations, all requiring passage of bills or resolutions by Congress.
3. Nonlegislative commemoratives involve sending certificates of recognition, making floor speeches, and ordering flags flown over the Capitol, which can be done without legislative approval.
4. Initiatives to reduce legislative commemoratives began in the 1960s, with proposals to shift the responsibility of recommending commemorations to a presidential commission and amendments to congressional rules to limit commemorative legislation.
5. House Rule XII, clause 5, prohibits the introduction and consideration of commemorative legislation, while Senate rules have similar restrictions, with waivers possible under certain conditions.
6. Commemorative options are categorized into those requiring legislation, such as naming federal buildings and creating holidays, and nonlegislative options, like sending certificates of recognition and making floor speeches.

1. President Obama signed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (COMPETES 2010) on January 4, 2011, to enhance U.S. competitiveness by increasing federal funding for research in physical sciences and engineering, STEM education, and related programs, with provisions set to expire at the end of FY2013.
2. COMPETES 2010 authorized approximately $45.5 billion in funding between FY2010 and FY2013, including increased funding for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, and new programs like the Regional Innovation Program (RIP) and inducement prizes.
3. The FY2013 budget request by the Obama Administration generally aligned with prior requests and appropriations, with increased funding for doubling path accounts at NSF and NIST but limited support for COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs, excluding the RIP.
4. The FY2013 budget request included funding for a green chemistry program at NSF and the Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering and Materials (SusCHEM) program, as well as a focus on the ""OneNSF Framework"" and the ""100Kin10"" initiative for STEM graduates and teachers.
5. The FY2013 budget request for the DOE Office of Science was $4.992 billion, with a request for $350 million for the ARPA-E account, and the President did not seek funding for the SCGF program.
6. Congressional appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies in FY2013 were provided through two sequential acts, with funding levels generally below FY2010 levels due to sequestration and rescissions, leading to a widened gap between authorizations and appropriations.

1. The Lacey Act, originally enacted in 1900, regulates the trade of wildlife and plants, imposing penalties for violations such as illegal import, export, and sale of wildlife and plants, and falsifying documents related to plant trade. The 2008 amendments expanded the Act's scope to include nonindigenous plants and violations of foreign laws concerning plant conservation, requiring importers to submit detailed import declarations to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and to pay appropriate royalties, taxes, or stumpage fees.
2. The 2008 amendments aim to reduce illegal logging, which is estimated to account for 15%-30% of global forestry and costs governments $15 billion annually. The Act's implementation has faced challenges, including concerns over the complexity of declaration requirements and the burden on importers, with some suggesting that the Act overreaches by addressing laws not directly related to conservation.
3. Policy issues and legislative options have emerged, with proposals to amend the Act to provide more flexibility for importers, exempt certain plant products, and clarify the applicability of the Act to imported goods. The 113th Congress has considered legislation to address these issues, including H.R. 3324 and H.R. 3280, which propose changes to declaration requirements and exemptions for certain plant products.
4. The Act's enforcement relies on the Secretaries of the Interior, Commerce, and Agriculture, as well as other federal agencies, with penalties for violations including fines, forfeiture, and imprisonment. The Act does not provide funding for implementation, but funds can be identified in the Department of the Interior's budget proposal. The Act also allows for the use of penalties and fines to support its enforcement and rewards for information leading to violations.

1. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002 provides new long-term counter-cyclical support for major commodities like grains, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, and milk, by restoring target prices and deficiency payments, and replacing annual PFC payments with fixed, ""direct payments"" to farmers. It also maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments with changes in most loan rates, and redesigns peanut support to operate like that for grains, oilseeds, and cotton.
2. The FSRIA's commodity support provisions are estimated to cost $98.9 billion over 6 years, with $23.6 billion for grains, cotton, and oilseeds, and $904 million for peanuts, and $963 million for dairy. The new counter-cyclical aid focuses on major commodities, potentially leaving much of U.S. agriculture ineligible for such payments, raising questions of equity and the potential for distorting production toward items that might receive more support.

1. The study compared the effects of repetitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) analysis with additional protein prefractionation on proteome coverage and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates. It was found that an additional protein-level fractionation step using microsolution isoelectrofocusing (microsol ief) prior to gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (gelc-ms/ms) significantly increased proteome coverage and sequence coverage of low-abundance proteins compared to repetitive lc-ms/ms analysis without additional fractionation.
2. The study also demonstrated high reproducibility between the two methods, with over 90% of proteins identified in one analysis being reproducibly detected in subsequent analyses. Most apparent differences in protein identifications were due to limitations of current sequence databases and software for filtering database search results and building consensus protein lists.

1. The study compared the incidence of secondary or delayed postoperative hemorrhage after tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (smuppp) in adult patients, finding a statistically significant lower rate of hemorrhage in the smuppp group (1.45%) compared to the tonsillectomy group (5.05%).
2. The tonsillectomy technique used in both groups was identical, performed with unipolar electrocautery, and the tonsillar fossae were left intact for secondary healing.
3. The only influencing factor detected that may have lowered the bleeding incidence was the suturing of the tonsillar pillars, which is unique to the smuppp technique.
4. The study suggests that routine use of the suturing technique for smuppp in all tonsillectomy patients could help reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage, as it appears to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding.

1. The study investigated the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the invasion and development of breast cancer, focusing on mir-125a, mir-206, mir-145, mir-21, and mir-10b. The research found that mir-145 and mir-206 were negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis, suggesting their potential as tumor suppressors. Conversely, mir-21 and mir-10b were overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and related to tumor progression and metastasis. These findings indicate that mir-145, mir-125a, and mir-206 could serve as novel tumor markers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis, while mir-21 and mir-10b may contribute to the development of breast cancer and could be targets for treatment.
2. The study also suggested that mir-145 and mir-206 might inhibit the expression of the top 2a gene, which is related to anthracycline drug resistance, and could be important in guiding the development of chemotherapy for breast cancer. However, further research is needed to verify the detailed mechanisms and clinical applications of these miRNAs.

1. Endothelial cells were stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 and the supernatant was used to characterize and quantify emphysematous particles ( emps) using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy ( tem).
2. The emps were introduced to an IV bag simulating a patient's circulation and mixed with a standard clinical CVVH circuit.
3. Emp levels in the IV bag were measured over time, showing rapid clearance with 50% reduction in the first 30 minutes and a plateau at 29% of starting concentration after 40 minutes.
4. Dialysate samples were analyzed to measure the fraction of emps removed from the circulation, revealing a final concentration of 5.7% of the original emps concentration.
5. The study suggests that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter and under clinical conditions can remove emps from a patient's circulation.
6. The observed emps clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, which would explain the plateauing emp concentration and low dialysate emp levels.
7. The relative volume of human circulation to CVVH circuit in the clinical condition is much higher than the model used in the study, which may affect the steady state of emps.
8. Emp interactions with plasma oncotic elements were not modeled in the study, but the absence of these elements in the model is representative of the steady state of unbound plasma emps present in human disease.
9. The findings support the idea of CVVH as a meaningful therapeutic intervention in emphysema-induced acute lung injury ( EILI) due to clearance of emps from the patient circulation.

1. The study demonstrated that sublingual nitroglycerin spray significantly increases time to onset of moderate angina during exercise in patients with stable angina, with the greatest effect observed at the highest dose of 1.6 mg. This improvement in exercise tolerance may allow patients to engage in physical activity with greater confidence and for longer durations, potentially enhancing their quality of life.
2. Sublingual nitroglycerin spray was generally well tolerated, with a dose-dependent increase in treatment-related adverse events, primarily headache, which were mild to moderate in severity. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.
3. The findings support the use of sublingual nitroglycerin spray as part of optimal medical therapy for patients with stable angina, and may also benefit those with persistent angina post-revascularization. Further long-term studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of routine prophylactic nitroglycerin spray in increasing exercise duration and improving quality of life for patients with stable angina.

2. Candida albicans, a dentinophilic microorganism, can invade dentin and may remain in the root canal system due to its ability to survive in harsh conditions and resistance to intracanalicular medications.
3. If endodontic treatments fail or are unfeasible, root-end resection is the alternative, with success influenced by the antibacterial and antifungal properties of root-end filling materials.
4. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), introduced in 1993, is a gold standard root-end filling material with various advantages, including antimicrobial effects.
5. MTA-angelus, a variant of MTA, has been reported to have good marginal adaptation, sealing ability, and strong antifungal effects against Candida albicans.
6. The study aimed to compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set MTA and MTA-angelus against Candida albicans at different concentrations and time points.
7. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the in vitro antifungal properties of the two materials.
8. The study used a tube-dilution test, which allowed direct contact between Candida albicans and the materials, providing a more realistic interaction.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a prevalence of approximately 0.5% in Italy, with a higher prevalence in women and increasing with age. The prevalence and incidence of RA are expected to rise in Italy due to the aging population.
2. The economic burden of RA in Italy has been significant, with direct medical costs accounting for a substantial part of the total costs. The introduction of biological agents has increased direct medical costs but also improved disease activity and quality of life, potentially reducing long-term healthcare costs.
3. The economic impact of RA in Italy is expected to increase in the coming years, with costs projected to rise from 3.3 billion to 4 billion annually by 2029. This increase is due to the aging population and the progression of the disease, which leads to higher indirect costs such as loss of productivity and informal care.
4. The use of biological agents in the treatment of RA has been associated with improved outcomes and reduced progression of the disease, which may offset some of the direct costs. However, the long-term economic impact of these treatments needs further research to fully understand their cost-effectiveness and potential to reduce indirect costs.

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) is a significant global health concern, particularly in developing countries, with limited therapeutic options due to its resistance to chemotherapy and the complexity of its molecular pathogenesis involving multiple pathways. The hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) and its receptor, c-Met, play a critical role in HCC development and progression, making the HGF-cMet axis a promising therapeutic target. Clinical trials have shown that inhibitors of the c-Met signaling pathway, such as tivantinib and cabozantinib, can improve progression-free survival in HCC patients. However, the challenge remains to identify which subsets of HCC tumors are most likely to benefit from these therapies, necessitating the development of predictive biomarkers and companion diagnostics.
2. The future of HCC treatment may involve combination therapies targeting multiple pathways and the use of innovative clinical trial designs to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve patient outcomes.

2. The tumor has been associated with osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia, with some cases considered a precursor lesion to adamantinoma.
3. The most common site of metastasis for tibial adamantinoma is the lungs, with inguinal lymph node metastases being rare and poorly documented in the literature.
4. Two cases are reported, one with inguinal lymph node metastasis initially misdiagnosed as cutaneous eccrine carcinoma, and another with a history of tibial adamantinoma presenting with a fibrous dysplasia-like lesion.
5. The cases highlight the importance of considering adamantinoma in the differential diagnosis of bone lesions, especially in patients with a history of bone tumors and unusual metastatic patterns.
6. The authors recommend long-term follow-up for patients with tibial adamantinoma due to its slow-growing nature and potential for late metastasis, emphasizing the need for awareness of this rare neoplasm and its atypical metastatic presentations.

3. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures, with a wide bandgap, are suitable for AR layers as they do not absorb sunlight themselves.
4. ZnO nanorod arrays have demonstrated superior antireflective properties compared to other oxide compounds.
5. A two-step seeding and growth process using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine in aqueous solutions is a cost-effective and scalable method for fabricating ZnO nanowhiskers (NWs).
6. ZnO NWs can be grown on silicon solar cells with controlled density and length by optimizing the growth time.
7. The integration of ZnO NWs into Czochralski (Cz) silicon solar cells has shown a 3% efficiency improvement in practical applications.
8. The ZnO NWs reduce the solar cell reflectivity across a broad wavelength range and enhance the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the corresponding range.
9. Solar cells with ZnO NWs grown for 30 and 45 minutes show improved EQEs and short-circuit current densities (Jsc) compared to the reference cell.

2. Molecular imaging techniques using dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and myocardial meta-[i]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy have improved diagnostic accuracy for PD and other parkinsonian syndromes (non-PD).
3. DAT imaging with [123I]-FP-CIT successfully visualizes presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration but cannot differentiate between PD and non-PD with sufficient accuracy alone.
4. MIBG myocardial scintigraphy assesses sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals, showing decreased uptake in PD patients compared to non-PD patients.
5. A retrospective study compared DAT scintigraphy and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy results with clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes.
6. The study found that combining DAT scintigraphy and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy improved diagnostic accuracy for differentiating PD from non-PD to 79.4%.
7. The combined use of DAT scintigraphy and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy showed a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 73.7% for differentiating PD from non-PD.
8. The study suggests that the combination of DAT scintigraphy and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy can be used in clinical practice to improve the diagnostic accuracy for PD, using commercially available radiotracers without the need for short-lived PET tracers.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins, with cardiac troponin T (Tnnt2) mutations accounting for approximately 15% of familial HCM cases.
2. Genetic analysis in 173 Japanese patients with familial HCM identified three reported mutations and a new Tnnt2 mutation in 11 individuals from four families.
3. The proband and her elder brother, who carried the double reported mutations (arg130cys and phe110ile), showed mild HCM with sinus rhythm and complete atrioventricular block, while her mother and father, with arg130cys and phe110ile mutations respectively, showed no abnormal clinical features.
4. In family b, three members with HCM showed apical hypertrophy and aneurysm, while the proband and her family members, with an arg92trp mutation, showed mild HCM with no sudden deaths.
5. In family c, the proband and her family members, with an arg92trp mutation, showed mild HCM with gradual myocardial hypertrophy and no sudden deaths, while the mother had a suspected shift to the dilated phase.
6. In family d, a 5-bp deletion/deletion polymorphism in intron 3 of Tnnt2 was found, and patients with this polymorphism showed a stronger tendency toward hypertrophy, with two patients diagnosed with apical HCM and no sudden deaths.

1. The sequencing of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of several schistosoma species has provided a wealth of data for comparative analyses, enhancing our understanding of schistosome biology and evolution. The availability of these genomic resources has facilitated the identification of genetic loci related to host specificity, virulence, and drug resistance, and has also enabled the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
2. Transcriptomic studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of schistosome gene expression and regulation, revealing the complexity of the parasite's interaction with its hosts and environment. These studies have identified potential vaccine and drug targets, and have improved our understanding of the parasite's life cycle and development.
3. Despite the progress made in genomics and transcriptomics, challenges remain in the functional characterization of genes and the development of effective tools for schistosomiasis control. Future research should focus on integrating and interpreting the vast amount of data generated, and on addressing the limitations of current methodologies to further improve our understanding of schistosome biology and evolution.

1. A retrospective study was conducted to determine predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sclm), comparing the outcomes with those of patients who underwent hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastasis or only resection for colorectal cancer.
2. The study included 86 patients who underwent simultaneous resection for sclm between 1992 and 2004, with a 61% 3-year survival rate and a 45% 5-year survival rate. The morbidity rate was 64%, with anastomotic leakage occurring in 21% of patients.
3. Predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage were identified as operation time greater than 8 hours and intraoperative blood loss. Patients with operation time over 8 hours had a 91% morbidity rate and a 50% anastomotic leakage rate, compared to 54% and 13% in patients with operation time less than or equal to 8 hours.
4. The study suggests that staged resections should be considered for patients with sclm when the simultaneous resection would involve excessive surgical stress, as indicated by operation time greater than 8 hours. Further prospective studies are needed to compare the efficacy of simultaneous versus staged resections in sclm patients.

1. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects daily activities, and correct inhaler technique is crucial for effective treatment.
2. Only half of asthma patients use their prescribed medication correctly, with incorrect inhaler use being a common issue due to lack of knowledge or difficulty in using devices.
3. Instruments assessing inhaler technique errors can help health professionals create targeted educational programs to improve treatment adherence.
4. The study aimed to validate two scores for assessing metered dose inhaler (MDI) and dry powder inhaler (DPI) techniques, identify common errors, and identify patients needing educational programs.
5. The study was conducted in three phases: validation of reliability, assessment of content validity, and assessment of criterion and discriminant validity.
6. The study found that the most common difficulty in using both MDI and DPI was maintaining the breath-hold after inhalation, with a high error rate in MDI use.
7. The study established cut-off scores to classify patients as able or unable to use inhalers, with those below the cut-off enrolled in educational programs.
8. The study's findings are clinically relevant as they provide validated scores to assess inhaler technique, identify common errors, and guide patient education, ultimately improving inhaler use and asthma management.

1. Bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, are of interest for their potential use in food preservation, human and veterinary applications, and animal production due to their natural and nontoxic properties.
2. The classification of bacteriocins is complex due to their heterogeneity, but they are generally categorized into four classes based on their structure and mode of action.
3. Enterocin s37, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis s37, was isolated from poultry feces and showed antagonism against Listeria and Campylobacter species, as well as enterococcal strains.
4. The antibacterial activity of enterocin s37 was assessed against various bacteria, with notable activity against Listeria and Campylobacter, but not against other strains like Staphylococcus and Salmonella.
5. Enterocin s37's activity was not affected by treatments with lipase and lysozyme, but was lost upon treatment with proteolytic enzymes such as -chymotrypsin, papain, and proteinase k.
6. The purification of enterocin s37 involved ammonium sulfate precipitation and two rp-hplc steps, resulting in a molecular weight between 4 and 6 kDa.
7. The study revealed that enterocin s37's activity could be influenced by k channel modulators, suggesting a potential mechanism involving the depletion of intracellular potassium levels through interaction with KATP channels.

1. In a phase 1 study and its extension, 73 lumbar punctures were performed in children with spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) to collect cerebrospinal fluid and administer nusinersen intrathecally, with approximately one-third associated with adverse events, mainly headache, back pain, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome.
2. A subgroup analysis revealed that older children ( 8-14 years), children with SMA type 3, and those with larger ( 21- or 22-gauge) needles experienced higher incidences of adverse events.
3. Using a 24-gauge or smaller needle reduced complications, and conservative treatment resolved post-lumbar puncture headaches without the need for a therapeutic blood patch. Ultrasound guidance may be beneficial in future studies to minimize radiation exposure.

1. The study aimed to explore senior managers' viewpoints on facilitators and barriers in clinical governance (cg) implementation within Iranian medical universities.
2. A qualitative research approach was used, involving face-to-face interviews and document reviews with forty-three deputies for curative affairs from various medical universities.
3. The study identified five main themes: knowledge and attitude, culture, organizational factors, managerial factors, and barriers.
4. Senior managers recognized that sufficient knowledge and a positive attitude towards cg are crucial for successful implementation, with continuous training being beneficial.
5. A supportive culture, appropriate organizational structure, and managerial commitment were highlighted as facilitators for cg implementation.
6. Barriers included lack of adequate managerial support, resource constraints, resistance from staff, and organizational challenges such as workload and staffing issues.
7. The study concluded that addressing these barriers through education, fostering a supportive culture, and ensuring managerial commitment are essential for effective cg implementation, ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare professionals.

1. The study aimed to develop, characterize, and optimize an orally dissolving strip (ODS) of clobazam, a drug used for epilepsy, using two polymers: peg-400 (pva) and sodium starch glycolate (ssg). A 3 factorial design was employed to evaluate the influence of pva and ssg on the film's mechanical properties, disintegration time, and dissolution rate.
2. The optimized formulation (f6) showed a high dissolution rate, suitable in vitro disintegration time, and satisfactory tensile strength. In vivo studies indicated no significant difference between the ODS and a marketed tablet formulation in terms of drug plasma level-time profiles, demonstrating comparable efficacy and patient compliance. The ODS was also stable for at least 6 months under accelerated stability conditions.
3. The ODS formulation f6, containing 100 mg of pva and 6% of ssg, is a promising alternative to fast dissolving tablets for the treatment of epilepsy, offering improved patient compliance and convenience without compromising drug efficacy.

1. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the methodological quality and psychometric properties of outcome measures used in stroke self-management interventions ( SMIs), according to the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measures (COSMIN) checklist.
2. Out of 43 different outcome measures used in the reviewed studies, only 21 demonstrated some properties in stroke populations, with none scoring in every category of COSMIN.
3. The majority of measures focused on health outcomes like physical functioning, mood, and quality of life, potentially reflecting an assumption that effective self-management results in improved physical functioning or that it is a desired outcome.
4. The review highlights the need for further conceptualization of stroke self-management, development of appropriate outcome measures, and clarification of the theoretical premises supporting SMIs in stroke to enable proper evaluation and development of interventions.

2. Estrogen has anti-inflammatory properties, but its role in inflammation post-menopause is debated, with some studies suggesting it prevents vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.
3. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of a high-fat diet and ovariectomy on inflammatory processes in rats by measuring pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and their receptors, as well as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) protein content.
4. Results showed that a high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy led to increased body weight gain, hyperleptinemia, and higher carcass lipid content, while also decreasing proinflammatory cytokines in mesenteric adipose tissues.

1. Hemoptysis is a significant symptom in respiratory diseases, with massive cases having a high mortality rate, necessitating quick treatment.
2. Traditional management included surgery, but it carried high morbidity and mortality, prompting the need for less invasive methods.
3. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) emerged as a safe and effective alternative for massive or recurrent hemoptysis, improving patient quality of life.
4. A retrospective study at Tianjin Hospital analyzed 344 patients who underwent BAE between 2006 and 2013, with hemoptysis volumes ranging from 502000 ml/24 h.
5. The study found that 92.2% of patients had identifiable causes for hemoptysis, with 7.8% showing focal hemorrhage, and 36.2% had bleeding localized to one lung, but not in an exact lobe.
6. Angiography revealed that the main responsible arteries were right bronchial arteries, left bronchial arteries, and combined right and left bronchial trunks, with more right intercostal arteries involved than left.
7. BAE was performed in 97.7% of patients, with a total of 920 arteries embolized, and was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 96% of cases.
8. Recurrent hemoptysis occurred in 17.7% of patients within 1 month, with three patients requiring a second BAE, and one patient developing new bleeding sites.
9. Complications included fever in 31.1%, chest pain in 18.9%, shoulder pain in 8.4%, and transient dysphagia or lower limb numbness in 0.9% of patients, all resolving within 48 hours.
10. Long-term outcomes showed that 28 patients died, six from massive hemorrhage, and twenty-one had recurrent hemoptysis with manageable bleeding volumes, highlighting BAE's effectiveness and safety as a treatment option.

1. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) are two prevalent etiologies of lymphocytic gastritis (LG) in children, with conflicting results on their relationship and contribution to LG.
2. The study aimed to explore the contribution of CD and HP infection to LG and to characterize the different immunoprofiles of the gastric inflammatory cells involved in these diseases.
3. Forty pediatric patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms were divided into four groups: normal controls, CD without HP, CD with HP, and HP without CD.
4. The diagnosis of LG was based on the presence of >25 intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) per 100 gastric epithelial cells, without considering mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration of the lamina propria (LP).
5. The study found a higher prevalence of LG in CD patients without HP infection (50%) compared to HP-infected patients without CD (8%), and a lower prevalence in HP-infected patients with CD (20%).
6. The study also found a significant increase in the number of CD3+ IELs in CD patients with or without HP infection compared to controls, and a significant increase in CD8+ IELs in CD patients compared to controls and HP-infected patients without CD.
7. The study suggested that the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum might hint toward a diagnosis of CD rather than HP infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles might direct toward a diagnosis of HP infection.

1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy ( VVA) is a common condition in postmenopausal women, affecting an estimated 32 million in the United States, with symptoms including dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and irritation.
2. VVA is chronic, progressive, and unlike vasomotor symptoms, does not resolve without treatment, potentially impacting women's quality of life and sexual relationships.
3. The ""revive"" survey, the largest study cohort of postmenopausal women in recent years, found that many women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its symptoms.
4. Only about a quarter of women with VVA symptoms identified menopause as the cause, and almost half had never discussed their symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP).
5. Women often wait until scheduled physical examinations or more than 7 months to discuss VVA symptoms with an HCP, and 73% of those who did felt neutral or negative about the information and treatment options provided.
6. Despite the prevalence of VVA symptoms, only 35% of women on any treatment for VVA were satisfied with their current treatment, with vaginal estrogen therapies generally more satisfying than over-the-counter (OTC) options.
7. Concerns about long-term safety, messiness, and treatment efficacy were common among users of OTC products and prescription therapies, leading to dissatisfaction and discontinuation of treatment.
8. Many women who had not been diagnosed with VVA or were not using treatment did so because they believed their symptoms were not bothersome enough or had safety concerns about hormone exposure.

3. The study found that maternal age, education, income, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity were associated with FA supplement use.
4. Women with a previous spontaneous abortion were more likely to use FA supplements, suggesting a link between a high desire to conceive and increased knowledge about preconceptional FA guidelines.
5. The study also found that women with unplanned pregnancies were less likely to use FA supplements before pregnancy.
6. The study found little association between parity and FA use, contrary to previous studies.
7. The study found that women with other risky behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity, were less likely to comply with the FA recommendation or use MVs.

2. Statins, known for their lipid-lowering effects, also have pleiotropic effects, including improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress. They are used for PAD prevention, treatment, and perioperative management.
3. The study evaluated lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity in PAD patients before and after surgery, and compared these parameters with those in patients receiving simvastatin therapy.
4. Results showed that PAD patients had higher oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity before surgery. After surgery, there was a decrease in antioxidant capacity and thiol groups, with no significant change in lipid peroxidation. Simvastatin therapy did not significantly affect total antioxidant potential but increased ceruloplasmin activity, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of simvastatin on plasma antioxidant status.

1. The study aimed to investigate the effects of -aminoadipic acid ( aaa ) on retinal damage and neurodegeneration in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension ( aoh ) that mimics glaucoma.
2. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to acute iop elevation, and their retinas were examined at various time points post-iop elevation.
3. The rats were divided into control, aoh, aoh + phosphate-buffered saline ( pbs), and aoh + aaa groups, with aaa administered intravitreally after iop elevation.
4. The study found that aoh led to retinal damage, including reduced retinal thickness and increased apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells ( rgcs).
5. Aaa treatment significantly reduced retinal damage and apoptosis of rgcs compared to the aoh + pbs group, suggesting a protective effect of aaa on the retina.
6. Immunohistochemistry revealed that aaa treatment attenuated gliosis in mller cells, as indicated by reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) immunoreactivity.
7. Western blot analysis showed that aaa treatment significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( tnf-), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in the retinas of the aoh model.
8. The study concluded that aaa protects against aoh-induced retinal damage and neurodegeneration by inhibiting mller cell gliosis and downregulating tnf- production.
9. These findings suggest that aaa could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive conditions caused by defects in enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). Patients with 21-OHD may present with signs of androgen excess or salt - losing forms, managed with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy. Recent reports indicate a high prevalence of adrenal masses in untreated CAH patients, with most being benign. Two cases in this report underwent adrenalectomy due to increasing mass size and virilization. Patients with CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid adrenal tumor development and to manage symptoms effectively.
2. CAH is a continuum of disorders affecting patients throughout their lives, requiring multidisciplinary care. The pathogenesis of adrenal tumors in CAH patients is not clear, but may be related to acth hypersecretion due to lack of glucocorticoid synthesis. Avoiding high steroid doses and ensuring compliance to therapy are crucial to prevent tumor development.

1. Self-rated health (SRH) has been validated as a predictor of mortality and functional ability, and is commonly used to assess health status in various populations.
2. Noncommunicable diseases, largely attributed to behavioral factors like tobacco use, unhealthy diet, and insufficient physical activity, are prevalent worldwide, with poor health management contributing to chronic disease burden.
3. A study examining the relationship between dietary and physical activity behaviors and SRH found that lower fruit and vegetable intake and higher fatty food intake were associated with poorer SRH, adjusting for confounders such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, ethnicity, health insurance, and comorbidities.
4. The study also found that females were more likely to report poor or fair SRH, be obese, and engage in less physical activity compared to males, with physical activity being significantly associated with SRH in females.
5. The findings suggest that modifiable lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, are associated with SRH, and gender differences may influence the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention.

1. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in the prenatal diagnosis of central nervous system pathology, particularly in cases of cerebral ventriculomegaly, due to advances in MRI technology and a better understanding of fetal pathology.
2. MRI offers excellent contrast resolution, allowing for the differentiation of gray and white matter, and the visualization of the cortical region and fossa posterior without the limitations of ultrasound, such as maternal obesity or fetal position.
3. MRI is particularly useful for detecting small deposits of intraventricular blood, suggesting intraventricular hemorrhage as a cause of hydrocephaly, and for identifying corpus callosum dysgenesis and additional malformations like cortical anomalies and white matter pathology.
4. The added value of MRI in prenatal diagnosis is debated, with some studies advocating its use in moderate to severe cases of ventriculomegaly to detect and characterize additional anomalies, while others question its diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.
5. MRI can provide detailed information about normal and pathological cortical development and maturation, and is more sensitive in detecting white matter pathology, especially in later pregnancy stages.
6. Despite its limitations, such as the impact of fetal motion and the need for expert interpretation, MRI is a valuable tool in the prenatal diagnostic work-up of ventriculomegaly, especially when ultrasound findings are inconclusive or when additional anomalies are suspected.

1. The study analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and Medicare claims to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and skeletal-related events (SREs) on mortality among elderly patients with lung cancer, finding that bone metastasis was associated with increased mortality regardless of the presence of SREs.
2. Approximately 19.8% of patients aged 65 or older with newly diagnosed lung cancer had evidence of bone metastasis within a year of diagnosis, with 51% of these patients also having SREs.
3. The study concluded that bone metastasis was associated with mortality among lung cancer patients, with no additional effect of SREs on mortality observed.

1. Recent advances in metagenomics have led to the identification of the human gut microbiome and its potential role in health and disease, revealing a complex interplay between host genetics, diet, and microbial communities.
2. The gut microbiome is predominantly composed of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and the discovery of archaea, particularly Methanobrevibacter smithii, highlights the diversity of the gut ecosystem.
3. Studies have shown that the gut microbiome is influenced by environmental factors, maternal input, and diet, with significant interindividual variability, suggesting that the environment and maternal flora play a greater role than genetics in establishing bacterial communities.
4. The concept of ""enterotypes"" has emerged, classifying individuals into clusters based on bacterial species composition, with each enterotype having unique properties and potential health implications.
5. The gut microbiota has been linked to various physiological properties, including energy balance and metabolism, with studies in germ-free mice and monocolonization experiments suggesting that the microbiota can influence host adiposity and metabolic health.
6. The gut microbiota is also implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD), with altered microbial composition and diversity associated with the disease, and the microbiota may interact with the host through immune recognition molecules, influencing disease susceptibility and progression.

1. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has become a key treatment for heart failure patients with left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, but a subset of patients do not respond clinically to CRT. This study aimed to assess the acute haemodynamic response (AHR) to alternative LV pacing sites in patients who were clinical non-responders to CRT.
2. Twenty-four patients, with a mean age of 72.8 years and an average ejection fraction of 22.5%, underwent an acute haemodynamic study. The study involved optimizing the CRT system and pacing from various LV sites, including basal posterolateral, mid-posterolateral, apical, and septal locations, as well as an endocardial site opposite the coronary sinus lead. A rise in LV dp/dtmax of 15% from baseline was considered a positive AHR.
3. The study found that in patients with a positive AHR from the coronary sinus lead, endocardial pacing did not significantly increase LV dp/dtmax. However, in patients with a negative AHR from the coronary sinus lead, endocardial pacing at the optimal site (longest q-lv interval) led to a significant increase in LV dp/dtmax and clinical improvement in 5 out of 9 patients.
4. The study concluded that endocardial LV pacing, guided by acute haemodynamic studies, could improve clinical outcomes in non-responders to CRT. The optimal lead position was identified by the longest q-lv interval, and the AHR of 15% was not a definitive predictor of clinical response. The study also suggested that epicardial pacing at the optimal site might be an alternative to endocardial LV lead placement.

1. The study investigated the effects of 3,7-dimethyl-1,14-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone (ndga) on lifespan, body weight, food consumption, and tumor development in mice and drosophila.
2. Male b6c3f1 mice were randomly assigned to control or ndga-supplemented diets at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.5 g/kg body weight/day.
3. The median lifespan of mice consuming 3.5 g/kg ndga (373 mg/kg bw/d) was extended by 12%, while higher and lower dosages were ineffective.
4. Mice treated with ndga showed a significant increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis, but no evidence of acute liver or kidney toxicity.
5. In drosophila, ndga increased median lifespan by approximately 23% without affecting food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity.
6. The study suggests that the effects of ndga on lifespan may be due to its inhibitory effects on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), but further research is needed to confirm this mechanism.
7. The study also suggests that ndga may not be a hormetic agent, as it produced molecular damage at its optimum dosage for increasing lifespan.
8. The study concludes that while ndga can extend lifespan, it also increases the incidence of tumors and other pathologies, raising concerns about its safety and efficacy for long-term use.

2. Personalized medicine extends beyond drug and dosage optimization, potentially influencing treatment decisions such as withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted therapies based on individual genetic profiles.
3. In prostate cancer, DNA biomarkers can guide decisions on whether to delay treatment, while in hereditary cancers, genetic testing may lead to preventive surgeries.
4. Biomarkers are defined as measurable substances or biological structures that can influence, explain, or predict disease incidence or outcomes, with a focus on their association with health-related outcomes.
5. Biomarkers are categorized into various types, including dna biomarkers, tumor dna biomarkers, and general biomarkers, each with distinct characteristics and applications in diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction.
6. Dna biomarkers are stable, reproducible, and suitable for both prospective and retrospective studies, but their durability is challenged by the rapid discovery of new biomarkers.
7. Validation of biomarkers involves a multi-phase approach, including discovery, assay development and validation, retrospective validation, prospective validation, and randomized controlled trials, with considerations for sample handling, storage, and analytical validity.

1. Myosin Va ( myova ) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton, with each dimerized molecule consisting of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
2. Myova's movement is achieved through conformational changes in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms, allowing the motor to take 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.
3. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of myova, but high calcium levels can reduce motor processivity by causing calmodulin dissociation from the lever arms, potentially reducing the efficiency of lever arm displacement and the strain-dependent gating between motor heads.
4. Myova must be flexible to maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles, with the critical domains for maneuverability possibly located within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction.
5. Tethered particle microscopy (tpm) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains, a method previously applied to double-stranded DNA and nanoparticles.
6. Myova constructs of different lengths were used to isolate the contributions of individual structural domains to overall flexibility and flexural stiffness, with the flexural stiffness of the myova - fl construct serving as a baseline for comparison.
7. The flexural stiffness of the myova - s1 construct decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium, indicating a significant reduction in lever arm flexural stiffness due to calmodulin dissociation.
8. The distal rod domain of myova, located between the lever arms and the globular tail domain, has a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, suggesting it may be composed of a long coiled-coil segment or a series of coiled-coil segments interspersed with compliant disordered segments.
9. The lever arm / rod junction must be highly compliant to allow myova to avoid intracellular obstacles and switch tracks",1

1. The study aimed to determine if functional polymorphisms in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes could predict clinical outcomes in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients post-surgical resection.
2. Genotyping for six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aurka, erbb2, mdm2, cdh1, cdkn2a, and tp73 genes was performed in 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgery with curative intent.
3. Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the SNPs and disease-free survival (DFS) in EAC or ESCC patients, but multivariate analysis revealed that EAC patients with the heterozygous mdm2 t/g genotype had a significantly improved DFS compared to wild-type, and those with the homozygous cdh1 ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival.
4. The mdm2 t/g genotype was associated with a twofold reduced risk of disease recurrence in EAC patients, while the cdh1 ga/ga genotype was associated with a fourfold increased risk of disease recurrence.
5. These findings suggest that genetic variations in germ-line DNA can impact DFS in EAC patients, potentially aiding in the identification of high-risk individuals and informing treatment strategies.

3. A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was conducted over a 2-year period, involving 50 consenting participants from the odontology unit of Saint-Antoine Hospital.
4. The majority of participants were male (90%), with a median age of 39 years, and a history of sexual contamination (76%).
5. Candida species was isolated from the oral cavity in 76% of the participants, with Candida albicans being the most common (92%).
6. Pseudomembranous candidiasis was the most common clinical presentation of opc (52.6%), followed by erythematous (13.15%), angular cheilitis (13.15%), and a combination of all three (10.52%).
7. The distribution of oral lesions showed that 62% occurred at CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm^3, 26% at CD4+ cell counts of 201-499 cells/mm^3, and 12% at CD4+ cell counts > 500 cells/mm^3.
8. The majority of patients with opc had CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm^3 (73%).

2. A magnetic tracer technique using a handheld magnetometer has been evaluated as a radiation-free alternative, showing noninferiority to the combined technique with high identification rates.
3. The study aimed to optimize the clinical application of the magnetic technique for SLNB by evaluating three different - sized superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) formulations in an in vivo porcine model.
4. The 32 nm SPIO tracer showed rapid transcutaneous hotspot identification, while the 111 nm tracer required up to 240 minutes. The 59 nm tracer demonstrated the best performance, with a statistically significant higher magnetometer count and iron content, facilitating hotspot detection and intraoperative localization.
5. The study concluded that the 59 nm SPIO tracer is the most suitable for SLNB with a handheld magnetometer, with rapid distribution, retention in the first nodes, and high concentration accumulation, while the 32 nm tracer may result in excessive excision of normal nodes.

2. Plasma adiponectin levels are highly heritable and inversely associated with T2DM and other metabolic traits, with higher levels observed in men with metabolic syndrome.
3. A study measured serum vaspin and adiponectin levels in subjects with normal renal function and renal insufficiency, with or without T2DM, and compared various clinical parameters.
4. Subjects were divided into four groups: non-T2DM with renal insufficiency (n=27), non-T2DM without renal insufficiency (n=220), T2DM with renal insufficiency (n=23), and T2DM without renal insufficiency (n=146).
5. The serum vaspin levels were not significantly different between non-T2DM patients with renal insufficiency and those without, or between T2DM patients with and without renal insufficiency.
6. Serum adiponectin levels were higher in non-T2DM patients with renal insufficiency compared to those without, but did not differ between T2DM patients with and without renal insufficiency.
7. Serum vaspin levels were related to creatinine in patients without T2DM, but not in those with T2DM.
8. Serum adiponectin levels were related to creatinine clearance, total cholesterol, and other parameters in all subjects, but not significantly correlated with any parameter in T2DM patients.

1. The study aimed to identify surrogate markers for complete healing in advanced diabetic foot ulcers (dfus) and assess their predictive capacity and contribution to the final outcome.
2. Two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials were analyzed, involving 190 patients with neuropathic dfus, and an active postmarketing surveillance of rhegf treatment in 1,440 dfus in 60 healthcare units.
3. Surrogate markers included percent change in area, log healing rate, ratio of log areas at 2nd week and end of treatment (eot), and additional variables.
4. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each surrogate variable, and cutoff points were generated to maximize sensitivity and specificity.
5. The best surrogates were granulation tissue covering > 75% of the ulcer area at eot and > 50% at 2nd week, with high sensitivity and specificity for predicting complete healing.
6. The proportion mediated by granulation tissue was very high, suggesting that almost 100% of the effect of treatment on complete healing was mediated by granulation tissue formation.
7. The effect of treatment on healing was lost when either 2 weeks > 50% granulation or eot > 75% granulation was incorporated in the model, indicating that granulation tissue is essential for healing.
8. The association between covariates (initial area and etiology) and outcomes (granulation and healing) was similar for all models.
9. The results of the postmarketing series confirmed that granulation tissue development at eot was an early predictor of final healing, with a 72.9% certainty.
10. The study provides evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced dfus, which can be useful for clinical trial design and patient management.

2. The ntapp procedure used an 8-mm umbilical trocar and required significantly less operating time (54.8 minutes) compared to the stapp procedure (85.9 minutes), with a mean umbilical skin incision length of 13.4 mm versus 27.3 mm in the stapp group.
3. Immediate postoperative pain duration was longer in the stapp group (9.8 days) compared to the ntapp group (5.6 days), and stapp patients experienced greater wound pain intensity when resuming daily activities.
4. Despite similar long-term results in hernia recurrence, abdominal wall mobility, and cosmetic satisfaction, the ntapp group had a significantly shorter mean period of sick leave (11.2 days) compared to the stapp group (24.1 days), even with some patients remaining on sick leave due to chronic discomfort or postherniorrhaphy pain syndrome.

1. The study aimed to verify the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils in children with mouth breathing symptoms.
2. A significant regular and positive correlation (r = 0.52) was found between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry, indicating that both exams are associated in diagnosing the condition.
3. Cephalometry showed a tendency to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsil compared to nasopharyngoscopy, with a sensitivity of 35% for detecting hyperplasia.
4. The study suggests that nasopharyngoscopy should be used when cephalometry results are negative in patients with mouth breathing symptoms, as it provides a more accurate assessment of the nasopharynx.

1. Inflammatory breast carcinoma ( IBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that can present as a local recurrence ( ibtr) or a new primary tumor ( npt) in the same breast after initial treatment. Differentiating between these two is crucial for prognosis and management, with IBC being more common in younger women and those with a family history of breast cancer.
2. The incidence of ibtr is low, but it is important to distinguish between true local recurrence ( tr) and a new primary tumor ( npt) due to their different natural histories and prognoses. Treatment options vary, with salvage mastectomy being the standard for ibtr, though the optimal systemic therapy post-surgery remains unclear.
3. Breast cancer survivors require careful follow-up, with IBC survivors needing to be monitored for a longer period due to the risk of contralateral breast cancer. The care of breast cancer survivors is an important issue that requires an understanding of relapse patterns, establishing appropriate follow-up visits and screening tests.

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in older adults, with the neovascular form involving choroidal neovascularization (CNV) being the primary cause of severe central vision loss. Anti-VEGF treatments have significantly improved management of neovascular AMD, with ranibizumab and aflibercept being approved options.
2. This study aimed to evaluate the change in pelli 
 robson contrast sensitivity (CS) as the primary clinical end point in patients with treatment-resistant neovascular AMD who were switched from ranibizumab to aflibercept therapy.
3. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in CS from baseline to week 12 after the switch, with no significant change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) or central retinal thickness (CRT). Additionally, 65% of patients experienced an overall improvement in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) composite score.
4. The study suggests that CS measurement, alongside BCVA, can provide a more complete understanding of visual performance and treatment benefits in patients with neovascular AMD, supporting the consideration of CS as a valuable additional outcome endpoint in future clinical studies of AMD and other retinal diseases.

1. The study aimed to use non-contrast CT to explore the prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysm ( taa) and abdominal aortic aneurysm ( aaa) in a Korean population with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease ( chd) and aortic aneurysm ( aa).
2. A total of 542 consecutive Korean male hypertensive patients without a history of aa were prospectively enrolled, and after exclusions, 496 patients remained for analysis.
3. The prevalence of taa and aaa was 36.5% and 6.0%, respectively, with 16 patients having both conditions.
4. Taa was more prevalent in patients with aaa (p=0.010), and was associated with older age, larger body surface area, higher diastolic blood pressure, and absence of dyslipidemia.
5. Aaa was significantly associated with dyslipidemia, current/past smoking, and presence of taa.
6. The study concluded that taa was more prevalent than aaa in high-risk Korean males with hypertension, and that the clinical implications of the high prevalence of taa need further evaluation.

1. Endometrial cancer has become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries, prompting the need for effective screening methods.
2. Traditional endometrial sampling methods, such as dilation and curettage (d & c) and hysteroscopic biopsy, are reliable but invasive and uncomfortable for patients.
3. The study aimed to investigate the adequacy of specimens obtained using the sap-1 device compared to those obtained by d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy, with a focus on maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the endometrium.
4. The study involved 1514 patients with risk factors for endometrial cancer, with 375 undergoing d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy in addition to the sap-1 sampling.
5. The sap-1 device provided more sufficient materials for cytology than d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy, with 96.3% adequate specimens for cytology compared to 76% for d & c and hysteroscopic biopsy.
6. The overall accuracy for detecting endometrial cancer, complex hyperplasia with atypia, and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia using the sap-1 sampler and liquid-based surepath preparation was 92.4%, with a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 95.8%, positive predictive value of 75%, and negative predictive value of 95.3%.
7. The sap-1 sampler combined with the liquid-based surepath preparation method may become a reliable method for screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursors, especially in postmenopausal and asymptomatic women.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with high incidence rates in Europe and North America. Despite the efficacy of mammography, challenges such as overlapping tissue obscuring tumors and high false-positive recall rates persist. Digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) are advancements that offer improved sensitivity and reduced false positives, with DBT providing a quasi-3D view of breast tissue to better differentiate abnormalities.
2. Population-based trials have shown that integrating DM with DBT increases invasive cancer detection rates and decreases false-positive recalls without missing cancers. DBT also allows for less breast compression, potentially improving patient comfort. Efforts to reduce radiation exposure include synthesizing DBT images to eliminate the need for additional DM exposures, thus lowering the overall radiation dose.
3. The use of intravenous contrast with DBT and digital mammography (DM) is being explored to further enhance tumor detection by taking advantage of malignant neovascularity. These developments in mammographic imaging technologies aim to improve cancer detection, reduce false positives, and minimize patient discomfort, with ongoing research and larger population studies to determine their true performance and impact.

2. Diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is classified as an antitussive in the United States FDA's OTC monograph.
3. Cough is a common complaint leading to medical attention, with billions spent annually on OTC cough preparations.
4. Three non-narcotic oral agents are listed as antitussives in the FDA's final monograph: chlophedianol, dextromethorphan, and diphenhydramine.
5. Diphenhydramine has been shown to inhibit citric acid-induced cough and pathological chronic cough relative to placebo.
6. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of a diphenhydramine-containing syrup, compared with a dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo, on cough reflex sensitivity in healthy adults with acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI).

1. Aging is associated with a decline in endothelial function, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. This decline is characterized by reduced production of nitric oxide (NO), increased oxidative stress, and inflammation.
2. Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defense, leads to the reduction of NO bioavailability, contributing to endothelial dysfunction.
3. Inflammation, characterized by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is a critical component of the aging process and contributes to endothelial dysfunction.
4. Exercise training has been shown to prevent and restore age-related impairment of endothelial function, possibly by restoring NO availability and alleviating inflammatory processes.
5. Exercise-induced oxidative stress triggers adaptive responses, including upregulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms and increased NO production, which counteract the negative effects of oxidative stress.
6. Regular exercise also induces anti-inflammatory effects, reducing proinflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory substances, thereby contributing to the maintenance of endothelial function and cardiovascular health in the elderly.

1. The number of metastatic lymph nodes ( MNL ) and the ratio of MNL to the number of removed lymph nodes ( lnr ) are more prognostically significant than the traditional axillary lymph node status in breast carcinoma.
2. Studies have shown that the number of MNL increases with the number of removed lymph nodes, and lnr provides a more reliable prognostic information than the traditional nodal disease classification.
3. The prognostic significance of lnr varies in different studies, and the threshold value for clinically significant lnr differs based on sampling size and tumor stage.
4. Our study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the number of removed and MNL and lnr in breast carcinoma patients with 13 MNL.
5. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 924 patients who underwent surgery for breast carcinoma and were followed up for at least five years.
6. The most significant lnr threshold value separating patients in low- and high-risk groups for disease-free survival ( dfs ) was 0.20, for locoregional recurrence-free survival ( lrfs ) was 0.30, and for distant metastasis-free survival ( dmfs ) was 0.15.

1. The study demonstrates the use of acid phosphatases as efficient catalysts for the enantioselective phosphorylation of primary and secondary alcohols using inorganic polyphosphates (PPi and PPPi) as phosphate donors, achieving absolute chemoselectivity for hydroxyl groups over amines and nitriles, and high regioselectivity for primary over secondary hydroxyl groups. The phosphorylation reactions proceed under mild conditions with inorganic monophosphate and unreacted phosphate donor as byproducts, and the thermodynamically favored hydrolysis of phosphate esters can be minimized by controlling reaction parameters. Scaleup was demonstrated by the synthesis of 4-hydroxybutyl phosphate using an immobilized enzyme in flow mode.
2. The study also explores the enantioselectivity of phosphatases, showing that while phonsf and piacp exhibit nonenantioselective phosphorylation, phonse shows a marginal enantiopreference for (R)-2butanol. The study further investigates the effect of reaction parameters such as pH and phosphate donor type on the phosphorylation process, and evaluates various polymeric beads for the immobilization of phosphatases, with relizyme ha403/m showing the highest specific activity for both enzymes.

1. Biological invasions have been a significant environmental issue for centuries, with notable examples like the phylloxera and chestnut blight, but it wasn't until Charles Elton's 1950s work that the phenomenon gained widespread attention.
2. Despite Elton's book, a major research surge in invasion biology didn't occur until the 1980s, spurred by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, which led to a deeper understanding of the ecological and evolutionary impacts of invasions.
3. Research has shown that invasions can affect ecosystem processes, nutrient cycles, and physical structures, often in subtle and long-term ways.
4. Molecular genetic research has revealed extensive hybridization and introgression between native and introduced species, leading to novel genetic combinations and sometimes the emergence of new invasive species.
5. Critics of invasion biology argue that the impacts are overstated, that some introduced species can increase biodiversity, and that efforts to manage invasions are either xenophobic or futile.
6. However, the scientific consensus is that invasions cause significant ecological and economic harm, and that while eradication is challenging, it is not impossible. Restoration ecology aims to re-establish historical ecosystem trajectories, not to create novel ecosystems, and prevention and management of invasions are crucial.

1. Schwannomas are rare tumors of the nerve sheath that arise from the primary glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, typically benign and slow growing, but can cause significant morbidity due to direct nerve involvement or local mass effect.
2. Approximately 25 to 45% of all schwannomas are found in the head and neck, with the most common being vestibular schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve.
3. Schwannomas in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, particularly vidian canal schwannomas, are much rarer.
4. The vidian canal extends from the pterygopalatine fossa to the foramen lacerum and contains the vidian nerve, which is composed of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve and postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the carotid sympathetic plexus.
5. Vidian schwannomas can present with a variety of clinical symptoms, including decreased lacrimation, nasal dryness, and facial pain or paresthesias, due to compression of surrounding structures or nerve involvement.
6. To date, only four documented cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas have appeared in the literature, with symptoms ranging from headaches and facial palsy to oculomotor palsy and cerebrospinal fluid leak.
7. Traditional management of peripheral nerve tumors is surgical, but radiation therapy is an alternative option, especially for patients with underlying conditions that may confer additional sensitivity to radiation or when surgical risks are disproportionate.

The electrodeposition of copper(i) stannate (cuscn) in the presence of rhodamine b (rb) as a structure-directing agent (sda) has been optimized to create highly porous and crystalline cuscn thin films, with the porosity and crystallographic orientation controlled by the bath composition. The rb can be nearly completely removed by soaking the films in dimethylacetamide (dma), resulting in a highly porous structure with a large surface area suitable for dye-sensitized photocathodes.
2. The porous cuscn films, sensitized with rb, exhibit strong photocathodic properties, showing a significant increase in photocurrent upon illumination. However, challenges such as the lack of a stable dye-electrolyte combination and a suitable hole-injecting dye remain for further efficiency improvement of the photocathode.

2. Tornwaldt's cyst develops if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, while crusts adhering without obstruction form the crust type.
3. The crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis, indicated by Eagle in 1939, is characterized by non-obstructed bursal orifice despite crust formation, leading to offensive smell and unpleasant taste.
4. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal bursitis can include space-occupying lesions, rhinitis, and headache, with the crust type often presenting with retching, expectoration of crusts, and occasional occipital pain.
5. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, with no gender predilection, and can appear at any age.
6. An audit at a rhinology practice over two years identified six patients with nasopharyngeal bursitis, with an equal incidence of cystic and crust types.
7. The cystic type presented with postnasal discharge, throat irritation, and cough, while the fibrosed type was discovered incidentally in a patient with snoring.
8. Surgical disruption of the bursa with electrocauterization was performed on patients with either cystic or crust types, resulting in complete recovery without recurrence at more than one year postoperatively.

3. Automated analysis of dermoscopic images has been proposed to assist in melanoma diagnosis, but challenges remain in terms of reproducibility and observer variability.
4. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been developed to improve diagnostic performance, but they often fail to achieve high concordance rates.
5. A comprehensive review of automatic diagnostic models for skin lesions is needed, focusing on lesion segmentation, feature extraction, classification techniques, and performance measures.
6. Preprocessing of dermoscopic images is essential for accurate analysis, involving color space transformation, color quantization, contrast enhancement, and artifact removal.
7. Segmentation algorithms are varied, with no consensus on the best approach, and feature extraction methods include statistical and model-based techniques, with the abcd-e rule being commonly used.
8. Feature selection is critical for reducing data redundancy and improving classification performance, with methods like PCA, WPT, and GLCM being popular.
9. Classification algorithms for dermoscopic images include k-NN, decision trees, logistic regression, ANN, SVM, and ELM, with SVM and ELM often outperforming others.

2. Subjects with established coronary disease on dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin were included, with exclusion criteria for various health conditions and contraindications.
3. Platelet aggregation was measured using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and verifynow (VN) p2y12 assay before and after clopidogrel therapy, and genotyping was performed for cyp2c19 *2 and pon1 (q192r) polymorphisms.
4. The study found no significant association between pon1 (q192r) genotype and platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, as measured by LTA and VN assays.
5. However, cyp2c19 *2 carrier status was associated with reduced platelet inhibition and increased on-treatment platelet reactivity, as measured by LTA and VN assays.
6. The study confirmed the previously reported impact of reduced-function cyp2c19 *2 polymorphism on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, supporting the clinical importance of this polymorphism.
7. The study's findings suggest that pon1 (q192r) polymorphisms may not be predictive of clopidogrel response when measured by LTA and VN assays in patients with coronary artery disease.

2. In a retrospective analysis of 242 children with type 1 diabetes, PR occurred in 56.2% of patients, with no complete remission observed.
3. PR was associated with lower dkA at diagnosis, particularly in boys, and with higher initial c-peptide levels, especially in older children.
4. Patients with PR had lower baseline HbA1c at diagnosis and lower HbA1c levels at 2 years after diagnosis, suggesting a short-term effect of PR on metabolic control.
5. No differences in PR duration or occurrence of severe hypoglycemia were observed between patients with and without PR, indicating that PR may not have long-term benefits in terms of complications or hypoglycemia risk.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between objectively quantified sedentary behavior, habitual physical activity, and levels of visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) and intrahepatic lipid ( IHL) in adults with overweight or obesity. The study found no significant associations between objectively measured sedentary behavior, moderate physical activity, and levels of VAT or IHL. Traditional risk factors such as waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin were more predictive of VAT and IHL levels than objectively measured physical activity levels and sedentary behavior.
2. The findings suggest that while traditional risk factors may predict the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) or high levels of VAT, objectively quantified physical activity levels and sedentary behavior do not significantly predict individuals at risk for these conditions. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the complex relationship between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and metabolically detrimental fat depots.

1. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (CDAD), with treatment often based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh) and toxins A and B (CD toxins) detection.
2. EIA has lower sensitivity for CD toxins compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects toxin genes, leading to potential misdiagnosis in patients with negative stool but positive isolates.
3. The study aimed to compare clinical history and treatment needs among patients with Gdh-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens, toxin-negative but positive isolates, and dual-negative stool and isolates.
4. A retrospective study included patients aged 2 years with C. difficile growth on stool culture and Gdh-positive EIA stool specimens between March 2013 and June 2014, divided into three groups based on EIA results.
5. The study found that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but positive isolates had milder symptoms and shorter diarrhea duration than those with toxin-positive stool specimens, despite receiving less treatment.
6. No significant differences in clinical inflammation markers were observed among the groups, suggesting no strong correlation between toxin detection and inflammation at symptom onset.
7. The study supports findings that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but positive isolates may have milder symptoms and shorter diarrhea duration, indicating a limited need for CDAD treatment in these cases.
8. The study highlights the importance of PCR testing for a definitive diagnosis of CDAD, as EIA may not accurately reflect the patient's disease status.
9. Further research is needed to investigate the genetic characteristics of C. difficile strains and their correlation with clinical outcomes.

1. The Dream Trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine if ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), metabolic states indicating high risk for diabetes.
2. A total of 5,269 participants were randomized to receive either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone, and they were followed for a median of 3 years.
3. The primary outcome variable was the change in insulin secretion, measured by the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration, with adjustments for insulin resistance and other covariates.
4. Participants receiving rosiglitazone showed a significant increase in IGI/HMA-IR and a significant decrease in PI/c-peptide ratio over the study period, while those on ramipril did not show significant changes in these measures.
5. The improvement in insulin secretion measures with rosiglitazone was consistent across glucose tolerance subgroups, although more modest in those with isolated IFG.
6. Rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes, even after adjusting for baseline insulin secretion measures, suggesting that its diabetes prevention effect is not solely mediated through improvements in insulin secretion.
7. In contrast, ramipril did not significantly affect insulin secretion measures and did not significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes, suggesting that its glucose-lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms.

1. Microbial communities exhibit complex metabolic interactions that differ from monocultures, including the degradation of various toxins, production of natural products, and growth in diverse environments.
2. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism requires examining both individual strains in pure culture and the combinatorial interactions within complex communities, which can involve naturally complementary metabolism or genetically engineered interactions.
3. Interacting microbial strains can share metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, and glucose, reflecting the genotypic diversity of the community.
4. A theoretical model was developed to predict the extent of complex metabolic interactions based on the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network, without detailed biochemical characterization of each strain.
5. The model was tested using 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli strains, which showed robust growth in rich medium but no growth in minimal medium when cultured in pairs.
6. The model revealed that certain pairs of auxotrophs exhibited metabolic synergy, referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (Smit), where one strain's growth complements the other's, reflecting the underlying metabolic network.
7. The model also identified biosynthetic modules and metabolic network stoichiometries that govern the emergent phenotype of Smit interactions, suggesting that complex phenotypes can emerge from simple reaction networks.
8. The model's predictions correlated with measured growth, and it was effective in reproducing the observation that mutants in shared pathways generally do not supplement each other's growth.

1. Phasix mesh and poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (p4hb) plug repairs demonstrated similar burst strength and relative stiffness at 6 , 12 , 26 , and 52 weeks with no significant differences detected between the two devices for either parameter throughout the study ( p > 0.05 in all cases ) . 
 Both repairs also exhibited significantly greater burst strength and relative stiffness compared to the native abdominal wall at all time points regardless of the device used to bridge the defect ( p < 0.05 in all cases ) . 
 These results indicate that the p4hb material is capable of augmenting the strength of the native porcine abdominal wall and that the configuration of the p4hb material does not significantly impact its resorption profile.
2. Gel permeation chromatography revealed that phasix mesh and p4hb plug possessed similar molecular weights at all time points with no significant differences detected between the two devices at any time ( p > 0.05 in all cases ) . 
 The molecular weight of both the phasix mesh and the p4hb plug decreased significantly over time with molecular weights of 240 , 510  2 , 018  da , 204 , 282  4 , 457  da , 118 , 884  2 , 821  da , and 44 , 434  879  da at 6 , 12 , 26 , and 52 weeks , respectively . 
 These results indicate that the p4hb material was significantly resorbed over time, but significant material resorption did not correspond with a significant drop in mechanical strength at the repair site for either the phasix mesh or the p4hb plug design.
3. Histological assessment revealed a comparable and mild inflammatory response and mild to moderate granulation tissue / vascularization associated with the p4hb material regardless of its configuration as a mesh or a plug .

1. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( VRE) have become significant nosocomial pathogens, and rapid detection is crucial for infection control.
2. The xpert vana/vanb assay, a fully automated system, was implemented in a Danish hospital setting to rapidly detect VRE directly from rectal swabs using real-time PCR.
3. The assay's diagnostic accuracy was evaluated, comparing its results with traditional culture methods.
4. The study included 1110 VRE screening samples from 804 patients, with a high concordance rate between PCR and culture results (96.1%).
5. The sensitivity of the vana PCR assay was 87.1%, with a specificity of 99.7%.
6. The xpert vana/vanb assay allowed for rapid implementation of infection control measures, saving 141 isolation days and 292 transmission risk days.
7. False-negative or false-positive PCR results led to additional transmission risk days and isolation days.
8. The majority of samples were from outbreaks, with some from roommate screening, readmission, or transfer from outbreak wards.
9. The study concluded that the xpert vana/vanb assay had high diagnostic accuracy and considerable impact on infection control decision-making, justifying its costs in the context of VRE outbreak management.

1. The study aimed to characterize and compare the effects of ru28318 (ru), captopril (capt), and losartan (los), alone or in double and triple therapy combinations, on ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction in isolated hearts from normal and diabetic rats.
2. Ru alone or in combination with captopril or losartan was generally more effective than either drug alone in improving cardiac function in both normal and diabetic hearts, with triple therapy (capt + los + ru) being the most effective strategy.
3. In diabetic hearts, captopril and losartan were more effective when administered after ischemia, while ru was only effective when given before ischemia, suggesting a differential role of aldosterone receptor signaling in diabetes.
4. The study suggests that mR antagonists, by acting through a non-ACE/angiotensin II/AT1 receptor pathway, may represent a novel class of RAAS inhibitors that could overcome the limitations observed with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and that optimal drug usage may require selection based on specific criteria including the pathological state and the desired rate of cardiac function recovery.

1. Modern nasal surgery aims to enhance both the cosmetic appearance and natural functions of the nose, with acoustic rhinometry (AR) being a common method for measuring nasal cavity geometry due to its ease of use and minimal subject cooperation.
2. The study evaluated changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers undergoing cosmetic rhinoplasty, comparing measurements taken before and after surgery, with and without decongestants.
3. The geometric values of nasal cavities were measured using AR, and the results were analyzed using paired t-tests to determine significant differences.
4. The study found that bilateral distance (d2) and minimal cross-sectional area (mca2) did not change significantly postoperatively, while the minimal cross-sectional area at the first local minimum point (mca1) increased significantly.
5. The study also compared the effects of septoplasty and osteotomy on nasal airway patency, revealing that septoplasty led to more significant increases in mca1 and less constriction in mca2.
6. Double osteotomy was associated with a greater increase in mca1 compared to single osteotomy, and placing a columellar strut was beneficial for patients in both rhinoplasty with and without septoplasty.
7. The study concluded that even mild septal deviations can benefit from septoplasty, and double osteotomy positively affects nasal function by increasing mca1.
8. The findings highlight the importance of careful intervention at the second constriction during surgery to preserve nasal patency, and suggest that placing a strut may be beneficial in most cases.

1. Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in developed nations, with ongoing research focusing on preventing early development of risk factors like atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have shown beneficial effects in observational and experimental studies, with their lipid-lowering action initially recognized and later associated with anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmic effects.
2. Low-grade chronic inflammation is now understood to be a key process in atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, with endothelial cells normally maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. However, in atherosclerosis, this balance is disrupted, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, which can be modulated by n-3 PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives.
3. N-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential fatty acids that the human body cannot synthesize, and their intake is primarily related to dietary sources, particularly fish. DHA is preferentially incorporated into the myocardial cell membrane, influencing the beta-adrenergic system and potentially contributing to its hypotensive and antiarrhythmic actions.
4. The cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs are multifaceted, involving lipid lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-arrhythmic, and anti-thrombotic properties. They also improve endothelial function and modulate inflammation through various mechanisms, including changes in eicosanoid metabolism and the resolution of inflammation. Dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs may lead to improvements in cardiovascular health parameters due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiarrhythmic actions.

1. The development of gastric cancer is understood to be a multistep process initiated by chronic inflammation, often due to Helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection, as outlined by the pioneering work of pathologists such as Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren.
2. Virchow's early observations suggested that cancer could arise from normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation, a concept that has been supported by numerous examples of inflammation-induced cancers.
3. Correa's model, developed in 1975, proposed a stepwise progression from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and eventually to gastric cancer, with the initial changes occurring in the first decade of life, coinciding with h. pylori colonization.
4. Initially, environmental factors like diet were thought to contribute to gastric cancer, but the discovery of h. pylori by Warren and Marshall shifted the focus towards bacterial infection as a primary cause.
5. Early studies in the 1980s and 1990s provided weak evidence for a link between h. pylori and gastric cancer, with inconsistent results across different populations and study designs.
6. Large cohort studies with nested case-controls provided strong evidence, showing a significantly higher prevalence of h. pylori infection in individuals who developed gastric cancer compared to those who did not, leading to the World Health Organization's classification of h. pylori as a definite carcinogen in 1994.
7. Subsequent research confirmed the role of h. pylori in gastric cancer, showing that eradication of the bacteria reduces the risk of developing gastric cancer by approximately 40% in primary prevention and 54% in tertiary prevention.
8. Despite the benefits of h. pylori eradication in high-risk regions, there is hesitation to adopt similar strategies in the developed world due to concerns about the potential protective effects of h. pylori against esophageal diseases, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma.",1

1. Preeclampsia (PE) is a significant cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, with proteinuria being a traditional marker for its diagnosis. However, recent studies suggest proteinuria may not be a significant predictor of adverse outcomes.
2. The incidence of PE has increased in China, prompting research into potential indicators of severe PE, such as hypoalbuminemia.
3. Hypoalbuminemia, often resulting from systemic small vessel spasm and increased secretion of angiotensin, can lead to intravascular dehydration and predispose to severe PE complications.
4. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with PE, comparing mild hypoproteinemia (HP) and severe hypoproteinemia (SPH).
5. The study included 299 women with singleton pregnancies, with SPH defined as an albumin value of less than 25 g/L. Outcomes included delivery mode, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, hypertension, liver and renal function, ascites, thrombocytopenia, and abruptio placenta.
6. Women with SPH were more likely to have cesarean sections, severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta. Their neonates were more likely to have fetal growth restriction, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm delivery.
7. The study concluded that SPH in PE is a significant risk factor for cesarean section, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes, suggesting the need for closer surveillance during pregnancy.

The past 20 years have seen significant advancements in targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) signaling pathway in cancer treatment, with the development of agents like the humanized monoclonal antibody Avastin (bevacizumab) targeting VEGF-A, and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) inhibitors targeting VEGF receptors.
2. Despite the success of Avastin in treating certain cancers, limitations such as resistance and refractoriness have emerged, highlighting the need for alternative targets within the vegf family, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which are implicated in tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
3. The vegf family includes multiple ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, PigF, and others) and receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3), each with distinct roles in cancer progression. Monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting these ligands and receptors are in development, with the potential to enhance anti-cancer therapies when combined with existing treatments like Avastin.
4. The complexity of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis signaling pathways necessitates a comprehensive approach, including genome-wide functional studies and the exploration of alternative molecular targets, to develop effective and less toxic treatments for cancer.

3. Immunological responses to target antigens have been used as biomarkers for antigen-specific vaccines, but less is known about biomarkers for agents targeting broader immune modulation.
4. A subset of prostate-associated antigens has been identified as potential biomarkers for distinguishing prostate cancer from other conditions.
5. The study aimed to evaluate immune responses to a panel of prostate-associated antigens as biomarkers for immune-active therapies.
6. Sera samples from patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy, a viral vaccine encoding PSA, and a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding PAP were analyzed for IgG responses to multiple antigens.
7. Androgen deprivation elicited IgG responses to multiple antigens, while vaccines induced responses to different antigens not commonly recognized by patients with prostate cancer.
8. IgG responses to individual antigens were highly specific for the treatment received, suggesting that antigen spread might be a mechanism of recognition.
9. Machine-learned Bayesian Belief Networks (ml-bbns) were used to identify biomarkers associated with PSA decline, revealing potential predictive biomarkers.
10. The study suggests that IgG responses to a panel of prostate-associated antigens could serve as biomarkers for immune responses to prostate-directed therapies, with larger studies needed to validate and refine these biomarkers.

4. A new approach involves the development of smart implants that integrate systems for bone mechanical stimulation using piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect.
5. The study explored the use of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as a substrate for mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts, with the aim of promoting bone growth at the implant interface.
6. The PVDF films were coated using a dip-coating process to improve cell adhesion and electrical insulation, and the coating procedure was validated for sterilization.
7. The study involved implanting actuator devices composed of PVDF and silver electrodes in the left hind limb of a 4-year-old merino ewe, with a control device implanted in the right hind limb.
8. The results showed a significant increase in total bone area and mineral apposition rate around the actuated devices compared to static controls, suggesting that piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect can effectively stimulate bone growth at the bone implant interface.

1. The study applied a critical theory perspective to examine nurses' involvement in national health policy processes in Kenya, revealing that hierarchies and gender-related issues within the health care system hinder nurses' participation in policy development.
2. To enhance nurses' participation in policy-making, it is suggested that legislation be enacted to allow nurses with leadership and policy competencies to hold senior positions, and that nursing education include policy and research courses to build competencies in policy formulation and advocacy.

1. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in infants and young children, presenting with non-specific systemic symptoms, necessitating a complete sepsis workup and a course of antibiotic therapy.
2. The study aimed to retrospectively review all UTI cases managed in the neonatal division of Bahrami Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran, over an eight-year period (June 2004 to June 2012).
3. The study included 73 cases, with a mean age of 14.14 days and a mean birth weight of 3055.85 grams, predominantly male (69.9%).
4. E. coli was the most prevalent organism causing UTI in neonates, found in 64.4% of cases, followed by Enterobacter with 19.2%.
5. E. coli showed significant resistance to ampicillin (93.6%), while Enterobacter was resistant to ampicillin (92.9%) and amikacin (100%).
6. Klebsiella and S. epidermidis were completely resistant to ampicillin, but sensitive to gentamicin.
7. The study suggests that third-generation cephalosporins plus an aminoglycoside may be a better choice for empirical therapy of neonatal UTI than ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside.
8. The study highlights the need for prospective studies on neonatal UTI in Iran and emphasizes the importance of understanding causative organisms' susceptibility patterns for effective empirical therapy.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion, with the most common variant being 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD).
2. CAH patients exhibit a chronic hyperandrogenic state due to diversion of precursors to androgens, resulting in various clinical forms, including salt-wasting (SW), simple virilizing (SV), and non-classical (NC) forms.
3. Treatment involves glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, but conventional glucocorticoid therapy cannot mimic natural cortisol rhythms, potentially causing over- or under-suppression and associated complications.
4. Previous studies have documented brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in CAH patients, but the relationship between these abnormalities and CAH phenotypes or treatment regimens remains unclear.
5. This study investigated MRI findings in 26 Tunisian CAH patients with 21-OHD, focusing on white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis.
6. MRI revealed white matter hyperintensities in seven patients (71.4%), with locations in periventricular regions or cerebellar white matter, and moderate right temporal lobe atrophy in one patient (3.8%).
7. The study suggests that brain MRI abnormalities in CAH patients could be due to hormonal imbalances during brain development and corticosteroid treatment, with implications for cognitive function and emotional processing.

1. The study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the in vivo debonding force of orthodontic brackets and compare it with in vitro tensile strength tests.
2. A modified plier with a strain gauge connected to the claw was created, and a software recorded the debonding force in kgf.
3. The prototype was tested in vivo by debonding brackets from enamel, and the results were compared to in vitro tensile strength tests using a universal testing machine.
4. The mean debonding force measured with the prototype was 2.96 mpa, which was statistically similar to the 3.08 mpa measured in vitro.
5. The adhesive remnant index showed a predominance of score 3, indicating that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after debonding, suggesting that the prototype method is safe for enamel preservation.

1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe childhood epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment, and a poor prognosis.
2. LGS is classified by the International League Against Epilepsy as a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome, with tonic seizures, atonic seizures, and atypical absence seizures being most common.
3. The EEG pattern in LGS typically shows slow spike wave discharges and paroxysms of low voltage fast activity during sleep.
4. Cognitive impairment in LGS ranges from moderate to severe mental retardation, with behavioral disorders such as aggression and autistic features.
5. LGS can be caused by various etiologies, including cortical maldevelopment, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, CNS infection, or neurometabolic disorders.
6. The prognosis of LGS is poor, with a higher risk of poor cognitive outcome associated with symptomatic etiology, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset.
7. Treatment of LGS is challenging due to the heterogeneous causes, frequent occurrence of atypical absence seizures, and evolution of seizure types over time.
8. Valproic acid is considered the first-line medication for LGS, followed by second-line agents like lamotrigine, topiramate, clobazam, felbamate, and levetiracetam.
9. Rufinamide, a new anticonvulsant, has shown efficacy in treating seizures in LGS, with a good safety profile and minimal cognitive side effects.
10. Further studies are needed to establish the role of rufinamide in the treatment algorithm for LGS, considering its potential benefits and limitations.

1. The study investigated the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition and potential reproductive isolation among five distinct populations of the Iberian wall lizard ( Podarcis hispanica) in central Spain, revealing significant morphological differences and variation in the composition of chemical compounds in male femoral gland secretions among populations.
2. Chemosensory recognition tests demonstrated that both male and female lizards could discriminate between scents from different populations, with northern males showing a preference for scents from their own population and southern males for scents from their own area, suggesting possible reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation.
3. The findings indicate that while there is not complete reproductive isolation between all populations, there is evidence of premating reproductive barriers and potential cryptic speciation within the species, warranting further research into mating behaviors and genetic studies to confirm these preliminary observations.

1. Rubella infection during early pregnancy can lead to congenital rubella syndrome ( CRS), affecting the fetus, with a 90% potential of transmission through the placenta.
2. Vaccination of susceptible individuals, particularly women of reproductive age, can prevent rubella and its complications in fetuses.
3. Rubella is endemic in some regions, causing outbreaks in winter and early spring, especially in areas with ineffective childhood vaccination policies or where vaccination only targets females.
4. In closed populations, such as military camps or prisons, the risk of infection is minimized due to previous exposure or vaccination.
5. The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the RA27/3 virus strain, which induces immunity in 95% of vaccinated individuals and closely mimics natural infection immunity.
6. Seroepidemiological studies in various regions, including Iran, have shown significant increases in immunity rates following rubella vaccination campaigns.
7. A study in Kermanshah, Iran, revealed a significant rise in immunity against rubella in vaccinated girls, with less than 1% susceptibility, suggesting no longer a need for pre-marriage screening but recommending periodic seroepidemiological studies to monitor immunity levels.

1. The study demonstrates the use of quantum dots (qds) for nonamplified fluorescent whole mount in situ hybridization (wish) in Xenopus embryos, overcoming limitations of current fluorescent protocols and chromogenic methods, such as poor resolution and the need for enzymatic amplification.
2. The qd wish technique allows for high-resolution, nonamplified detection of endogenous mRNAs, enabling the visualization of mRNA localization patterns within embryos without the need for sectioning, and can be used to create three-dimensional expression maps.
3. The qd wish method is versatile, capable of detecting multiple mRNA transcripts simultaneously, and is suitable for use in various developmental models, including Xenopus, which is highly autofluorescent and challenging for traditional fluorescent in situ hybridization methods.

1. Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers in the United States, with a low five-year survival rate of only about 2%.
2. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential.
3. Surgical resection significantly improves survival for PDAC patients, but less than 20% are suitable for surgery.
4. Cox proportional regression models have been used to estimate the impact of various risk factors on PDAC survival, but their estimates vary based on data quality and model construction.
5. Two nomograms were developed to predict survival and perioperative mortality for PDAC patients, but their utility is limited to patients with resectable PDAC.
6. New cox regression models were developed to estimate survival for resectable and unresectable PDAC, using variables such as age, gender, race, tumor stage, and treatment.
7. An online clinical calculator was developed based on these models to estimate personalized survival probabilities for PDAC patients, but it did not provide standard errors or validate its reliability and generalizability.
8. The present work used SEER data to develop cox proportional hazards regression models for PDAC, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and treatment covariates.
9. The developed models were validated for reproducibility and generalizability using cross-validation and external datasets, and a web-based tool was created to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities in real-time, with standard errors.

1. The study investigated the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis ( CE) using immunoblotting analysis and evaluated the post-operative evolution of patients treated for CE, determining the diagnostic performance of western blot. Blood samples from CE patients, non-CE patients, and healthy controls were analyzed for immunoreactivity against specific antigenic fractions. The study found that antigenic fractions of 52, 24, 39, 46, 63, and 6061 kDa were specific for CE, with the 24 and 39 kDa bands being particularly useful for post-operative monitoring. Western blotting was shown to be a useful method for diagnosing CE and for post-surgical monitoring, as it can detect the disappearance of some bands in post-operative samples, indicating treatment success, and the persistence of other bands, suggesting ongoing infection.
2. The study also highlighted the need for further research to understand the behavior of these antibodies after medical treatment and to confirm the utility of western blotting in clinical practice for the diagnosis and monitoring of CE.

1. The study aimed to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
2. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 66 obese non-diabetic patients, divided into three groups based on BMI (30-40 kg/m^2).
3. The study found that dyslipidemia was prevalent in 90.9% of the patients, with lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the group with class III obesity compared to the other groups.
4. Negative significant correlations were found between BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), while positive significant correlations were found between WC, WHR, and triglycerides (TG) with lipid parameters. The visceral adiposity index (VAI) showed the strongest correlation with TG and HDL-C levels and with lipid indices such as TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C ratios, suggesting that VAI may be the most valuable obesity index in obese patients with dyslipidemias.

1. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of internet addiction and its association with psychopathology among college students in Mumbai, India.
2. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three colleges, covering about 1000 students aged 16-18 years, who had used the internet for at least six months.
3. The study used a semi-structured proforma and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) developed by Kimberly Young in 1998, along with the Duke Health Profile (DHP).
4. The IAT showed very good internal consistency with an alpha coefficient of 0.93, and categorized users into average users, over-users, and addicts based on their scores.
5. The DHP measured various aspects of health, with higher scores indicating better health and lower scores indicating dysfunction.
6. The study found that 24.8% of students were possible addicts and 0.7% were addicts, with males being more likely to be addicted than females.
7. Addicts used the internet predominantly for social networking, chatting, and downloading media files, and more likely in the evenings and nights.
8. Addicts had significantly higher scores of anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression, indicating poorer mental health.
9. The study suggested that internet addiction could be a behavioral problem secondary to another disorder, and highlighted the need for early detection of psychopathology and interventions like setting boundaries.
10. The study concluded that internet addiction is a growing concern among college students in India, with potential implications for mental health and well-being.

1. The frequency response of the resonators was measured using a downmixing method, with the drive signal set to half the actuation frequency to ensure the resonator's motion amplitude was proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
2. A bias voltage was applied to downmix the resistance change in the gauges, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier.
3. Measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at room temperature, and the allan deviation was measured in an open-loop configuration to extract frequency stability.
4. The phase of the measured signal was monitored and transformed into frequency fluctuations using the resonator's complete phase response, which was more accurate than a linear approximation.
5. Harmonics at the electricity supply frequency were filtered out during post-processing, and the allan deviation for a given integration time was calculated using a specific equation.
6. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the resonator's response at different frequencies within its bandwidth, using a detailed measurement scheme that included doubled signals and avoided cross-talk.
7. The correlation coefficient of the filtered frequency traces was defined by a specific equation, and the complete phase response of the resonator was used for more accurate results.

1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and aspirin therapy is recommended for CVD prevention by various health organizations.
2. The study aimed to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations for aspirin therapy for CVD prevention in a nationally representative sample.
3. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2011-2012 was used, focusing on adults aged 40 and older, to assess whether individuals were recommended or taking aspirin for CVD prevention.
4. The study found that less than a third of individuals at high risk for CVD were recommended to take aspirin by their physicians, and over three-quarters of primary prevention patients were classified as low risk.
5. Among those told to take aspirin, the vast majority complied with the recommendation, with 77.4% of the total sample, 79.0% of high-risk patients, and 76.5% of low-risk patients reporting taking aspirin.
6. The study also found significant differences in demographic and access to care variables by race among primary prevention patients, with non-Hispanic whites more likely to receive a recommendation for aspirin than Asians/Others.
7. The study concluded that recommendations for aspirin use do not match up to the objectively computed future risk, and there is a need for improved clinical decision support to ensure that patients receive appropriate preventive care.

1. The study presents an in situ hybridization ( ish) technique using a locked nucleic acid ( lna) probe and a biotin - free tyramide amplification system ( csaii) for detecting hepatitis C virus ( hcv) RNA in formalin - fixed, paraffin - embedded ( ffpe) liver tissues, which is considered more reliable than current methods.
2. The technique was validated using humanized livers from hcv-infected chimeric mice and human liver biopsy specimens from chronic hepatitis c patients, showing high sensitivity and specificity. The ish technique detected hcv RNA in 9 out of 11 chronic hepatitis c lesions, with some cases showing diffuse cytoplasmic positivity.
3. The study concludes that the lna-based ish technique, which is relatively simple and does not require special equipment, can be a valuable tool for the routine histopathological diagnosis of hcv infection using ffpe liver biopsy specimens, with sensitivity comparable to in situ reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr).

1. Concerns exist about the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on wildlife and humans, with many chemicals shown to alter the thyroid system in vertebrates.
2. The thyroid axis, regulated by thyroid hormones (THs), is crucial for amphibian metamorphosis, making frogs a suitable model for testing chemicals that may disrupt this system.
3. The thyroid gland secretes THs, which are transported in the blood and metabolized in the liver, with various processes influencing TH balance.
4. Environmental contaminants can disrupt TH metabolism by affecting enzymes involved in TH synthesis, secretion, and transport, leading to altered TH levels.
5. Amphibian thyroid transport protein (TTR) has a higher affinity for TH3 than TH4, and chemicals that bind to TTR can diminish cellular uptake and biological responses, altering TH homeostasis.
6. The amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) uses Xenopus laevis tadpoles to assess the effects of chemicals on TH-mediated metamorphosis, with several endpoints including mortality, developmental stage, hind limb length, snout-vent length, wet body weight, and thyroid gland histology.
7. Validation studies have shown that thyroid gland histopathology is sensitive and reliable for detecting antithyroidal activity but less useful for weak agonistic effects.
8. The thyroid gland undergoes morphological changes throughout metamorphosis, with follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia occurring at climax stages when TH levels are high.
9. Proper staging of larvae is essential for accurate histological analysis, and misinterpretation can lead to incorrect conclusions about the effects of chemicals on the thyroid gland.

1. The study aimed to explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related quality of life ( hrqol).
2. A prospective study was conducted from August 2007 to October 2008, involving 365 pregnant women in Kashan, Iran, who gave informed consent and completed a health survey and hrqol questionnaire at 2 and 4 months postpartum.
3. The study included women with singleton, live-born infants, term pregnancies, no pre-existing diseases, and prenatal care started before 20 weeks gestation.
4. The women were divided into two groups: 175 with vaginal delivery (VD) and 167 with cesarean section (CS), with 150 from each group completing the questionnaires at both time points.
5. The study found that women with VD had higher total physical health scores at both 2 and 4 months postpartum compared to the CS group.
6. Mental health scores were generally higher in the CS group at 4 months postpartum, but differences were not significant.
7. The VD group showed more improvement in total mental health scores from 2 to 4 months postpartum, with significant differences in social functioning and emotional well-being subscales.
8. The study suggests that VD leads to better physical health at 2 months and both physical and mental health at 4 months postpartum, recommending future studies to include specific questionnaires and consider social and cultural factors affecting postpartum hrqol.

1. Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, proposed in 1943, categorizes human needs into physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization, with safety needs being more fundamental than physiological needs.
2. Safety needs encompass personal security, financial security, and health and well-being, and are essential for survival, even more so than physiological needs like food and sex.
3. Maslow observed that safety needs can dominate behavior, leading to a safety-seeking mechanism, and that these needs are prioritized over physiological needs when they are threatened.
4. The concept of negativity bias, where potential threats are amplified and processed faster than rewards, supports the idea that safety needs are more fundamental than hedonic needs.
5. Emotions like fear and anger are rapid responses to unexpected threats, serving as a safety check, and are related to the amygdala and locus coeruleus (LC) systems in the brain, which are involved in the fight-or-flight response and conditioned learning of these emotions.
6. Mental disorders such as anxiety, phobia, depression, and PTSD are often linked to unmet safety needs, with the amygdala and LC/NE system playing a crucial role in the emotional and behavioral responses to perceived threats.

1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), particularly 14,15-EET, are involved in various physiological functions and are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.
2. EETs are susceptible to oxidation, requiring careful handling and storage to maintain stability.
3. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) can increase EET levels, offering a pharmacological intervention approach.
4. Previous EET surrogates, including oxamides and n-ipr-amides, showed agonist activity but modest SEH inhibition.
5. Conjugation with poly(ethylene oxide) improved EET analogues' vasorelaxation and SEH inhibition.
6. Attachment of the carboxylate to nitrogen atoms of glycine or aspartic acid enhanced vasoactivity and SEH inhibition.
7. Sulfonate and phenylsulfonamide derivatives showed variable effects on vasorelaxation and SEH inhibition.
8. Tetrazole and thioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazol derivatives improved EET analogues' potency and SEH inhibition.
9. The isomeric thioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazol derivative was a poor SEH inhibitor but improved vasorelaxation.
10. The 2,4-thiazolidinedione modification in n-(4-hydroxy-2-benzothiazolyl)acetamide analogues did not improve potency but increased the chain length resembling EETs.

1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model, an extension of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), aims to improve the quality and coordination of healthcare, reduce costs, and increase access to services. Despite challenges in transitioning to PCMH, over 1,500 sites and 7,700 clinicians in the U.S. have successfully achieved National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recognition, with the goal of better serving patients and addressing primary care crisis and evolving payment opportunities.
2. The transition to PCMH involves understanding and documenting implementation guidelines, promoting physician buy-in, changing office culture, implementing team-based care, and leveraging electronic medical records (EMRs). Challenges include physician resistance due to reimbursement issues, the need for staff training, and the allocation of resources. Successes include improved patient care, reduced hospital admissions, and the potential for future payment reform that rewards quality care improvements.

1. The survival rate of cardiac arrest patients outside the hospital remained at 78% in the early 21st century, with only a quarter regaining pulses and one-third surviving hospitalization.
2. Mild hypothermia therapy has been proposed to protect the brain and improve survival and neurological function, but recent clinical trials showed mixed results.
3. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mild hypothermia in patients with cardiac arrest, using six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met specific inclusion criteria.
4. The pooled results showed no significant difference in survival rate at hospital discharge between the hypothermia and control groups, but a significant difference in survival rate after 6 months favored the hypothermia group.
5. The pooled results also showed no significant difference in neurological function at hospital discharge between the hypothermia and control groups, but a significant difference in neurological function after 6 months favored the hypothermia group.
6. Mild hypothermia did not influence the incidence of rearrest, and there was no significant difference in other adverse events compared to the control group.

1. Varicocele is a condition characterized by persistent enlargement and elongation of the pampiniform plexus, venous convolution, and sinus formation, leading to transient or permanent backflow of blood and potentially affecting testicular function.
2. The etiopathogenesis of varicocele is unclear, but it is associated with blood turbulence near the testicular vein, resulting in retrograde flow of renal metabolites and adrenal hormones to the testis, causing venous stasis, hyperemia, and compromised oxygen concentration.
3. Varicocele can impair spermatogenesis, potentially due to increased scrotal temperature or tissue hypoxia, leading to testicular growth arrest in children and adolescents.
4. Diagnosis of varicocele is based on physical examination and grading on the Dubin-Amler scale, with color doppler ultrasound confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity.
5. Laparoscopic varicocele repair via a transperitoneal approach, involving division of the testicular vein, is indicated for varicocele with testicular hypotrophy.
6. A retrospective study of 68 adolescents who underwent laparoscopic varicocele repair showed significant postoperative increase in testicular volume on the affected side in 83.8% of patients, with normalization of semen parameters in 85.2% of patients.
7. The study supports the efficacy of laparoscopic varicocele repair in improving testicular volume and semen parameters, with normal hormone levels in young men post-surgery, indicating the advisability of surgical correction for the vascular lesion.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and joint destruction, with potential extra-articular complications and increased cardiovascular ( CV) and renal disease risks.
2. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein that increases during inflammation and is associated with RA activity, CV disease, and amyloidosis.
3. The study aimed to assess SAA concentration in RA patients with different disease activity levels, alongside other inflammatory, metabolic, and CV/renal disease risk factors.
4. A total of 140 RA patients were included, with varying disease activity and treatment regimens.
5. SAA levels were significantly higher in men, patients with high disease activity, those treated with glucocorticoids, and those with atherosclerotic plaques or increased cystatin C (Cys-C) levels.
6. Women treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) had significantly lower SAA levels, suggesting better therapeutic effects of bDMARDs.
7. High SAA levels were inversely associated with corrected QT (QTc) duration, indicating an increased CV risk in RA patients with elevated SAA levels.

1. Glucocorticoids are known for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, but also play a role in promoting Th2-type immunity and inflammation, particularly in the context of stress and allergic diseases like asthma.
2. Chronic stress and glucocorticoid stimulation are associated with increased eosinophil production, a key feature of asthma, which can be modulated by oral tolerance to allergens.
3. Studies have shown that endogenous glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone, play a critical role in the hematological response to allergen challenge, with glucocorticoid blockade abolishing the bone marrow eosinophilia induced by allergen challenge.
4. Similarly, a corticosterone surge induced by mild surgical trauma also leads to bone marrow eosinophilia, which is also abolished by glucocorticoid blockade.
5. In a mouse model, perforin-deficient mice showed a selective defect in granulocyte production, which was corrected by transfer of wild-type lymphocytes from naive donors.
6. The defect in granulocyte production in perforin-deficient mice was not due to a general lack of response to glucocorticoids, as the thymus of these mice responded to dexamethasone treatment.
7. The ability of wild-type lymphocyte transfer to reconstitute the dexamethasone response suggests that perforin may be involved in the regulation of granulocyte lineages in vivo, and that lymphocytes from the spleen of naive mice can interact with glucocorticoid receptors to stimulate granulopoiesis.

1. Over the past decade, various cell types have been evaluated for cardiac regeneration, with embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts, and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells being extensively studied, alongside induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and resident cardiac stem cells.
2. ESCs can differentiate into cardiovascular lineages and have shown promising results in rodent models, but concerns about teratoma formation and ethical issues have hindered clinical trials. iPSCs, generated from adult somatic cells, offer a potential alternative with similar differentiation capabilities and reduced tumorigenesis risks.
3. MSCs, which can differentiate into cardiomyocytes under specific conditions, have shown improved ventricular function in clinical trials but are limited by their tendency to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues. Skeletal myoblasts, while less prone to teratoma formation, have not shown true cardiomyocyte differentiation in vivo and have limited benefits in large-scale clinical trials. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells have demonstrated improved ventricular function in clinical trials but face controversy regarding their fate post-transplantation.
4. The optimal route and timing of stem cell delivery remain challenges, with non-invasive mobilization, intracoronary infusion, and intramyocardial injection being current methods. Studies suggest that intracoronary delivery may be superior, but intramyocardial delivery may offer more targeted therapy without the need for patent coronary arteries.
5. Strategies to improve stem cell homing and survival include ex vivo conditioning of donor cells, in vivo conditioning of the host vasculature, and genetic modification of donor cells to overexpress survival or growth factors. These approaches aim to enhance cardiac retention, reduce non-cardiac tissue engraftment, and improve outcomes, potentially allowing for increased stem cell dosages and improved per-cell outcomes.

1. Polyhalite, a mineral commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions, was first described in the salt mine Bad Ischl in Austria and has since been known from various salt deposits.
2. The crystal structure of polyhalite was determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria, and its formation conditions and stability were studied by various researchers.
3. Polyhalite commonly forms early diagenetically by reactions of k  mg  cl 
 so4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite, after prolonged contact with the precursor rock.
4. Polyhalite is stable between room temperature and 255-343°C, making it useful for absolute age dating to decipher the geological history of a region.
5. In the Hallstatt mine, located within the lower triassic Haselgebirge formation of the Northern Calcareous Alps, polyhalite occurs in various microfabric types, revealing a wide variety of fabric types.
6. The polyhalite microfabrics from Hallstatt include vein-filling fibrous polyhalite of likely middle to late Triassic age, polyhalite mylonites of early cretaceous age, metamorphic reaction fabrics of post-early cretaceous age, and cavity-filling polyhalite of uncertain age.
7. The polyhalite mylonites contain a wide range of shear fabrics commonly known in mylonitic quartzofeldspathic shear zones within the ductile crust, developed from a more coarse-grained precursor rock.
8. Metamorphic reaction fabrics (microfabric type b-2) of fine-grained polyhalite seams, which have grown due to the decomposition of bldite (or astrakhanite) and anhydrite, have also been found.
9. For the first time, microfabrics like mylonitic shear fabrics, porphyroclast systems, annealing, etc., are demonstrated to be preserved in relatively rare sulphates like polyhalite, which is stable between low temperatures and 255°C.

1. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( ihh ) is a rare condition with a prevalence of about 1/10,000 in men and 1/50,000 in women, often diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood.
2. Due to its rarity, comprehensive assessment of ihh is challenging for individual clinical centers, leading to the use of multicenter trials which are resource-intensive and time-consuming.
3. Advances in information technology have enabled the formation of disease-specific social groups, facilitating medical research through networks.
4. The study utilized a network-based approach to collect clinical data on ihh patients in China, involving a questionnaire survey and analysis of medical records.
5. The survey included demographic characteristics, family history, age, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, therapeutic protocols, developmental stage, sexual function, hormone levels, and quality of life (QoL) assessments.
6. The study found that 84% of ihh patients were diagnosed in general hospitals, with a mean age of onset at 15.2 years and a mean disease duration of 12.1 years.
7. The majority of patients had hyposmia or anosmia, and all presented with pubertal delay.
8. Hormone replacement therapy was administered to 68 patients, with varying protocols including testosterone (T), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), or a combination of these hormones.
9. The study found that gonadotropin + androgen replacement therapy (g + a group) was superior to gonadotropin therapy alone (g group) in terms of penis length, pubic hair growth, laryngeal prominence development, and testosterone normalization rate.
10. The study concluded that network investigation can be an effective alternative method for medical research, with the potential to improve understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases like ihh.

1. Nonsurgical endodontic retreatment aims to eliminate microbial content from failed teeth, but well-compacted root fillings can impair disinfection and reshaping due to resistance to retreatment instruments.
2. Studies indicate that universal protaper rotary files (rfs) are not always successful in completely removing root canal fillings, leading to potential extrusion of irritants into the periapical region.
3. The current study evaluated the extrusion of debris apically after using protaper universal rfs and different finishing files (protaper next (ptn), wave one (wo), and self-adjusting file (saf)) for removing residual root canal fillings.
4. The null hypothesis tested was that the three supplementary files would show no significant differences in the amount of debris extruded.
5. The study involved a twofold retreatment protocol, with the initial use of protaper universal rfs followed by the use of supplementary files.
6. The results showed that the wave one (wo) file caused significantly more apical debris extrusion compared to protaper next (ptn) and self-adjusting file (saf), with the saf group showing the least extrusion of debris.
7. The study concluded that all retreatment systems cause apical debris extrusion, but saf instrumentation resulted in the least extrusion, followed by ptn and wo.
8. The study suggests using supplementary files for finishing after using rfs to refine the apical preparation and facilitate removal of residual root canal fillings, thereby reducing apical debris extrusion.

1. The maxillary teeth can be anesthetized with troncular techniques or intraosseous and intraligamentary injections, but a single injection technique that anesthetizes multiple maxillary teeth without facial numbness has not been described in the literature.
2. Friedman and Hochman proposed the anterior and middle superior alveolar ( amsa ) nerve block technique, which theoretically anesthetizes maxillary teeth from the central incisor to the second premolar without facial muscle interference, but studies using computer-controlled systems showed variable success rates.
3. This study aimed to determine the success rates of pulpal anesthesia with the amsa nerve block technique using a conventional syringe in 30 patients, revealing success rates ranging from 16.7 to 66.6% for the experimental teeth.
4. The amsa nerve block technique with a conventional syringe showed limited success in achieving pulpal anesthesia in the maxillary central incisor, lateral incisor, canine, and first and second premolars, with no facial numbness reported, but the technique is disadvantageous for clinical application as the first choice due to variable success rates and duration of anesthesia.

1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome, which is fundamental in regulating gene expression and DNA replication.
2. The genome is folded hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), where specific long-range interactions occur.
3. TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit a higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions and are stable across species, cell types, and conditions.
4. TAD boundaries are associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and replication timing, and are regulated by architectural proteins like BEAF32 and TFIIIC.
5. The strength of TAD boundaries is influenced by the binding of insulators, with strong boundaries limiting interactions between adjacent TADs and weak boundaries allowing more inter-TAD interactions.
6. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, is required for nucleosome occupancy and positioning, and for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions.
7. BRG1 knockdown in mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells led to differential expression of genes related to extracellular matrix and lipid synthesis, and a reduction in the strength of TAD boundaries, as assessed by increased inter-TAD genomic interactions.
8. ChIP-seq analysis showed that BRG1 primarily binds at genic regions, with intergenic BRG1 peaks including super-enhancers, suggesting a role in TAD boundary regulation.

1. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new three-dimensional imaging method that visualizes the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPOs) using static and dynamic magnetic fields, offering high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios.
2. MPI has potential applications in cardiovascular imaging and interventions, but requires suitable tracer materials with long circulation times in blood.
3. The hydrodynamic diameter of SPOs influences their pharmacokinetics and the quality of the MPI signal, with smaller particles (around 30 nm in iron core diameter) being ideal for MPI.
4. Resovist, a t2* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI, but has a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 50 nm, leading to rapid clearance from the bloodstream.
5. The aim of the study was to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), as it may differ significantly from the blood half-life in MRI.
6. The study compared the blood half-life of MPI using Resovist from two different distributors: Bayer Pharma AG in Europe and Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in Japan.
7. MPS showed that the MPI signal of Resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd declined more rapidly than that from Bayer Pharma AG, with a significant difference in signal decay between the two types of Resovist.
8. Photon cross-correlation spectroscopy revealed no significant difference in hydrodynamic diameter or size distribution between the two Resovist products, suggesting that the difference in blood half-life is not due to particle size.
9. The study concluded that Resovist is not suitable as an intravascular tracer for MPI due to its rapid clearance from the bloodstream, and highlighted the need for a dedicated MPI tracer with a prolonged blood half-life of its MPI signal.

1. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are intracellular energy and carbon storage compounds synthesized by bacteria and archaea under nutrient-limited conditions, with potential applications due to their structural diversity.
2. PHAs are classified into short-chain-length (SCL-PHAs) and medium-chain-length (MCL-PHAs) based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units, with SCL-PHAs consisting of monomers with 35 carbon atoms and MCL-PHAs with 614 carbon atoms.
3. The study aimed to determine if bacteria in Antarctic freshwater reservoirs have the potential to synthesize PHAs, focusing on the presence of specific pha synthase genes and their correlation with environmental conditions.
4. A total of 50 bacterial isolates were characterized, with the majority belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum, including Pseudomonas and Janthinobacterium genera.
5. The study found that six Pseudomonas strains and two Janthinobacterium strains possessed genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis, while two Janthinobacterium strains had genes for both SCL- and MCL-PHA synthesis.
6. Comparative analysis of 16s rrna and pha synthase genes suggested that the genes responsible for PHA synthesis in Antarctic strains were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer rather than gradual evolution.

3. A mixed plant community with the same ratio of functional groups as a natural community is needed for successful re-vegetation.
4. The study aimed to estimate the frequency of successful establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses in southern Arizona using 31 years of historical rainfall data.
5. A land surface model simulated soil moisture for the 31-year period, considering rainfall event data, soil moisture movement, and evaporation, with inputs from the Santa Rita Experimental Range.
6. The model showed six times more potential for seeding success than the 10% estimate by Cox and Jordan (1983) for southern Arizona, with 20 and 22 years of successful establishment in the first 19 days after germination for two-day and three-day scenarios, respectively.

1. Small RNAs play a critical role in gene regulation, and RNA interference (RNAi) can downregulate mRNAs through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RNAi can also modulate gene transcription through chromatin remodeling. Small promoter-targeted RNAs (sarna) have been shown to activate transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAa).
2. A bioinformatic approach was developed to design sarna candidates for upregulation of specific cellular genes, focusing on genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming.
3. The Klf4 and c-Myc genes, key reprogramming factors, were targeted for activation using sarna. Potential antisense transcripts from the Klf4 and c-Myc loci were identified using genomic data and spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
4. Candidate sarna sequences were designed using the gpboost algorithm to effectively target and degrade antisense transcripts, with the hypothesis that this would activate gene expression.
5. Klf4-pr1 and c-Myc-pr2 sarna candidates were tested in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Klf4-pr1 significantly upregulated Klf4 expression, while c-Myc-pr2 upregulated c-Myc expression.
6. RNA sequencing and real-time PCR confirmed that sarna-mediated upregulation was due to transcriptional activation, not post-transcriptional mechanisms.
7. Microarray analysis showed concordant regulation of cellular genes between sarna and viral transduction for Klf4 and c-Myc, but some discordant regulation for other genes. Pathway analysis suggested that differences were due to cellular changes in response to transfection versus viral transduction.
8. Klf4-pr1 sarna upregulated endogenous pluripotency factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Klf4) in MSCs.

1. Autophagy, a bulk degradation system, is crucial for host defense responses by promoting the elimination of pathogens and the induction of acquired immunity. It is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses through the coordinated action of autophagy-related proteins (atgs), which mediate the formation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes.
2. Autophagy plays a critical role in antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells, with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules localized on autophagosomes. Atgs are essential for the presentation of viral and self-antigens by MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T cells and the presentation of viral antigens by MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells.
3. Autophagy is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. The loss of autophagy regulators, such as atg16l1, leads to the enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines in response to endotoxin. This is mediated by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of caspase-1, which processes pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1.
4. Autophagy is also implicated in the response to nucleic acid-containing antigens. The translocation and assembly of signal transducers like TBK1 and STING (stimulator of IFN genes) are required for the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines in response to DNA-containing antigens. The involvement of autophagy in this process is suggested by the enhanced assembly of STING and TBK1 in the absence of autophagy regulators, leading to aberrant activation of the innate immune response.

1. Patient blood management, particularly in cardiac surgery, is crucial due to the associated risks of transfusions, such as increased morbidity and mortality, infections, and the depletion of blood bank resources. Patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at higher risk of postoperative bleeding, which can lead to serious complications.
2. The use of antiplatelet agents like aspirin and clopidogrel in cardiac patients presents a dilemma, as these drugs can increase bleeding risks during surgery, yet they are essential for preventing ischemic events. Current guidelines suggest discontinuing these medications before elective cardiac surgery to minimize bleeding risks.
3. Optimal perioperative fluid management and maintaining normovolaemia are vital to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. In cardiac surgery, maintaining a haemoglobin level of around 6.0 g/dL (3.7 mmol/L) is generally recommended, but this may be higher for patients with coronary artery disease. Indicators of inadequate oxygenation, such as tachycardia, hypotension, high oxygen extraction fraction, and low mixed venous oxygen partial pressure, should guide transfusion decisions. Institutions should develop transfusion policies and guidelines, considering the balance between blood conservation and patient safety.

1. Progressive diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob affect millions worldwide, with a significant impact on life expectancy and quality of life. These diseases share common features such as the misfolding and aggregation of distinct polypeptides, which can spread from cell to cell, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of disease progression.
2. Proteins within cells typically fold correctly with the help of molecular chaperones, but misfolding can occur due to errors in synthesis, processing, or stress. Molecular chaperones attempt to refold or degrade misfolded proteins, but under stress, the system can become overwhelmed, leading to protein aggregation and disease.
3. Protein aggregates can cause cellular dysfunction and death through various mechanisms, including membrane permeabilization, disruption of membrane protein dynamics, formation of pathogenic signaling platforms, and sequestration of molecular chaperones and other proteins.
4. Recent evidence suggests that protein aggregation and transmission in neurodegenerative diseases occur in a prion-like manner, with aggregates acting as infectious agents that can propagate and amplify disease.
5. The toxicity of protein aggregates is linked to their ability to bind and permeabilize cell membranes, induce inflammation, and sequester soluble proteins, leading to further aggregation and cellular dysfunction.
6. The concept of protein strains, similar to prion strains, has been proposed for alpha-synuclein (α-syn), tau, and amyloid-beta (Aβ), with distinct aggregates associated with different neurodegenerative diseases and pathological phenotypes. These strains may have different binding affinities, toxicities, and seeding capacities, potentially contributing to disease heterogeneity.

Hepatitis C virus ( HCV) related morbidity and mortality is significant in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), affecting approximately 3.2 million people in the United States, with African Americans (AA) being twice as likely to be infected and having historically lower response rates to approved interferon (IFN)-based therapies.
2. A prospective study aimed to evaluate the effect of IFN-based therapies on outcomes in AA patients, identifying 346 AA patients with HCV genotype 1 who were followed for an average of 8 years.
3. The study confirmed that a significant number of patients had a good correlation between early liver biopsy results and both the aspartate amino transferase (AST) platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) assays, validating them as useful surrogate markers for fibrosis in AA patients.
4. The study found that permanent viral elimination (defined as sustained virologic response, SVR) with IFN-based treatment in AA patients with CHC protected them from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and reversed fibrosis.
5. Patients who achieved SVR did not develop HCC, regardless of gender, and the response to therapy was similar for both genders.
6. The study also confirmed that cirrhosis at the first visit in AA was not predictive of HCC development, and only fibrosis, as defined by biopsy at the first visit, was moderately predictive of HCC.
7. The study concluded that elimination of the virus remains the optimal goal of therapy for AA patients with CHC, and that surveillance in patients with significant fibrosis, rather than just cirrhosis, is warranted.

1. The rapid expansion of medical knowledge and the prevalence of unanswered questions in clinical practice highlight the need for evidence-based medicine ( EBM) to bridge the gap between research and routine care. EBM integrates the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values to improve decision-making in healthcare.
2. Despite the benefits of EBM, several factors hinder its implementation, necessitating the development of a national evidence-based healthcare system ( EBHCS) to ensure the generation, storage, use, and monitoring of evidence for effective and safe services. The EBHCS comprises three subsystems: the national system of clinical knowledge management, the national evidence-based practice system, and the integrated national network of clinical effectiveness.
3. The EBHCS aims to promote clinical effectiveness, patient safety, and health outcomes by providing local knowledge required for evidence-based clinical decision-making, institutionalizing the application of knowledge products, and facilitating evidence-based practice through a systematic process. The implementation of this model requires strategies and methods tailored to the country's context, involving stakeholders at various levels and ensuring governmental support and intervention.

2. Biomarkers for delirium could improve its recognition and care, with oxidative stress and neurotransmission disturbances potentially involved in its pathophysiology.
3. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for serotonin and dopamine production and nitric oxide synthesis in the central nervous system.
4. The study aimed to investigate BH4 status, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and nitric oxide production in patients with and without delirium.
5. Blood samples were collected from 86 patients, with 23 diagnosed with delirium. The study measured amino acid levels, phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratio, tryptophan/large neutral amino acids (Trp/LNAAS) ratio, and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels.
6. Patients with delirium had higher Phe/Tyr ratios, lower Trp/LNAAS ratios, and lower levels of arginine and citrulline compared to those without delirium.
7. The study found no significant difference in HVA levels between patients with and without delirium.
8. The findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and increased oxidative stress may play a role in delirium pathogenesis. Confirmation in a larger population and further research on the pathophysiology of delirium in patients with and without cognitive disorders are recommended.

1. The study re-examines Valerie Oppenheimer's theory on the influence of men's economic position on marriage timing in a European context, using panel data from 13 European countries. It confirms that men's employment status, work experience, and income significantly affect the likelihood of entering a union and the choice between cohabitation and marriage, with employment and income effects being stronger in more traditional societies. The findings suggest that while cohabitation is more sensitive to economic uncertainty, marriage is more influenced by men's economic position, with the poorest men being less likely to enter a union. The study also finds that the effects of men's economic characteristics on marriage formation are weaker in more egalitarian societies, where the costs of setting up a household are more often shared between partners.
2. The research highlights the importance of considering both men's and women's economic positions in understanding marriage and cohabitation trends, as traditional and egalitarian societies show different patterns in how men's economic status affects union formation and transitions. The study suggests that in more egalitarian societies, the economic uncertainty hypothesis may be less applicable, and that the costs of setting up a household are more often shared, allowing for greater flexibility in career experimentation.

1. Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength leading to increased fracture risk, influenced by bone mass and quality, which depends on bone's macro- and microarchitecture and intrinsic properties like matrix mineralization and collagen quality.
2. Bone remodeling, a process involving osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, maintains bone structure and mechanical competence by removing damaged bone and replacing it with new bone, but diseases and drugs affecting these cells can disrupt this balance, leading to bone loss and increased fracture risk.
3. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting young adults, primarily women, and can lead to functional impairments, reduced mobility, and long-term glucocorticoid (GCS) treatment, all of which contribute to bone remodeling imbalance and increased fracture risk.
4. Studies have shown that MS patients have lower bone mineral density (BMD) compared to healthy controls, with vertebral BMD being more affected than femoral BMD, and a higher prevalence of fractures in MS patients, especially those with progressive forms of the disease.
5. The pathogenesis of osteoporosis in MS patients is likely multifactorial, involving immobilization, long-term GCS treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly inflammatory cytokines, with the level of disability being a significant risk factor for bone loss.
6. Preventive and therapeutic strategies for MS patients at risk of osteoporosis should include assessment of clinical risk factors, BMD measurement, and individualized interventions, such as weight-bearing exercise, nutrition, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and potentially pharmacological treatments like bisphosphonates or anabolic agents like teriparatide, considering the unique etiology of osteoporosis in MS patients.

3. Malaria caused by P. vivax or P. ovale is treated with chloroquine and primaquine, with specific dosages for prevention and treatment.
4. Primaquine is the only antimalarial effective against all Plasmodium species gametocytes and hypnozoites, but it can cause hemolysis, especially in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
5. Common malaria symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, weakness, headache, arthralgia, and back pain, while gastrointestinal symptoms are less frequent.
6. The study in Mâncio Lima, Brazil, included 50 patients with vivax malaria, revealing a significant reduction in fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain after treatment, but an increase in gastrointestinal symptoms and choluria.
7. Side effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal discomfort, while primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia, particularly in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
8. The study found that chloroquine and primaquine treatment can lead to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and hemolysis, potentially reducing treatment adherence.
9. It is important to warn patients of possible side effects and seek measures to minimize them, such as using antihistamines or antiemetics.

1. The study aimed to investigate the effects of concomitant treatment with the alpha-blocker tamsulosin and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin on erectile function in male patients aged 40 years or older with lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) , benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , and erectile dysfunction ( ED). Sixty patients were divided into two groups, with one group receiving tamsulosin alone and the other receiving both tamsulosin and solifenacin for 3 months. The International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were used to assess erectile function and LUTS, respectively. The study found that concomitant treatment with tamsulosin and solifenacin effectively improved LUTS without significantly improving erectile function.
2. The study concluded that while the concomitant use of alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics may improve LUTS in patients with BPH and ED, it is not expected to significantly improve sexual function. Further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of combined treatment on sexual function in these patients.

2. Differences in mirna expression profiles have been documented in normal versus cancerous tissues of the endometrium, breast, and ovary.
3. Mirnas can regulate the expression of numerous proteins, including those involved in cancer-relevant pathways like apoptosis, migration, and metastasis, making them potential cancer biomarkers.
4. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process where cells lose epithelial characteristics and gain mesenchymal traits, aiding in cancer metastasis.
5. Zeb1 and Zeb2, transcription factors involved in EMT, repress e-cadherin expression and promote mesenchymal traits, but are normally not expressed in epithelial cells.
6. The mir-200 family, including mir-200c, represses Zeb1/2 and mesenchymal genes, maintaining epithelial characteristics in normal tissues.
7. Zeb1 can repress mir-200 family members, creating a feedback loop that allows for plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal states.
8. In aggressive cancers, mir-200c is often lost, leading to increased Zeb1 expression, loss of e-cadherin, and mesenchymal traits.
9. Restoration of mir-200c in cancer cells reduces migration and invasion, independent of e-cadherin restoration, and decreases adhesion to basement membrane components.
10. Loss of mir-200c is associated with chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, with mir-200c-mediated repression of tubulin 3 (Tubb3) being the mechanism behind increased sensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents like paclitaxel.

2. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator mus procedures.
3. Traditional anatomical dissections do not allow the study of the midurethral sling's (MUS) configuration in relation to the urethra, as they only allow visualization at a single level each time.
4. This cadaveric study aimed to compare the spatial relationships between the in-out and out-in MUS and the female urethra using computed tomography (CT) scan image analysis.
5. Tantalum wires were threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-based MUS tapes to allow radiographic visualization of their entire trajectory.
6. The study found that the in-out MUS tapes angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach, which seemed to follow a more horizontal, flatter trajectory.
7. The in-out MUS tapes were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the out-in MUS tapes.
8. The study confirmed that both obturator mus approaches were demonstrated to be u-shaped bands that head backwards or dorsally, contrary to the belief that the urethra is suspended in a cranially directed U-shaped band.
9. The study highlighted the need for strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique for both approaches and suggested that the in-out approach may be associated with a higher variability in outcomes.

1. The team discussed the market potential for a new remote control, focusing on consumer preferences and potential profitability. They found that 75% of users dislike the current remote controls' appearance, indicating a need for aesthetically pleasing designs, and 80% are willing to pay more for attractive remotes. The team also considered the importance of simplicity in design, as 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons on existing remotes. They discussed the feasibility of incorporating features like speech recognition and a glow-in-the-dark aspect, but ultimately decided against the more complex and potentially costly T_F_T_ display due to its fragility and the potential for it to make the remote obsolete. They agreed on a remote with speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design, and programmability, with a focus on safety and durability for children. The remote will also feature a yellow color scheme with a small logo for branding, and the team will explore the use of glow-in-the-dark material as a gimmick.
2. The team also discussed the importance of ergonomics and user-friendly design, considering the needs of a broad age range, particularly those between 15 and 35 years old. They concluded that the remote should be hand-held, portable, and have a simple interface with programmable options for favorite channels and volume settings. They decided against teletext and glow-in-the-dark materials that require charging, opting instead for a durable material that can withstand being thrown around. They also considered a remote feedback feature but ultimately decided against it to avoid redundancy with the television's built-in speaker.

1. The Welsh Government, through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), is committed to self-evaluation and external verification to improve Welsh education, with the OECD's latest report expected to be published in March and a statement to follow. The powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 have been used by local authorities to intervene in schools, with varying effectiveness, and the national evaluation and improvement resource is being developed to enhance self-evaluation across Wales. The investment in school standards has been significant, with 50% of the budget directed towards professional learning for teachers. The Welsh Government has not used its intervention powers but encourages local authorities to take a proactive approach. The national evaluation and improvement resource, renamed to avoid the impression of a checklist, aims to build skills for robust self-evaluation and is being tested across the system. The Welsh Government is also addressing concerns about schools needing support through a new multi-agency approach, and while the categorisation system has evolved, it continues to be a primary tool for identifying schools needing support. The Education through Regional Working (ERW) consortium is an example of the value of regional consortia in delivering school improvement services, and the Welsh Government is working with local authorities to ensure consistent and effective support for schools.
