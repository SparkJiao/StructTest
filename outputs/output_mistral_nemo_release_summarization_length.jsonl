Spin-based devices offer potential advantages such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation compared to charge-based devices. In 1994, a scheme for a spintronic NAND gate using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed. However, these devices face challenges in pipelined architectures due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction, which can lead to metastable states and prevent logic signal propagation. Solutions proposed to overcome this include increasing the distance between cells and using multi-phase clocking, but these methods have their own limitations. Quantum dots with high densities can be achieved using electrochemical techniques, but the power dissipation of spin-based devices remains a challenge. Reversible logic gates and quantum computing using spin qubits offer potential solutions to overcome these challenges. Optical readout of spin qubits is a more practical approach than electrical readout due to the lack of need for contacts.

Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experiences directed transport, and there's interest in extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems. Recent attention has been focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, with chaotic systems being sensitive to initial conditions. The behavior of nonlinear systems, including transitions from regular to chaotic behavior, is complex and depends on system parameters. A few years ago, Mateos considered a specific ratchet model and showed that the current could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. He conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior. However, later investigations argued that current reversals could occur without bifurcations, and proposed an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. This paper investigates the impact of different ensembles of particles on the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet and finds that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble. It also shows that it's important to discard transients in quantifying the current. The paper discusses the connection between bifurcation diagrams for individual particles and the behavior of the current, finding that while many details of Barbieri and Salerno's results are disagreed with, the broader conclusion still holds. The transport properties of a chaotic ratchet are not as simple as the initial conjecture, but there's evidence for a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture: bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current, which may lead to a net current reversal but not necessarily so. The goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets by considering specific systems in great detail before generalizing.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

However, there are degrees of non-classicality, with quantum systems being non-separable if their states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states, and being Bell non-local if their measurement correlations violate Bell inequalities. EPR steering is a weaker form of non-locality, where one party can demonstrate steering by showing that the correlations cannot be described by a local hidden state model. The paper investigates the EPR steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals, known as T-states. The authors develop a deterministic local hidden state model for projective measurements on these states, which they conjecture is optimal. They also derive two sufficient conditions for EPR steerability via steering inequalities, one of which is a new asymmetric inequality for the spin covariance matrix. The necessary condition for EPR steerability is a surface in the space of T-states, with the sufficient conditions touching this surface in some regions.

This suggests that some short-lived radioisotopes (SLRIs) may have been injected into the presolar cloud or solar nebula by a supernova or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star shock wave. However, this injection was likely spatially heterogeneous, potentially reducing the usefulness of Al-26 as a spatially homogeneous chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation. Previous models have shown that initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGUI) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles. Other elements and their isotopes suggest a similarly well-mixed solar nebula, but stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous during the early phases of planet formation. The leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, where self-shielding could lead to isotopic fractionation between gas-phase and solid-phase oxygen atoms. MGUI disks offer a means to accomplish large-scale outward transport of refractory particles from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula. The authors present new MGUI disk models that examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula, by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection process, for a variety of disk and central protostar masses, including protostars with M dwarf masses. The numerical models were computed with a three-dimensional, gravitational hydrodynamics code, and the results show that MGUI disk phases can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains, regardless of the stellar or disk mass, or the exact value of the Toomre Q stability parameter. A phase of MGUI in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains, as required to drive the protostellar mass accretion associated with FU Orionis events, as well as to explain the discovery of refractory grains in comet 81P/Wild 2.

This formulation uses the antisymmetry of the product between differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra. To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, which ideally should have the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, but defining such a scheme has proven challenging, particularly with regards to the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms. Adams proposed a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space using two parallel lattices to maintain locality of the Hodge star and a finite element scheme to capture the properties of the wedge product. This proposal has been thoroughly studied, but here the authors want to focus on its application to the Dirac-K\u00e4hler formulation. In lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, the staggered fermion formulation is commonly used to describe fermions, addressing the problem of fermion doubling. The continuous Dirac-K\u00e4hler formulation is regarded as providing the continuum limit for the staggered fermion formulation, and so a discrete Dirac-K\u00e4hler formulation with continuum properties could potentially offer great insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.

{"idx": 25, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nThe production of hadrons at large transverse momentum in hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally described in two steps: a hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton into a detected hadron. The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically. However, this mechanism has been found inadequate for producing particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions, where recombination of partons is a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved. Although fragmentation is still dominant at extremely high transverse momentum, it is desirable to have a universal description that can be applied to any transverse momentum based on the same hadronization scheme. To achieve this, the fragmentation process should be treated as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The subject matter is primarily of interest to high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons. Semi-hard shower partons initiated by a hard parton can either recombine among themselves or recombine with soft partons in the environment. In the former case, the fragmentation function is reproduced, and nothing new is achieved. In the latter case, a very new component emerges in heavy-ion collisions, one that has escaped theoretical attention thus far and should be an important hadronization process in the intermediate transverse momentum region. The main objective of this work is to quantify the properties of shower partons and illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons. The actual application of the shower parton distributions developed here to heavy-ion collisions will be considered elsewhere. The concept of shower partons is not new, but attempts to generate such partons in pQCD processes have not been successful in relating them to hadronization. The fragmentation of a parton to a hadron is not a process that can be calculated in pQCD, although the evolution of the fragmentation function is calculable. The fragmentation functions are usually parameterized by fitting the data from e+e- annihilations as well as from hadron-hadron and lepton-hadron collisions. Although the QCD processes of generating a parton shower by gluon radiation and pair creation can not be tracked by perturbative methods down to low virtuality, the shower parton distributions can be determined phenomenologically in much the same way that the", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

The burst was initially thought to be a long GRB but was later reclassified as a short GRB due to its lack of nesting conditions in its late x-ray emission. The document presents a new interpretation of GRB 090510 as a short GRB originating from a binary neutron star merger, supported by the excellent quality of the data and the recent progress in the understanding of the fireshell theory. The analysis reveals three distinct episodes in the burst: the prompt gamma-ray burst (p-GRB), the prompt emission, and the high-energy gamma-ray emission (GEV). The p-GRB is best fitted by a convolution of thermal spectra originating in a dyadotorus, indicating the presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH) or a Kerr black hole dominated by its angular momentum. The prompt emission follows the p-GRB and is used to determine the inhomogeneities in the circumburst medium. The GEV emission occurs at the end of the p-GRB emission and is initially concurrent with the prompt emission. The document suggests that the GEV emission originates from the matter accretion onto the newly-born BH, fulfilling the energy requirement and explaining the delayed onset of the GEV emission. The self-consistency of the entire procedure is verified by estimating the cosmological redshift of the source, which is close to and consistent with the spectroscopically measured value. The values of the isotropic energy and the peak energy of GRB 090510 fulfill the Muruwazha relation, further supporting the validity of the analysis. The main result of the article is that the dyadotorus manifests itself by the p-GRB emission and clearly precedes the prompt emission phase, as well as the GEV emission originating from the newly-formed BH. This contrasts with the usual assumption made in almost the totality of works relating BHs and GRBs, in which the BH precedes the GRB emission. The article concludes that the unique condition of generating a jetted GEV emission in the well-defined scenario of a newly-born BH will possibly lead to a deeper understanding of the equally jetted GEV emission observed in a variety of systems harboring a Kerr BH.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

The hydrogenation of PAH edges is an important route for H2 formation, and highly hydrogenated PAHs can act as efficient catalysts for H2 formation. In this study, the hydrogenation of coronene cations in the gas phase was investigated using mass spectrometry. The results showed that odd hydrogenation states of coronene cations predominantly populate the mass spectrum, indicating an alternating barrier-no barrier occurrence with increasing hydrogenation. This suggests that PAH cations can also exist in highly hydrogenated states in the interstellar medium and act as catalysts for H2 formation.

The behavior of QCD at finite baryon density and low temperature is central for astrophysics to understand the structure of compact stars and conditions near the core of collapsing stars (supernovae, hypernovae).

Studies on color superconducting phase in the 1980s can be found in ref. The topic of color superconductivity has stirred a lot of interest in recent years. For reviews on recent progress of color superconductivity, see ref. and ref. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars. To form bulk matter inside compact stars, the charge neutrality condition as well as @xmath0 equilibrium are required. This induces mismatch between the fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks. The system may exhibit a first order phase transition from the color superconducting phase to the normal phase when the mismatch increases. It was also found that the system can experience a spatial non-uniform loff (Larkin - Ovchinnikov - Fudde - Ferrell) state in a certain window of moderate mismatch. It is still not fully understood how the cooper pairing will be eventually destroyed by increasing mismatch in a charge neutral system. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system. If the charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally, and also if the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will be favored. It is difficult to precisely calculate the surface tension in the mixed phase, thus in the following, we would like to focus on the homogeneous phase when the charge neutrality condition is required locally.

Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying their internal dynamics, assuming virial equilibrium. However, these studies have found conflicting results, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard IMFs. Bastian et al.

The experimental length spectra and the trace formula show good agreement, with the different contributions of periodic orbits (POS) to the length spectra successfully identified. However, the peak positions in the experimental length spectrum are slightly shifted with respect to the geometrical lengths of the POS. This shift is attributed to two effects: the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and a systematic inaccuracy of the 2D approximation.

The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly measures the baryon-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, as these quantities are robustly measured in the CMB and only their ratio matters. Even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, the inferences for dark energy from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged. The acoustic peak method depends on measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination. The sound horizon depends only on the baryon-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, and is very insensitive to the cosmology. The baryon-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum, and the redshift of equality is robustly constrained by the amplitudes of the peaks through the potential envelope. The sound horizon decreases by only 5% if the redshift of equality is lowered by 0.2, and understanding the acoustic oscillations at low redshift allows for the measurement of this scale in large galaxy surveys.

It mentions the Kratky-Porod model, which describes such polymers as wormlike chains with local inextensibility and a penalty for bending energy. Recent studies have shown that the transverse distribution function of a polymer in two-dimensional space can have a bimodal shape for short polymers, indicating semiflexibility. The paper presents an exact representation of the transverse distribution function of a three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation of one end, using the matrix element of the Green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field. The calculations demonstrate that the transverse distribution function possesses a bimodal shape in the intermediate range of chain lengths. The paper also provides analytical results for short and long wormlike chains, which are in agreement with previous results obtained using different methods. The distribution function is found to be Gaussian for very short and very long chains, and it shows a tiny maximum at the origin at the onset of bimodality. The bimodal behavior of the projected distribution function is attributed to the varying sign of curvatures along the chain and the inhomogeneities of curvature fluctuations in the vicinity of the clamped end. The onset of bimodality in 3D is found to be similar to that in 2D when measured in units of the contour length. The calculations are shown to be accurate, and the results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

Thin films of CrAs and CrSb grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs (001) substrates have shown ferromagnetic behavior at temperatures in excess of 400 K and magnetic moments of 3\u03bcB per CrAs unit.

Recent research focuses on hosting MFs in exotic solid-state systems, particularly topological superconductors. Various realistic platforms, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains, have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. Observing unique Majorana signatures experimentally is still a challenge. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks. However, these peaks can also arise from other mechanisms, making it difficult to definitively prove the existence of MFs. An alternative all-optical scheme is proposed to detect MFs using a coupled hybrid quantum dot (QD)-nanomechanical resonator (NR) system with an optical pump-probe scheme. The interaction between MFs and the QD is mainly due to dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted to neglect tunneling. The QD is considered a two-level system, and once MFs appear and couple to the QD, the Majorana signature will be carried out via the coherent optical spectrum of the QD. The change in the coherent optical spectrum can serve as another potential evidence for MFs in iron chains. The vibration of the NR acting as a phonon cavity will enhance the exciton resonance spectrum and make MFs more sensitive to detection.

FBS can be divided into two subclasses, pnictides and chalcogenides, with iron as the basic element and square lattice distortions in lightly doped materials. The Fermi surface (FS) consists of two hole sheets around the \u0393 point and two electron sheets around the X and Y points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone, with nesting between these two groups leading to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetries and structures, with the random-phase approximation spin fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach giving an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets, while orbital fluctuations promote a sign-preserving d-wave symmetry. Probing the gap structure can help elucidate the underlying mechanism, and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool as it carries information about the gap structure through the measured dynamical spin susceptibility. Many reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra appearing only at or around the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q have been explained as the spin resonance due to the sign-changing gap state. However, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Andreev spectroscopy results have shown that there are at least two distinct gaps present in many FBS systems, and even three gaps in some cases, challenging the simple explanation of the spin resonance peak. The naive expectation is that the frequency of the spin resonance peak should shift to the lower gap scale, but this is not always the case. The peak in inelastic neutron scattering in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (x=0.62) at 4.5 meV cannot be the spin resonance as it is greater than 3.5 meV, the sum of the two gap sizes. Thus, the peak could be coming from the d-wave state, where it forms at frequencies above 3.5 meV due to the redistribution of spectral weight upon entering the superconducting state and a special form of scattering in the normal state. The authors study this question in detail and show that the naive expectation is wrong, and the true minimal energy scale is 3.2 meV, consistent with the maximal frequency of the observed peak in INS in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 and confirming that it is the true spin resonance evidencing the s-wave", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 5}}

Observations show that Type 1 AGN exhibit more near-infrared emission than Type 2 AGN, indicating that the torus is seen face-on in Type 1 AGN and edge-on in Type 2 AGN. This anisotropy can lead to a bias towards Type 1 AGN in infrared flux-limited samples. The wavelength dependence of this anisotropy can provide constraints on torus models. A significant contribution from the host galaxy to the infrared emission is a challenge when studying nearby AGN samples. The paper aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies. The average spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of obscured (Type 2) and unobscured (Type 1) AGN are presented, and the origin of the anisotropy is analyzed using extinction and clumpy torus models. The results are compared to previous infrared anisotropy estimates in the literature. The sample comprises 3CRR radio galaxies and quasars with a lobe-dominated sample presenting a well-matched set of radio galaxies and quasars in terms of their intrinsic luminosity.

The result is motivated by the behavior of the Laplacian perturbed by a divergence-free drift in dimensions 10. The main result asserts that the principal eigenvalue remains bounded if and only if the equation has a solution, called a first integral of the drift, such that certain conditions hold. The result is interpreted intuitively as functions satisfying the equation being constant along the flow of the vector field. The existence of nontrivial first integrals allows for flow lines that are contained in the domain, while if no such integrals exist, the flow leaves the domain with speed proportional to the drift. Adding the Laplacian to the drift, or equivalently a Brownian motion to the flow, results in a stochastic process whose trajectories gradually depart from the integral curves of the drift, but the general picture is similar. The result described enjoys many extensions and has proved useful in various applications describing the influence of a fluid flow on a diffusion. The purpose of the present paper is to verify that a similar property of the principal eigenvalue holds when the classical Laplacian is replaced by the fractional Laplacian with a drift vector field. The Sobolev norm condition on the first integrals reflects smoothing properties of the Green function of the fractional Laplacian, while is related to the flow defined by the drift. The main difficulty in the development stems from the roughness of general elements of and non-locality of the fractional Laplacian, which prevent a direct application of differential calculus.

The 1984-1986 event in Z And was characterized by two maxima in the visual magnitude, leading to ambiguous interpretations of the outburst as either double or disturbed single.

The origin of low luminosity X-ray emission in its quiescent state is unclear, but a possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar turns on. Aql X-1 has an orbital period of 19 hours and its outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay. Type I X-ray bursts and a soft X-ray spectrum with an equivalent bremsstrahlung temperature of 5.5 keV are observed during outbursts. As the source luminosity drops below 10^36 erg/s, the spectrum changes to a power law with a photon index of 2.5, extending up to energies of 20 keV. In quiescence, the source is detected at a level of 10^32 erg/s in the 0.4-2.4 keV band, with a black body temperature of 0.1 keV. An outburst from Aql X-1 in 1997 was monitored with the RossiXTE All Sky Monitor and BeppoSAX narrow field instruments. The source luminosity decreased rapidly around MJD 50512, with an exponential decay time of 17 days. The BeppoSAX spectra during the fast decay phase and quiescence can be fit with a model consisting of a black body plus a power law. The soft black body component remained nearly constant in temperature but its radius decreased by a factor of 5 from the decay phase to quiescence. The power law component hardened from a photon index of 2.5 during the decay to 1.8 in quiescence. The sharp flux decay leading to the quiescent state of Aql X-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, but with obvious differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra. The outburst evolution of low-mass X-ray transients containing neutron stars presents important differences from those containing black hole candidates, likely due to the presence of a surface and magnetosphere in neutron stars.

The well-defined thermodynamic temperature of colloidal dispersions allows them to be viewed as mesoscopic model atoms. External electric fields can induce dipolar interactions between colloidal particles, leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures. Direct microscopic observation at the single-particle level allows for detailed study of phase transitions and long-standing problems in condensed matter physics, such as freezing. A rotating ac field can produce disc-like patterns in colloidal dispersions, with thermodynamic equilibrium structures obtained due to Brownian motion. The lattice spacing within quasi-2D colloidal crystals can be controlled in situ using a coplanar rotating electric field. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field can be treated as a circularly symmetric attraction due to the time-averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field. The asymmetry between colloids and smaller molecular and ionic species must be addressed in considering the interactions between the particles. A coarse-graining scheme can be used to generate a one-component picture, where only the effective colloid-colloid interactions are considered, and the complexity of the description is vastly reduced. The equilibrium behavior of the colloids in the original multi-component system can then be faithfully reproduced by appeal to liquid state theory and computer simulation. In this study, a simple numerical treatment is used to predict the lattice spacing in the quasi-2D crystal from the electric field strength. The minimum in the effective interaction potential is a useful means to approximate the lattice parameter, although close to melting, fluctuations lead to a larger value in the lattice parameter than this minimum. Conversely, at high field strengths, the treatment appears to be less accurate, with higher-order terms becoming important. The minimum in the effective interaction can sometimes provide a more accurate value of the lattice parameter than the simulations at high field strengths. The debye length determined seems rather constant across the four particle sizes considered, suggesting that the approach is at least consistent. Tunable 2D crystal rafts can behave as tunable diffraction gratings capable of filtering white light into visible colors. The range of colors obtainable for a given geometry is governed by the lattice tunability, which is maximized for particles of approximately 1 to 1.5 microns. Higher field strengths applied to smaller particles can increase the lattice tunability, but are not practical in the current experimental system.

The networks are viewed as two-dimensional systems of conducting one-dimensional rods, with either metallic or semiconducting behavior. The resistance of nanotube-nanotube junctions is much larger than that of the nanotubes themselves, leading to randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport. The study finds that the onset frequency, extracted from frequency dependence measurements, increases with film thickness, while the length scale, extracted from electric field dependent measurements, decreases with thickness. An empirical relation is developed between the two transport measurement methods. SWCNT networks on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate are prepared by the spraying method, with network density controlled by solution concentration and spraying time. The thicknesses of the films range from submonolayer to 200 nm, corresponding to room temperature sheet conductance ranging from 0.01 to 100 S/square. The Corbino reflectometry setup is used to investigate the conductivity of the SWCNT networks, covering a frequency range of five and a half decades. The real parts of the conductance keep their dc value up to a characteristic frequency and start to increase at higher frequency, fitting well to the extended pair approximation model. The onset frequency increases linearly with the dc sheet conductance, with a universal relationship observed between onset frequency and dc conductance. The scaling behavior of the conductance and frequency is investigated, with all data sets falling on the same master curve. A characteristic length scale, the correlation length, is defined as the distance between connections in the sample, and is estimated using the onset frequency. The electric field dependent conductance is measured to investigate the nonlinear transport properties, with the length scale decreasing with increasing sample thickness. An empirical relation is proposed between the onset frequency and the length scale, with the parameter depending on the diffusion properties of carriers in the SWCNT films. The study concludes that the poor interbundle junctions affect the transport behavior of carriers in the SWCNT films, causing strong thickness dependence of characteristic length scales.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

A new X-ray transient source, IGR J17091-3624, also believed to be a BHB, has generated interest recently due to its repeated outbursts and similarities with GRS 1915+105. During its 2011 outburst, IGR J17091-3624 revealed a highly variable nature, displaying variability patterns similar to those seen in GRS 1915+105, including the 'heartbeat' pattern. The source also exhibited a high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) with a frequency of 66 Hz, almost identical to that in GRS 1915+105. Despite these similarities, the most perplexing difference between the two sources lies in their observed intensities, with IGR J17091-3624 being about 20 times fainter than GRS 1915+105. The apparent faintness of IGR J17091-3624 is difficult to explain even with the most favorable assumptions about its mass and distance. To investigate this, the authors performed simultaneous spectral fitting at different phases of the 'heartbeat' oscillations, using data from RXTE and XMM-Newton. This analysis suggests that the faintness of IGR J17091-3624 is likely due to its low or negative spin, in contrast to GRS 1915+105, which is known to have a high spin. The authors also found that IGR J17091-3624 is likely a high-inclination binary, consistent with previous findings. The 66 Hz HFQPO in IGR J17091-3624 may not be directly related to the black hole mass, but rather to the accretion process.

{"idx": 144, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nThe effects of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structures have been detected in several samples of high-redshift QSOs, intermediate-redshift galaxies, and BATSE GRBs. In the case of point sources like QSOs and GRBs, weak lensing manifests as angular (anti-)correlations between these sources and foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass. For galaxies, weak lensing is detected through its coherent shear effect. There is another, more direct way of detecting weak lensing, which uses fluxes of standard candles. If the observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen: brighter sources will lie behind regions of mass density excess, while fainter ones will have mass deficits in their foregrounds. The best example of cosmological standard candles, supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia), have been extensively observed with the purpose of determining the global geometry of the universe. Nuisance effects like evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied theoretically and observationally, and have either been corrected for or shown to be small. Weak lensing, another nuisance effect, has been addressed theoretically by several authors and found to be unimportant given the current uncertainties. For example, one study used ray tracing through cosmological simulations and found that the lensing-induced dispersions on truly standard candles are 0.03 and 0.04 mag at redshifts 0.5 and 0.6, respectively, in a COBE-normalized cold dark matter universe with certain parameters. These are small variations compared to the current errors, which are 0.11 mag. Even though weak lensing effects are estimated to be small for the current sample of SNe Ia, they are predicted to be non-negligible for higher redshift sources. Therefore, several authors have examined the effects of weak lensing due to galaxies along the line of sight for the highest redshift SNe Ia, such as SN1997ff at redshift 0.48.

{"idx": 145, "result": 0, "generated": "The lanthanide based heavy fermion (HF) metals are a major class of correlated electron materials with distinct behavior from conventional clean metals. Their behavior is driven by strong spin-flip scattering from essentially localized f-levels, generating a large effective mass and attendant low-energy scale indicative of strong interactions. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened f-spins. Physical properties of HFs are typically anomalous, with a resistivity showing strong non-monotonic temperature dependence and optics often exhibiting rich structure from the microwave to the near-infrared. Theoretical treatments of HFs center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) and its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model. The absence of exact results has spurred the search for suitable approximation schemes, with one such framework being dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The self-energy within DMFT becomes momentum-independent and spatially local, mapping the problem onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host. However, obtaining an approximate self-energy that handles non-perturbatively the full range of interaction strengths and respects the asymptotic dictates of Fermi liquid behavior on the lowest energy and/or temperature scales is a challenging problem. The local moment approach (LMA) is a method that satisfies these desiderata and is currently the only theory known to do so. It is based on an underlying two-self-energy description and introduces the physically intuitive notion of local moments from the outset. The LMA has been employed to study the PAM and its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model, with recent developments extending it to handle the generic asymmetric PAM and hf metals. The paper focuses mainly on results obtained using the LMA, with minimal technical details.

However, all known topological insulators contain heavy or rare metal elements, posing constraints on the search for topological materials.

The ADAF model predicts a 'submillimetre bump' in the spectral energy distribution, while the standard disc is responsible for the 'big blue bump' in luminous AGNs. The first imaging investigations for accretion discs are promising with future very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) instruments. However, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands, indicating additional unknown emission. The authors conducted a millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs, finding that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, suggesting the presence of the ADAF.

Studies of these processes have provided insights into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains. The document also discusses the importance of disentangling the effects of intervening dust from various astronomical observations, ranging from photometry and spectroscopy of galactic stars and external galaxies to mapping small-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, which can be quantified using the normalized dust extinction law or reddening law. The ratio of total to selective extinction is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law. Using data along many different galactic sight lines, Cardelli et al. found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope R0. They devised an R0-based, one-parameter family of empirical fitting functions to characterize the observed range of extinction law shapes, which was later refined by Fitzpatrick. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with diffuse interstellar dust observed to have an average R0 value of 3.1, but significant deviations from this canonical value exist for a variety of interstellar dust clouds, which appear to be generally correlated with environment. The document discusses three methods for measuring the R0 of dust in the foreground of differentially reddened globular clusters, using three-color optical photometry, two-color optical photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission, and a blue horizontal branch (HB) width minimization approach.

This feature, known as the \"vertical extension of the red clump\" (VRC), was first identified by Cannon (1970) and later studied by Zaritsky & Lin (1997), who rejected other possible explanations and concluded that it represents a massive foreground population with about 5% of the angular surface density of the LMC itself. However, the presence of this stellar foreground population as an explanation for the LMC microlensing optical depth has been challenged on several grounds, and the Macho team found no evidence for a foreground population at 3 kpc in their extensive photometric database. Instead, they found an overdensity of stars in a composite Macho V vs. I color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that they concluded is incompatible with the hypothesis of a foreground clump population. Gould (1997) argues that any luminous foreground population must meet certain conditions, and using a semi-analytic method, Johnston (1998) analyzed the Zhao (1998) proposition and concluded that an ad hoc tidal streamer to explain the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC would cause unobserved overdensities of 10-100% in star counts elsewhere in the Magellanic plane or would require disruption precisely aligned with the LMC within the last 6 years.

The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in shaping these lines, determining the position of the marginally stable orbit and affecting the overall line shape. The Laor model, which assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used but has limitations in fitting the spin parameter. Other models like the Ky model have since been developed to relax this limitation. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin by identifying the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit. This paper aims to compare the Laor and Ky models using data from the XMM-Newton satellite and simulated data for the upcoming X- ray mission. Two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, exhibiting extremely skewed iron lines, were chosen for this purpose. The Ky model showed better results in fitting the spin parameter, with a smoother adjustment between different points in the parameter space, allowing for more reliable constraints. However, for higher quality data, the discrepancies between the two models become more apparent, with the Laor model tending to overestimate the spin value and having insufficient energy resolution.

The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data, leading to a growing interest in including 2p-2h models into neutrino event generators. The only 2p-2h model currently implemented in some neutrino event generators is the Valencia model, incorporated in GENIE. However, implementing 2p-2h models is challenging due to the high computational time required, mainly due to the large number of nested integrals involved in evaluating the inclusive hadronic tensor. To address this, a fast and efficient method called the frozen nucleon approximation has been developed, which reduces the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1. This method was first explored in a previous study but was restricted to the analysis of the 2p-2h phase space. Here, it is extended to the evaluation of the full hadronic tensor, assuming that the initial momenta of the two struck nucleons can be neglected for high enough energy and momentum transfer. The frozen nucleon approximation was found to work properly in computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators. In this work, the validity of the frozen approximation is investigated beyond the phase-space study by including the electroweak meson-exchange current (MEC) model. It is found that the presence of virtual delta excitations requires introducing a \"frozen\" delta propagator, designed by a convenient average over the fermi sea. The main advantage of the frozen approximation is that it reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 to 1, making it well-suited for computing 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux.

In complex systems, it's essential to identify the relevant degrees of freedom. In crystals, the essential degrees of freedom are electrons, ions, and the electromagnetic field, but for understanding certain properties, we work with heavy electrons, phonons, and their interactions. Similarly, in QCD, the relevant degrees of freedom at low energies are constituent quarks and mesons, not just current quarks and gluons. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is a crucial phenomenon in QCD, leading to the existence of Goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons) and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by quarks. Baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting via Goldstone boson exchange and subject to confinement. The chiral constituent quark model successfully describes the spectra of both non-strange and strange baryons. The short-range part of the chiral interaction is crucial for understanding hyperfine splittings and the short-range repulsion in the nucleon-nucleon interaction.

{"idx": 194, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nLow mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where the primary is a compact object and the secondary is a low mass star. The secondary transfers mass via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk around the compact object that gives rise to the observed X-rays. LMXBs can be divided into two groups: Z-sources and atoll sources. Z-sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have mass accretion rates that reach the Eddington limit, while atoll sources have lower accretion rates. The main physical difference between Z-sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z-source and is therefore thought to be a neutron star system with an accretion rate around the Eddington limit. It is one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known, but due to its extra-galactic nature, its X-ray flux is rather low. The optical counterpart of LMCX-2 was identified by Pakull in 1978 as a blue star. Despite being X-ray luminous and having a known optical counterpart, little is known about the system parameters of LMCX-2. The estimates for the orbital period range from 6.4 hours to 12 days. In recent years, Steeghs and Casares developed a new technique to detect a signature of the donor star in persistent LMXBs using phase-resolved spectroscopy. They detected narrow emission lines in SCO X-1, especially in the Bowen blend, that were interpreted as coming from the irradiated side of the donor star. This discovery was followed by a survey of other LMXBs that are optically bright enough to also resolve these narrow components. In this paper, the authors apply the technique of Bowen fluorescence to LMCX-2 and show that it is possible to detect a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset that they identify as the orbital period. Furthermore, similar to other X-ray binaries thus far, the Bowen region shows the presence of narrow emission lines that the authors identify as coming from the irradiated side of the companion, giving the first ever constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2. On November 21 and 22, 2004, the authors obtained a total of 77 spectra of LMCX-2 with an integration time of", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

{"idx": 192, "result": 1, "generated": "<summary>\nOver the past few years, rapidity gaps have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA and Tevatron colliders, attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, with the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state being the simplest model. At the Tevatron, a fraction of all dijet events with high transverse energies and large jet separations exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets, demonstrating the relevance of color singlet exchange effects in QCD events at high momentum transfers. A gap fraction of around one percent was predicted by Bjorken, based on a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps of about 10%. However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron do not show a decrease in the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum, casting doubt on the validity of the two-gluon exchange model. In this paper, the authors reconsider the basic ideas behind the two-gluon exchange model, demonstrate its limitations, and show that the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative. They propose a unitarized model that predicts color singlet fractions which very strongly depend on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer, and cannot be reliably calculated within perturbation theory. Within this model, non-perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters: the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift. The authors analyze the implications of this model for the formation of gaps at the Tevatron, calculating how the gap fraction between two hard jets varies with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation, and compare predicted fractions with Tevatron data.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

The liquid flows through the chambers sequentially, with a second gas introduced in each chamber to displace the first gas. The displaced gas is collected and removed from the vapor space of each chamber. The treated liquid exits the final chamber. The apparatus is designed to be compact and efficient, suitable for use on floating offshore platforms. The method involves continuously introducing a flow of liquid with a first gas into the inlet chamber, flowing it through the gasification chambers, introducing a second gas in each chamber to displace the first gas, collecting and removing the displaced gas, and finally exiting the treated liquid. The apparatus can achieve significant reductions in oxygen levels, from 6-10 ppm to 0.5-1.0 ppm in a non-limiting embodiment.

{"idx": 216, "result": 0, "generated": "<summary>\nThe present disclosure relates to a person support apparatus, such as a bed, with a mechanism for adjusting the height and orientation of a patient support frame. The apparatus includes a patient support deck and a support surface, such as a mattress, supported by the deck. The deck is supported on a deck support frame, which is provided with a mechanism for adjusting the height and orientation of the deck relative to the floor. The deck support frame is supported on leg assemblies, which are pivotally connected at their upper end to the deck support frame and have linear actuators for pivoting the leg assemblies relative to the deck support frame. The leg assemblies can be pivoted together to raise or lower the deck support frame while keeping it substantially parallel to the floor, or one of the foot or head end assemblies can be pivoted to move the deck support frame into the Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg positions. The present disclosure provides an improved mechanism for pivoting the leg assemblies relative to the deck support frame, which includes an inverted substantially U-shaped channel element having a substantially continuous upper surface, two substantially continuous side surfaces connected at their top edges to the upper surface, and a downward facing opening between the bottom edges of the two side surfaces. The first upper end portion of the leg assembly includes a guide or follower element arranged to contact and run along an inner surface of the channel element. This arrangement results in a deck support frame which is robust and stable and can accommodate the changes in geometry necessary for movement or adjustment between the horizontal, Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg positions. Some embodiments of the channel and roller mechanism change the height of a patient support deck by pivoting one or more leg assemblies relative to the under surface of the patient support frame. The opening of the channel carrying the guide elements or rollers faces the floor, which means that dirt is less likely to enter it and interfere with the mechanism. Furthermore, any dirt that enters will not be visible in normal use. The leg assembly works vertically within the channel edges, and a reduced force is therefore necessary to lift the patient support frame, especially from the low position where the leg assemblies suspend a narrow angle relative to the underside of the patient support frame. The use of rollers in an optional embodiment rather than surfaces sliding relative to each other also reduces the frictional forces which must be overcome when moving the guide element. The use of a roller rather than a sliding element means that there is no need to overcome the friction between the sliding element and the frame element relative to which it slides, thus", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

The apparatus is designed to operate in ambient temperatures above the maximum permissible material temperature, and uses internal cooling channels to reduce the metal temperature to a required level. The apparatus comprises a blade airfoil section with cooling channels running in the longitudinal direction, through which a cooling fluid flows. The cooling fluid flows along the insides of the hot-gas walls, providing a cooling effect, and then emerges to the outside through film-cooling openings. The cooling channels are separated by separating walls, which also act as deflection devices to ensure that the cooling fluid flows successively through adjacent cooling channels in alternately opposite directions. The separating walls and deflection devices are no longer cast together with the apparatus but are constructed as separate inserts, which are subsequently inserted into the apparatus and secured there. This approach avoids the disadvantages of the known apparatus, such as the difficulty to cool the transitional region from the hot-gas wall to the separating wall, thermal stresses between the separating wall and the hot-gas wall, high blade weight leading to high centrifugal-force stresses, and complex casting development. The use of inserts composed of metal or non-metal materials allows for a more flexible cooling system that can be easily adjusted by replacing the inserts. The flow deflection apparatus is preferably a blade in a gas turbine, with the cooling channels and separating walls extending essentially in the radial direction with respect to the rotation axis of the gas turbine. The inserted separating walls are connected by an integral material joint, preferably by soldering or welding, to the blade, with the joint arranged at the end of the separating walls close to the axis.

The transmitter's antennae are spaced a few feet apart and driven by RF signals with distinguishable characteristics, such as different carrier frequencies, modulation frequencies, or pulse rates. The receiver is designed to detect these distinguishable characteristics and produce an output signal only when both currents are present. The system is particularly useful when the horizontal separation between the objects is less than half their depth, as it reduces the inducement of currents from both antennae in the same object when the transmitter is properly positioned.

The converter consists of a digitally-controlled variable gain amplifier, a gain control logic element, an analog summing element, a sampling element, a predictive digital filter, an offset nuller element, a digital summing element, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a digital quadrature mixer, and two rate reduction filters. The predictive loop generates a prediction of the input signal, which is subtracted at the summer to generate a prediction error signal. The offset nulling loop estimates and removes offsets introduced by implementation imperfections. The automatic gain control (AGC) loop maintains the amplitude of the modulated carrier within the dynamic range of the predictive loop. The predictive filter is implemented using digital signal processing techniques, allowing for dynamic frequency response adjustments and word length expansion. The DAC converts the digital output of the predictive filter to an analog representation, which is subtracted from the amplified, modulated IF signal to generate the error signal. The digital quadrature mixer downconverts the output of the predictive filter to baseband I and Q components. The rate reduction filters perform filtering and sample rate reduction of the I and Q components. The implementation example shows that the Downconverting Digitizer provides more than 52 dB of dynamic range, equivalent to the performance of a dual 8-bit baseband analog-to-digital converter, and the designed AGC loop extends this dynamic range to more than 124 dB.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 5}}

Historically, banks have primarily used deposits for loans or government bonds, while mutual funds invest in securities like stocks and bonds. The importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with businesses and households increasingly relying on securities markets. The growth of mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, with some studies suggesting that mutual funds have attracted sizable amounts of money that would have otherwise been placed in deposits. However, the exact magnitude of this impact is difficult to quantify due to various factors affecting the relationship between deposits and economic activity. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds has not affected the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy, but it has shifted the intermediaries through which finance flows. Mutual funds' investments in securities have become a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending, potentially benefiting those who issue securities at the expense of those who do not. The availability of finance for residential, consumer, and business sectors could be disproportionally affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds, even when the total supply of loanable and investable funds is not affected. However, it is difficult to measure the extent to which this has occurred due to the complexity of funding channels and the lack of statistical information. The Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry Association agreed that the flow of funds into mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, but some observers dispute the magnitude of this impact. The report concludes that a reasonable estimate of the impact of mutual funds on deposits is sizable but probably less than $700 billion for the period 1990 through 1994.

The Bureau's Decennial Management Division has been given this responsibility and has established an executive steering committee for this purpose. The Bureau has identified four principal goals for the 2010 Census: increase the relevance and timeliness of census long-form data, reduce operational risk, increase the coverage and accuracy of the census, and contain costs. The Bureau has developed a three-legged stool strategy to achieve these goals, which includes an accurate address list and associated maps, a mandatory American Community Survey, and a short-form-only census. The Bureau has made progress in planning the 2010 Census, but there are still certain information gaps and weak points in the planning process that could undermine a cost-effective head count and make it more difficult to obtain the support of Congress and other stakeholders. The Bureau's life cycle cost estimates for the 2010 Census are sensitive to many key assumptions, and greater transparency could be obtained by showing the range and likelihood of how true cost drivers could differ from those assumed and how those differences would affect estimates of total cost. The Bureau has not yet determined the feasibility of refinements to the 2000 approach or alternative methodologies for measuring coverage in the 2010 Census. The Bureau's decision on how coverage evaluation data will be used in 2010 appears to be premature, as the Bureau has not yet determined the feasibility of refinements to the 2000 approach or alternative methodologies. The Bureau's three-legged stool strategy assumes that all three legs must work together to achieve its goals, and the failure of any one leg could jeopardize the Bureau's goals. The Bureau has not yet developed a contingency plan other than to revert to a \"traditional\" census if the reengineered effort fails. The Bureau's planning process could be improved by developing an operational plan that consolidates budget, methodological, and other relevant information into a single, comprehensive project plan.

JWST is intended to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth and has a 6.5-meter primary mirror, making it about 100 times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST's science instruments are designed to observe very faint infrared sources and require extremely cold temperatures to operate effectively. To keep these instruments cold, a multi-layered tennis-court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun's heat. The sunshield and primary mirror are designed to fold and stow for launch and fit within the launch vehicle. The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) and the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) are integrated is referred to as OTIS, which is not considered an element by NASA but is categorized as such for ease of discussion. JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope as well as collect and transmit data back to Earth. The project has experienced significant increases to project costs and schedule delays since its approval for development. Prior to being approved for development, cost estimates of the project ranged from $1 billion to $3.5 billion with expected launch dates ranging from 2007 to 2011. The project has made progress building, integrating, and testing significant portions of JWST in the past year within the commitments made at the time of the 2011 replan for both schedule and cost.

There are five franchise funds currently in operation, with DOD primarily using two for contracting services\u2014GovWorks, operated by the Department of the Interior, and FedSource, operated by the Department of the Treasury. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to a range of regulatory requirements and contracting practices designed to protect the government\u2019s interests. In obtaining contracting services through a franchise fund, three main parties share responsibilities for ensuring that proper procedures are followed: government customer\u2014the program office or agency in need of a good or service; franchise fund\u2014the federal entity that provides contracting services; and contractor\u2014the vendor that provides the good or service desired by the government customer. DOD program officials are most familiar with the technical requirements for the goods and services they need. DOD contracting officers can place orders directly through many interagency contracts. Alternatively, DOD pays the franchise fund to assume many of the contracting responsibilities that normally would have been handled by DOD\u2019s contracting officers if the customers had relied on them to purchase the goods or services. Whether DOD makes purchases directly or through another agency, regulatory procedures and requirements are the same, such as ensuring competition, determining fair and reasonable pricing, and monitoring contractor performance.

It was first introduced in 1969 to prevent wealthy individuals from using loopholes to avoid paying taxes, but its coverage has expanded over time due to inflation and changes in the tax code. The AMT exempts the first $45,000 for joint returns and $33,750 for single returns, with the first $175,000 taxed at 26% and the remainder at 28%. Exemptions are phased out for high-income individuals. The AMT base includes certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions, but excludes lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds. Credits are automatically included in the AMT base, except for the child credit, which was made permanently available under the AMT in 2009. The AMT has seen a significant increase in the number of taxpayers affected, from 140,000 in 1987 to 823,000 in 1999, and is projected to cover 9 million taxpayers by 2009. This expansion has been driven by the failure to index AMT exemptions to inflation, which has caused more middle-income taxpayers to be subject to the AMT.

The federal government has implemented multiple programs and policies to achieve this goal, with a framework that includes preventive efforts launched outside the country, border management as a series of concentric circles, and emergency preparedness and response. Border management is complex, with many federal agencies involved in securing the homeland that often lacked communication and adequate technology. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated many of these agencies into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security (BTS) overseeing border security. BTS houses the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). CBP is responsible for securing borders, territorial waters, terminals, waterways, and transportation systems, with the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, and ICE also playing significant roles. The U.S. northern and southwest borders extend over 6,000 miles, with vast areas lacking direct surveillance, and both borders pose vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit. The border patrol has increased manpower and uses various types of technology, such as video cameras, ground sensors, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), to provide surveillance at the border. Additionally, agencies continue to invest in technology to aid in detecting harmful things, including explosives. The U.S. government has employed strategies and programs to make borders more secure, such as pushing the border outwards to intercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the United States, hardening the border through the use of technology and the presence of more agents, making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel, strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence, and multiplying effectiveness through the engagement of other actors in the enforcement effort. Many contend that the best way to secure the border is by addressing issues before they reach the border, and efforts to push the border outwards have been emphasized since the terrorist attacks. However, critics argue that there are still gaps in the system, and current efforts to provide a layered approach to border security may not be sufficient.

The study aimed to define the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa in CD and HP-infected children and to identify unique histopathology profiles of LG. Forty patients were divided into four groups: normal controls, active CD without HP, HP-infected without CD, and active CD with HP. The study found that LG was most prevalent in CD patients with HP infection, followed by CD patients without HP. HP infection contributed to an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) positive for CD3 and CD8 in CD patients, but not in HP-infected patients without CD. The study also found that the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum might hint towards the diagnosis of CD rather than HP infection, and the number of lymphoid follicles directs towards the diagnosis of HP infection. In conclusion, the study provides new insights into the immunoprofiles of gastric inflammatory cells involved in CD and HP infection and suggests that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum could be helpful in differentiating between CD and HP infection in undefined cases.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

Mller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, play a crucial role in retinal function and are involved in multiple pathological retinal diseases such as glaucoma. In glaucoma, reactive Mller cells can aggravate retinal damage by releasing cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which contributes to neurodegeneration. A study aimed to determine if L-2-aminoadipic acid (AAA), a compound that induces specific glial toxicity, inhibits Mller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and AOH was induced by increasing the IOP to 110 mmHg for 60 minutes. AAA was injected into the vitreous humor after 3 hours of AOH induction. The study found that AOH induced retinal thinning, increased apoptosis, and decreased the number of RGCs. AAA treatment attenuated retinal thinning, reduced apoptosis, and rescued the decreased number of RGCs. Immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS) showed that AOH induced Mller cell gliosis, which was attenuated by AAA treatment. Western blot analysis revealed that AOH upregulated retinal TNF-\u03b1 levels, which were significantly attenuated by AAA treatment. The study concluded that AAA protected RGCs in the AOH model by inhibiting Mller cell gliosis and downregulating TNF-\u03b1 production, suggesting that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target for treating neurodegeneration in glaucoma.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

It consists of a pair of N-terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, and ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain. MyoVa's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms, resulting in 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion. Each lever arm consists of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains, and calcium is required to activate MyoVa's ATPase activity. In the presence of high calcium (>1 mM), motor processivity is reduced, and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm, rendering the lever arm highly compliant and potentially reducing the efficiency of both lever arm displacement amplification and strain-dependent gating between the two heads, necessary for the motor's processivity. Single MyoVa motors are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro, requiring sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search, allowing MyoVa to switch actin tracks even when the angle between intersecting actin filaments is ~150\u00b0. Here, tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains.

Aging is a significant risk factor for endothelial dysfunction, which is characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function in older adults by increasing NO bioavailability, reducing oxidative stress, and alleviating inflammation. The benefits of exercise are thought to be mediated by the upregulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms, increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and modulation of inflammatory cytokines. Regular exercise can slow down age-related losses in endothelial function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The median time to complete closure was 15 weeks. The study proposed several surrogate variables for complete healing, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT). Granulation tissue development was also considered as a potential surrogate. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals. The candidate surrogates were then codified, and their association with the final outcome (complete ulcer closure) was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PV+), negative predictive values (PV-), and the correct classification index. The product coefficient (PC) was used to quantify the contribution of the candidate surrogates to the final outcome. The study found that granulation tissue development, particularly when it covered >75% of the ulcer area at the EOT, was a strong predictor of complete healing in DFUs. The proportion mediated by granulation tissue development was very high, suggesting that it plays an essential role in the healing process. The study also found that area change-dependent candidates had a small proportion mediated, possibly due to the more exigent condition of the lesions. The models for final cicatrization and the granulation surrogates were adequate and fulfilled the original Prentice criteria for the definition of a surrogate end point. The study concluded that granulation tissue development can be used as a surrogate for complete healing in advanced DFUs and has practical value for treatment algorithm decisions and/or pharmacoeconomic considerations.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

Some studies suggest that plasma vaspin concentrations are higher in men with metabolic syndrome and in type 2 diabetes patients compared to those without. However, a study by Inoue et al. found that serum vaspin levels were negatively correlated with creatinine levels and were reduced in Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. The study aimed to investigate whether serum vaspin levels are elevated or reduced in diabetic patients with renal insufficiency.\nA total of 416 subjects were divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of renal insufficiency (RI) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Renal function was assessed using the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) derived from the Cockroft-Gault formula. The serum vaspin levels showed no significant differences between non-T2DM patients with RI and without RI, or between diabetic patients with RI and without RI. However, the serum vaspin was lower in patients with T2DM than in individuals without T2DM. The serum adiponectin level was higher in non-diabetic individuals with RI compared to those without RI, but did not differ between diabetic patients with RI and without RI. Regardless of T2DM status, the serum adiponectin level was significantly higher in individuals with RI than in those without RI.\nSpearman's analysis showed that serum vaspin levels were related to creatinine in non-diabetic patients, and to age, systolic blood pressure, and uric acid in diabetic patients. In all subjects, serum vaspin levels were related to CrCl, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the level of hemoglobin A1c was independently and significantly associated with the vaspin concentration in all subjects. The level of CrCl was independently and significantly associated with the adiponectin concentration in all subjects. However, no significant correlations between serum vaspin or adiponectin levels and any parameter were detected in both groups of subjects with T2DM and without T2DM after adjustment for age and BMI.\nAdipose tissue is a highly active endocrine organ secreting a number of bioactive molecules called adipokines, such as vaspin and adiponectin.

However, the number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of lymph nodes removed and examined, making it challenging to assess axillary lymph node status reliably. The lymph node ratio (LNR), the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes to removed lymph nodes, provides more useful prognostic information than the number of metastatic lymph nodes alone. In a study of breast carcinoma patients with 1-3 axillary metastatic lymph nodes, the most significant LNR threshold value separating patients into low- and high-risk groups was 0.20 for disease-free survival (DFS), 0.30 for locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and 0.15 for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).

Virchow proposed that cancer arises from chronic inflammation, while Correa developed a model for gastric cancer progression, initially attributing it to environmental factors. Warren and Barry Marshall discovered H. pylori's role in gastritis and peptic ulcers, and subsequent studies confirmed its link to gastric cancer. H. pylori infection increases the risk of non-cardia gastric cancer, with CagA-positive strains posing a greater risk. Eradication of H. pylori can reduce gastric cancer risk, with promising results from population-based studies. However, there are concerns about its potential protective role against esophageal adenocarcinoma and the consequences of widespread antibiotic use. Current research focuses on identifying co-factors that promote gastric cancer after H. pylori colonization, with the goal of creating personalized prevention strategies.

It is classically diagnosed by the presence of proteinuria in women with gestational hypertension, but recent studies suggest that proteinuria is not a significant predictor of adverse outcomes. Hypoalbuminemia, a condition where albumin levels are low, has been hypothesized to serve as an indicator of severe PE. This study aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with PE according to different albumin levels (25 g/L and <25 g/L). A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 299 women with singleton pregnancies between January 2014 and June 2015. The results showed that severe hypoproteinemia (SHp) was a significant risk factor for cesarean section (CS), poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE women. Women with SHp were more likely to have severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta. Neonates of women with SHp were more likely to have fetal growth restriction (FGR), neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm deliveries. The study suggests that SHp is a risk factor for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in PE and deserves closer surveillance during pregnancy.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

The first completely sequenced genomes were annotated using homology-based methods, but this approach has limitations. Domain architectures of proteins can provide clues about their functions, and resources like Pfam, Smart, and InterPro help identify domains. However, domain-based annotation doesn't predict cellular function or phenotypic effects.

Aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, and is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for preventing heart attack and ischemic stroke. The study aimed to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention in a nationally representative sample using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012. The study found that less than a third of patients eligible for aspirin as primary prevention reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and over three-fourths of primary prevention patients were classified as low risk. Among high-risk patients, fewer than half received a recommendation to take aspirin, while over one-fourth of low-risk patients were also recommended to take aspirin. The study also found that objective risk level was not associated with an increased risk of recommendation for aspirin in a multivariate analysis, suggesting that decisions for treatment recommendations may be made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CHD risk. Additionally, the study found that patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, or concomitant use of clopidogrel or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have contributed to the lack of recommendations for aspirin use to high-risk patients. The study highlights the need for improved clinical decision support to accurately compute risk and make appropriate treatment recommendations, as well as addressing access to care and racial/ethnic disparities in primary prevention.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

Endogenous glucocorticoids play a critical role in this response, as blocking their production or action abolishes the bone marrow response to challenge. In mice, dexamethasone increases eosinophil production and primes bone marrow cells for increased IL-5 responses, but this effect is absent in perforin-deficient mice. Perforin deficiency also results in reduced granulocyte numbers in bone marrow and blood, and a selective defect in granulopoiesis that can be corrected by wild-type lymphocyte transfer. The transferred lymphocytes likely provide a missing component, possibly perforin, and may act by homing to the recipient's bone marrow and interacting with granulocyte progenitors/precursors.

The most prominent EET isomer, 14,15-EET, and other members of this autacoid family are produced via metabolism of arachidonic acid by cytochromes P450, particularly members of the 2c and 2j families. The ratio of EET isomers and their stereocomposition are isoform-dependent and species- and tissue-specific. Numerous chemical and metabolic factors complicate investigations into the roles of 14,15-EET and its potential therapeutic utility. Its susceptibility to aerial oxidation or auto-oxidation necessitates handling and storage under strict conditions to minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals. A precis of inactivating enzymatic processes includes esterification, metabolism by other pathways of the arachidonate cascade, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a major determinant in maintaining the steady state levels of 14,15-EET, whose half-life has been estimated at no more than seconds to minutes. Inhibition of sEH can elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes. However, this strategy might prove less efficacious than an agonist replacement therapy whenever endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised, for instance, as a consequence of disease, inflammation, radiotherapy, aging, and/or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs that inhibit cytochromes P450. To address some of the stability limitations of natural EETs, the laboratories previously prepared several iterations of EET surrogates with improved stability. Advanced versions were evaluated for relaxation of precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and for in vitro inhibition of recombinant human sEH. Depending upon the bioisostere and its position along the carbon chain, varying levels of vascular relaxation and/or sEH inhibition were observed.

TADs, ranging from 100 kb to 1 Mb in size, are stable units that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions. The boundaries of TADs serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions, with strong boundaries limiting interactions between adjacent TADs.

RNA interference (RNAi) has become widely recognized as an important gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of mRNAs. Acting through this mechanism, double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can knock down expression levels via the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of the targeted mRNAs. In fission yeast, homologs of the RISC can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNAs, a mechanism also seen in plants, ciliates, nematodes, and flies. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have also been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing. In human cells, it has recently been reported that short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAa), which has been shown to be conserved in other mammalian species, including mouse, rat, and nonhuman primates. Promoter-targeted small hairpin RNAs have also been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo. While the mechanism is not completely understood, it appears that naturally occurring antisense transcripts arising from or near the same genetic locus are able to direct recruitment of argonaute proteins and histone methyltransferases. Short-activating RNAs (saRNAs) may regulate transcription by targeting these antisense transcripts for degradation, resulting in a reversal of this epigenetic silencing and upregulation of sense mRNA. Based on this approach, a method to design saRNAs for upregulation of specific cellular genes has been developed. In the present study, the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming were focused on. Combined expression of the transcription factors KLF4, POU5F1 (also called OCT3/4), SOX2, and C-MYC has been shown to reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

The nature of the assemblies that exhibit the highest toxicity and seeding capacity is debated, with fibrillar assemblies being the most toxic and capable of recruiting the soluble form of homologous proteins. The toxicity of these assemblies is due in part to their binding to and permeabilization of the cell membrane, leading to cell apoptosis and the leakage of lysosomal content. The existence of strains of proteins like alpha-synuclein and tau, which can adopt different conformations and exhibit distinct properties, has been established, contributing to the diversity of neurodegenerative diseases.
