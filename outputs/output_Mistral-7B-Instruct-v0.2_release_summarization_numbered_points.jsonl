The text discusses the results of observations and simulations of six extrasolar planetary systems, all of which have planets with high eccentricities.\n2. The authors used the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) to obtain high-precision radial velocity measurements and perform test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in each system.\n3. The simulations showed that there are regions where additional objects can exist, and protected resonances are present in some systems. Combining the simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision HET data and all available published data can rule out additional short-period planets down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions.\n4. The authors found that the three systems with the best limits (HD 3651, HD 45350, and HD 16 Cyg b) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions. They also showed that additional factors such as a paucity of data, short time baselines, and large intrinsic scatter made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in the study.\n5. The authors concluded that for the six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems studied, there is no evidence for additional planets.

The transport properties of chaotic deterministic ratchets are not well-understood, particularly in relation to ratchet systems with asymmetric periodic potentials and directed particle transport.\n2. Recent interest in these systems stems from considerations of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as observed in biological systems.\n3. Chaotic systems, whether deterministic or not, have complex phase-space structures consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or co-existing attractors, which can change significantly with parameter variations.\n4. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the ensemble average velocity could be positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.\n5. He conjectured a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics.\n6. Barbi and Salerno argued against this conjecture, showing that current reversals could occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative explanation related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.\n7. The current in chaotic deterministic ratchets depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and the number of trajectories considered.\n8. The current is less likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or the spread of initial conditions in the chaotic regime, but a larger ensemble is required to ensure convergence.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 8}}

The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point.\n2. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors include the lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.\n3. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.\n4. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum (AM) reach a minimum period at around 65 minutes. The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region.\n5. The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which in turn is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer and thermal relaxation. The minimum period occurs where the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time are about equal.\n6. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to \"hide\" the spike by introducing a spread of period minimum values in the CV population.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6}}

A visionary idea for using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode binary information for spintronic logic gates was first proposed, but the identity of the originator remains uncertain.\n2. Feynman is rumored to have suggested this concept casually around 1985, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates did not exist until the mid-1990s.\n3. Encoding information in spin offers potential advantages, such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.\n4. In 1994, a concrete scheme was proposed for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field.\n5. Exchange interaction between neighboring spins favors anti-ferromagnetic ordering, or the singlet state, over ferromagnetic ordering, or the triplet state.\n6. The ground state of the array has a spin configuration that encodes logic 1 in the upspin state and logic 0 in the downspin state.\n7. The system can get stuck in a long-lived metastable state (Fig. 1(b)) due to the weak magnetic field, which can prevent decay to the global ground state (Fig. 1(a)).\n8. In 1996, a more elegant solution was proposed to propagate the input state through a linear array by lowering two adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time.\n9.

Quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical descriptions, with degrees of non-classicality ranging from non-separable (entangled) states to Bell-nonlocal states.\n2. Non-separable states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of their constituents, and their measurement correlations cannot be explained by a local hidden state (LHS) model.\n3. Bell-nonlocal states violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality and allowing two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if either of them or their detectors cannot be trusted.\n4. EPR-steerability is a weaker form of non-classical correlation than Bell-nonlocality, allowing a demonstration of EPR-steering if one party's measurements cannot be explained by a hybrid LHS model.\n5. The quantum steering ellipsoid formalism is used to investigate the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed reduced states, specifically the class of t-states.\n6. A deterministic LHS model is developed for projective measurements on t-states using the steering ellipsoid formalism, and two sufficient conditions for t-states to be EPR-steerable are derived via EPR-steering inequalities.\n7.

Yurtsever showed that the CH formed in spacetimes of CPW is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and CX revealed an analogous result through linear perturbation analysis.\n4. The electromagnetic field itself plays a role in weakening the strength of a singularity in CPW, and the collision of pure EM waves has a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned.\n5. Bell and Szekeres gave a solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, and the singularity (a CH) formed in the interaction region of their solution was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation, but it possesses essential curvature singularities on the null boundaries.\n6. Cross polarization and the EM field both play roles in the nature of the resulting singularity, so a cross polarized version of the Bell-Szekeres (CPBS) solution was pursued.\n7. The CPBS solution was found to have the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region, but cross polarization does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries.\n8.

Within the framework of general relativity, the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy.

Entanglement sudden death (ESD) is a phenomenon where qubit entanglement terminates due to Markovian decoherence, but it is not always the final fate.\n4. Revived entanglement after ESD has been observed in optical systems and plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.\n5. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD is always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.\n6. The entanglement distribution among subsystems depends on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.\n7. The double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model shows that entanglement is transferred periodically among all bipartite partitions, and an identity about the entanglement in the whole system is satisfied at any time.\n8.

Integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with small scales generates effective interactions among the large particles, which are inherently not pairwise additive.\n6. The paper assesses the quantitative influence of many-body effects on critical casimir forces (CCFs), which arise due to the confinement of order parameter fluctuations in a critical fluid.\n7. The study adds one sphere to the sphere-wall configuration to investigate many-body forces and uses field-theoretic mean field theory (MFT) to compute the forces between individual pairs and the three-body forces on the same footing.\n8. The results show that many-body critical casimir forces are attractive for all three cases considered and that the systems in this study behave similarly to the system studied in ref.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and plays an important role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM).\n2. H2 formation is governed by the sticking of H atoms onto dust grains, which can occur in both physisorbed and chemisorbed states.\n3. Dust grains in the ISM are mainly carbonaceous or silicate particles, with a large part of the available surface area in the form of very small grains or PAHs.\n4. PAHs have characteristics similar to graphite surfaces and are efficient catalysts for H2 formation through hydrogenation on their edges.\n5. Neutral PAHs are highly hydrogenated and efficient catalysts for H2 formation, as confirmed by recent experiments and calculations.\n6. PAH cations, which are usually present at lower extinction levels, also represent an important route to form H2 through the addition of the first hydrogen atom, which is barrierless.\n7. The further hydrogenation of PAH cations is associated with a barrier if the number of already attached hydrogen atoms is odd, and no barrier if this number is even.\n8. The results from the experiment on the hydrogenation of coronene cations in the gas phase support the presence of a barrier-no barrier alternation for the hydrogenation of PAH cations.\n9.

The cosmological constant problem (CCP) in particle physics refers to the puzzle of explaining the observed vacuum energy density, which is much smaller than theoretical predictions. The problem consists of several pieces, including the existence of various sources of vacuum energy density, the large radiative corrections, and the experimental value of the cosmological constant.\n2. In the framework of effective field theory, it is suggested that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy, under the assumption that the classical gravitational fields do not effectively couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy. This conjecture is based on the assumption that external gravitons can couple to gravitational corrections involving internal gravitons.\n3. The evolution of dark energy is studied, and it is found that the effective potential including contributions of graviton at one-loop level is much less than the vacuum energy density if the latter is much less than the Planck scale. The zero point energy density given by the graviton loop varies logarithmically on the renormalization point and is identified with the dark energy density.

For red galaxies, clustering is a non-monotonic function of luminosity, peaking at both high and low luminosities.\n3. The investigations also show that galaxy environment is independent of surface brightness and concentration at fixed color and luminosity, indicating that color and luminosity measures of star formation history have a more fundamental relationship with environment.\n4.

Significant progress has been made in understanding condensed phase dynamics using prototypical models like the Caldeira-Leggett and spin-boson models.\n3. Bosonic bath models, which assume that knowing the linear response of an environment near equilibrium is sufficient to predict dissipative quantum dynamics, have been prevalently adopted.\n4. However, more physical and chemical studies suggest the essential roles of other bath models, such as fermionic bath models and anharmonic environments.\n5. The text briefly summarizes three scenarios where standard bosonic bath models fail to predict the correct electron transfer rate in donor-acceptor complexes strongly coupled to intramolecular modes.\n6. Solutions include using a bath of non-interacting Morse or quartic oscillators or mapping anharmonic environments onto effective harmonic modes with a temperature-dependent spectral density.\n7. The text also introduces the stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation, which extends to all three fundamental bath models: non-interacting bosons, fermions, and spins.\n8. The stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) prescribes a simple yet general form of quantum dissipative dynamics when bath effects are modeled as colored noises.\n9. The text derives numerical schemes to deterministically simulate quantum dynamics for all three fundamental bath models by formally averaging out the noise variables.\n10.

The plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes that have nodes on both the walls can exist. The zero-point energy (per unit area) when the plates are kept at close distance is smaller than when the plates are at infinite separation.\n4.

The force between two plates made out of the same material always attracts, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium. For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.\n6.

Current patching systems and reputation models can mitigate these threats.\n3. Active p2p worms can utilize the p2p overlay to accurately find vulnerable hosts and infect them, or release worms in a hit list of p2p hosts to bootstrap the infection.\n4. The p2p overlay provides an accurate way for worms to find more vulnerable hosts without probing randomly selected IP addresses, and the worm attack traffic can easily blend into normal p2p traffic.\n5.

This velocity is affected by the pressure of the accelerated particles and the diffusion coefficient, which is momentum-dependent.\n3.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding nonlinear shock reacceleration in astrophysical environments where seed particles are non-negligible, such as in supernova remnants.

In contrast, the time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol and multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol combine certain phases into one, allowing for more efficient use of the wireless medium.\n3. The achievable rates of most existing protocols for two-hop relay transmission are limited by the instantaneous capacity of the weakest link associated with the relay due to the fixed schedule of using transmission modes and lack of exploitation of instantaneous channel state information (CSI).\n4.

Dark matter is non-baryonic and makes up 23% of the total mass-energy. Its nature is unknown.\n3. Dark energy is a mysterious form of energy that was first identified through observations of the Hubble diagram of supernovae of type Ia. Its origin is also unknown and may be related to a constant cosmological term.\n4. The distribution of matter in the universe is explained by the presence of dark matter, which interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter and causes the observed large-scale structures.\n5. Dark matter is thought to be non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation and is often referred to as cold dark matter (CDM). The leading candidate for the particle that makes up dark matter is the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP).\n6. The observed rotation curves of galaxies cannot be explained by the visible matter alone. The presence of a large amount of dark matter is required to explain the observed flat rotation curves.\n7. The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a theory that modifies Newton's law of gravity in the low-acceleration regime to explain the observed rotation curves of galaxies without invoking dark matter.\n8.

The complex virial theorem and graphical methods can be used to pick the best numerical solution of a given problem, which corresponds to the stabilized points in the trajectories. Other methods to calculate the energy and lifetime of the resonance also have to deal with the problem of which solutions (complex eigenvalues) are physically acceptable.\n3. The density of states (dos) method allows obtaining the energy and lifetime of the resonance in a simple way, both quantities being obtained as least square fitting parameters.

In the absence of interactions, if the impurity distribution is completely random, all states are exponentially localized in dimensions one (1d) and two (2d), while a mobility edge exists in dimensions three (3d).\n2. If the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum. This was demonstrated in 1d for the random dimer model (RDM) and the dual random dimer model (DRDM). In 1d, the effects of correlated disorder were studied in various physical contexts. In 2d, the effect of correlations is almost unexplored, except for the case of a speckle potential and for pseudo-2d random dimer lattices with separable dimensions.\n3. The 2d extension of the RDM was studied to analyze its localization properties. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) was considered, and it was observed that the states around the resonance energy are delocalized. The effective Hamiltonian for the unperturbed and perturbed cases was schematically illustrated.\n4. The system was then considered for a weakly interacting bose gas confined on the 2d square lattice with the 2d-DRDM potential. The ground state wavefunction was found using a Gutzwiller approach, and it was shown that the disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, and enhances both in correspondence of the resonance energy of the 2d-DRDM single-particle Hamiltonian.\n5. The dependence of such quantities on the interaction strength was explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion.

The origin of the latter is still debated, but FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, with iron as the basic element.\n2. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe 3d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the M point and two electron sheets around the X and Y points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ). In the two-fe BZ, electron pockets are centered at the \u0393 point.\n3. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, with maximal scattering near the wave vector equal to M or X in the 1-fe BZ or to \u0393 in the 2-fe BZ. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetries and structures.\n4. The random-phase approximation spin fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach gives the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets (d-wave state) as the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations. Orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving symmetry.\n5. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure and elucidating the underlying mechanism. There have been reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems appearing only for Tc or around Tc. The common explanation is that the peak is the spin resonance appearing due to the d-wave state, but recent ARPES and Andreev spectroscopy results suggest the presence of at least two distinct gaps in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LFeAs. The larger gap is about 9 meV and the smaller gap is about 4 meV in BaCo2As2 materials.

Mu can be an untrusted and completely controlled eavesdropper.\n3. MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and is remarkable because it removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard QKD.\n4. The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is almost perfect and carefully characterized.\n5. The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit since the characterization of the detection unit involves the estimation of the response of the devices to unknown input signals sent from Eve.\n6. Two schemes of phase encoding MDIQKD have been proposed, and their security has been proven with basis-dependent flaw. The first scheme employs phase locking of two separate laser sources, while the second one uses the conversion of phase encoding into polarization encoding.\n7. The simulation results imply that the first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy of the state preparation, while the second scheme can cover much longer distances when the state is prepared very precisely.\n8.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by no hydrogen but strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness, making them brighter than most other SNe and exhibiting uniform light curves. They are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies.\n2. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion scenario for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion, increases its mass, and then explodes. Significant progress has been made in this model, particularly in sustaining stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.\n3. There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. The accreting WD model predicts which companion stars lead to SNe Ia.\n4. Observations have not yet confirmed the above evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia, requiring the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site.\n5. A possible method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta is by observing broad blue wings in the absorption lines of the companion star. This was demonstrated by the absence of such features in the spectrum of a star discovered near SNR 1006.\n6. The companion star of Tycho's SNR was proposed to be identified using this method, as the star exhibits absorption lines with broad blue wings in its spectrum. However, uncertainties in the explosion model and the presence of other stars inside the ejecta make the identification challenging.\n7. The number of Fe I ions in the freely expanding ejecta is sensitive to the number of ionizing photons emitted from the shocked ejecta.

Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) between Alice and Bob has achieved significant improvements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, but security loopholes remain due to the manipulation domain of the local oscillator (LO), an auxiliary light beam used for balanced homodyne detection.\n2. In practical systems, the LO intensity is monitored by splitting a small part with a beam splitter, and pulses with large LO intensity fluctuations are discarded. However, even with monitoring, the effect of LO intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate is not yet fully understood.\n3. A new attacking scheme, called a LO intensity attack (LOIA), exploits the LO intensity fluctuations to reduce channel excess noise and obtain partial or full secret keys without being detected.\n4. The security of practical CVQKD implementation under LOIA was analyzed, and it was found that the secret key rate decreases rapidly over long distances or small channel transmissions when Eve attacks the LO intensity during key distribution.\n5. Eve could obtain partial or full secret keys by controlling the different transmissions of LO, even with a small LO intensity fluctuation or attenuating rate.\n6. To mitigate the risk of LOIA, it is essential to monitor the LO intensity carefully and scale measurements with instantaneous intensity values of LO, or scale with the lowest intensity value if the fluctuations are very small, but this will estimate the secret key rate pessimistically.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6}}

These features were first discovered in the Milky Way and have since been observed in several other spiral galaxies.\n2. The text describes two main classes of explanations for the formation of HI supershells: internal sources, such as starbursts, and external sources, such as infall of massive gas clouds. The internal source model involves starbursts, stellar winds, and subsequent supernova explosions. The external source model, also known as the chimney model, suggests that the HI supershells are produced by processes related to underlying star formation.\n3. The text presents evidence in favor of the chimney model, including the association between extraplanar HI filaments and star forming regions in the disk of NGC 891 and other correlations between halo emission and in-disk tracers of star formation. It also argues that the presence of HI supershells is expected to correlate with the existence of other halo gas, supporting the idea that stellar winds and supernovae are responsible for the HI supershells.\n4. The text discusses the difficulties with the starburst model for HI supershells, particularly the required input energies for the largest shells, which often require energy input from staggering numbers of spatially correlated supernova events. It also presents evidence against the star formation processes creating the HI shells, such as the lack of optical evidence for recent star formation in numerous lower energy HI holes and the absence of X-ray and FUV emission.\n5.

This analysis was carried out using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and complemented by considering data from the HST archive on a second white dwarf, Procyon b.

The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds.\n3. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity far below its mean. The atomic-to-molecular transition occurs in photodissociation regions (PDRs), and the structure and chemistry of these regions have been extensively studied.\n4.

It is important to disentangle the effects of intervening dust from various astronomical observations, including photometry and spectroscopy of galactic stars and external galaxies, and mapping small-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n4. The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law (or reddening law), where extinction is the sum of absorption plus scattering.\n5. The ratio of total to selective extinction, Rv, is a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.\n6. Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989) found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope Rv.\n7. Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with diffuse interstellar dust having an average Rv of 3.1, but significant deviations from this value and corresponding differences in the overall shape of the extinction/reddening law exist for various interstellar dust clouds.\n8.

The Kondo lattice model (KLM) is a model of a lattice system of localized magnetic moments coupled to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons. The model is characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, including the Kondo scale, the coherence temperature, and the RKKY interaction energy scale.\n2. The KLM is solved using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the Kondo effect but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size. The DCA is implemented using the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method with delayed updates to enhance performance.\n3. The KLM is found to exhibit a magnetic order-disorder transition between insulating states, which is assumed to belong to the three-dimensional universality class. However, due to the small cluster sizes considered in the DCA, the physics of this transition cannot be captured.\n4. Within the magnetically ordered phase, the single-particle spectral function is found to compare well with the exact lattice QMC results, indicating that the DCA is a well-suited approximation for use with the KLM.\n5.

Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto super-massive black holes.\n2. The accretion is often explained by the model of an optically-thin disc, such as an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), rather than an optically-thick disc. The ADAF model predicts a \"submillimetre bump\" in its spectral-energy distribution (SED), while the standard disc is responsible for a big-blue bump in the SED of luminous AGNs.\n3. The first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments that will provide micro-arcsec resolutions. The observational evidence of the ADAF is crucial in the LLAGN radio sources.\n4. Although the ADAF model successfully explains the broadband spectra of LLAGNs, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands. This indicates that additional unknown emission exists and may be buried under it.\n5. Millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs were reported in the present paper. A high-frequency observation is very promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF because of its advantages in being less affected by non-thermal jets and predicting larger flux densities at higher frequencies.\n6.

Broad emission iron lines are features found in the spectra of about two dozen active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, believed to originate close to the black hole from the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc.\n2. The spin of the black hole plays an important role in determining the position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc. The innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value.\n3. The LAOR model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used for over two decades to model relativistic disc spectral lines. However, it sets the dimensionless angular momentum to a canonical value, limiting its use in data fitting.\n4. Recent models have relaxed this limitation and allowed the angular momentum to be fitted, enabling more accurate modeling of the broad iron line. Other numerical codes have also been developed independently with similar functionality.\n5. The aim of the study is to compare the LAOR and other relativistic line models using the current XMM-Newton data and artificial data for the upcoming X-ray mission. Two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit an extremely skewed iron line, have been chosen for analysis.\n6.

Both sources are well described by a continuum model plus a broad iron line model.\n7. The study compares the modeling of the broad iron line by the LAOR and other relativistic models and finds that the other model leads to a better defined minimum for the best fit value and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots.

The Zero Range Potential (ZRP) approach was developed to widen the limits of traditional treatment and obtain an exact solution to the scattering problem.

The general starting point of the theory is Matveev's theorem. DT modifies the ZRP boundary condition and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum. The ZRP can be dressed to improve its possibilities.\n3.

The text discusses the results of thermal conductivity measurements on two single crystals of YBaCuO high-temperature superconductor (YBCO) at different temperatures and magnetic fields. The measurements reveal a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity below a critical temperature (Tc) due to the presence of a predominant d-wave gap symmetry.\n2. The text also explains that the thermal conductivity patterns are influenced by the temperature dependence of the gap, the relative increase of the inelastic scattering rate, and the competition between thermal activation of quasiparticles in the direction of the thermal current and the gap structure.\n3.

A conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies was proposed based on the observation that gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form under conformally-flat metrical fields.\n2. Two scalar fields were introduced to spontaneously break the symmetry down to @xmath8 and @xmath9 symmetry, respectively.\n3. A symmetric second-order tensor field was defined as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.\n4. Quarks and gluons, which do not couple to this tensor field, are confined to an anti-de Sitter (ads) universe with a finite radius in the flat space-time.\n5. The model describes quarks and gluons oscillating with a universal frequency inside a closed universe, as well as photons freely traveling through flat space-time.\n6. The model comprises one real scalar field @xmath10 and one complex scalar field @xmath11.\n7. The dynamical equations for the scalar fields were solved for the case that the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy a certain relation, leading to ads confinement via the associated conformally flat metric.\n8.

Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have received attention due to their calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariant soft terms. However, they suffer from negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal scalar mass.\n2. Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB but localizes supersymmetry breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region. The warping suppresses tree-level gravity and anomaly mediation contributions, making the anomaly mediation the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector, except for the bino mass.\n3. The bino mass can lead to a small perturbation or the largest soft supersymmetry breaking parameter in the visible sector, depending on its size. It can affect the spectrum of anomaly mediation through renormalization group evolution. In extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), additional singlets can communicate supersymmetry breaking to the MSSM sector.\n4. Anomaly mediation and hypercharge mediation cure phenomenological shortcomings of each other. The minimal AMSB model predicts negative mass squared for sleptons and relatively heavy squarks, while the pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms and relatively heavy sleptons. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.\n5. The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if the bino mass is not too large, due to the presence of chargino and neutralino candidates in cascade decay events. The mass ordering in the hCAMSB model gives rise to a crucial distinction in lhc susy cascade decay events, which may serve to distinguish the two models.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5}}

The text discusses the results of a redshift survey of the Corona Borealis supercluster, which was primarily motivated by the study of the dynamics of the supercluster but also provides data suitable for investigating the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function (LF).\n2. The authors find that the local LF of galaxies, when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields, agrees well with the Large Area Survey (LAS) and the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). However, the normalization of the local LF is roughly a factor of 1.6 higher than that of the Stromlo/APM survey.\n3. The authors observe evolution of the field galaxy LF within their sample, confirming the conclusions drawn from several previous redshift surveys. The evolution is limited to the population of blue, star-forming galaxies, which become more luminous with increasing redshift.\n4. The LFs of the two superclusters show significant differences from the field galaxy LF, despite considerable overall similarity. The most prominent difference is an excess of very bright galaxies relative to the best-fitting Schechter function, which accurately describes the field LF over the observed absolute magnitude range. These very bright galaxies are found in very dense regions of the superclusters and have spectra dominated by an old, red stellar population.\n5. The authors suggest that the excess of very bright galaxies in the superclusters may be due to the influence of the environment on galaxy formation and evolution.

At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies greater than 100 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets.\n4.

The essential degrees of freedom for understanding electric conductivity, heat capacity, etc. in crystals are \"heavy electrons\" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interaction.\n4. In QCD, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important phenomenon for understanding the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties.\n5. Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by the exchange of goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.\n6. The chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to a lower symmetry by the QCD vacuum in the large limit.\n7. Evidence for spontaneously broken chiral symmetry includes a nonzero value of the quark condensates for light flavors, which is confirmed by current algebra, QCD sum rules, and lattice gauge calculations.\n8. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry results in the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass and the acquisition of dynamical mass by valence quarks, which have been called constituent quarks.\n9.

The reaction of the front fork to the action of braking and the anti-lock braking device is to begin to dive.\n5.

In one embodiment, a pressure transducer is installed at a desired depth in a borehole, connected to a filter and a check valve equipped with a pressure relief valve. The check valve opens at a predetermined pressure to prevent a standing fluid level in the fluid monitoring zone.\n3. The installation involves lowering the pressure transducer into the formation on the end of a cable, along with a conduit, and then cement grouting of the borehole is undertaken while the conduit is staged-injected with fluid to clear the filter of grout and then displace the grout so that the filter is in communication with the formation pressure to be measured.\n4. In another embodiment, a conduit is run into the borehole and filled with fluid and a non-return valve is used to prevent fluid from being pushed out of the conduit due to density or pumping pressure difference. Once grouting is complete, a small volume of fluid is pumped through the conduit to clean the filter, followed by the pumping of additional fluid into the conduit to displace the grout in the borehole radially around the inlet filter.\n5. In a further embodiment, a method of monitoring a fluid pressure in a subterranean formation includes forming a borehole, placing a conduit into the borehole to a depth so that a bottom inlet end of the conduit is laterally adjacent a location where the formation pressure is to be measured, using a non-return valve in the conduit so that liquid cannot pass upwardly all the way through the conduit, and pumping a liquid down the conduit to displace the cementitious material around the bottom inlet end of the conduit to form a fluid connection to the formation.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5}}

The tool has a mandrel connected to the surface through a string, with a passage in fluid communication with the string for pressure delivery.\n4. Pressure in the passage pushes down on the mandrel and pistons attached to it, displacing fluid from a chamber and imparting force in a downward direction on the string.\n5.

To install the cooling fan assembly, a combined compressive and rotating force is applied to the assembly or the panel, compressing the spring member and moving the turned-out portions fully into the recess.

The driven disc assembly must have precise thickness and be free of excessive warpage to avoid contact with the pressure plate when disengaged.\n4. A prior test fixture involved mounting the driven disc assembly between stationary and movable rings, measuring warpage by the amount of torque required to rotate it, and generating a visual indication of the test results.\n5. The invention includes an enclosure with a stationary ring and a movable ring, a torque motor with a splined hub for mounting the driven disc assembly, and means for selectively moving the movable ring to frictionally engage the driven disc assembly.\n6. The apparatus measures the distance between the rings when the driven disc assembly is engaged and the amount of torque required to rotate it when the frictional force is gradually reduced.\n7.

A power system includes a battery with plurality of cells and a controller that causes cells to acquire charge for a period of time, allowing voltages to approximate equality at the end of the period.\n3. The rate at which charge is acquired by cells may differ for some cells during a determined portion of the period.\n4. A battery cell's maximum capacity can be found using the relationship between change in capacity, change in state of charge, and voltage.\n5. A battery cell's energy content can be approximated using the power applied to the cell over time and the voltage and current associated with the power stored.\n6. The power provided by each cell is contributing to the total output power of the string, and cells with greater Amp-hr capacity contribute more power and energy.\n7. To ensure all cells have enough energy to meet the vehicle trip requirements, the cells should be charged to a voltage based on the minimum Amp-hr cell, but not so low that the minimum cell cannot provide enough energy for the trip.\n8. The time required to charge the battery pack depends on the cell requiring the greatest \u0394Ihrs, the cell requiring the least \u0394Ihrs, the method of balancing cells, and the portion of the charge cycle selected for balancing.\n9. Cell voltage balancing to achieve a target drive range involves determining the voltages of each cell, maximum capacity of each cell, common voltage needed for each cell, charge time for the battery pack, and resistive circuitry activation time for each cell. The controller then balances and charges the cells using any suitable technique or activates the resistive circuitry for each cell and deactivates it when the activation time expires. Once all resistive circuitry has been deactivated, the battery charger is disabled, and the cells have been balanced and charged to a target voltage sufficient to support a desired drive range.\n\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9}}

Since then, several pieces of legislation have strengthened NFIP, including making flood insurance mandatory for properties in vulnerable areas with mortgages from federally regulated lenders, and offering grant programs for repetitive loss properties.\n3. NFIP offers subsidized and full-risk premiums, with subsidized rates applying to about 22 percent of all policies. However, these subsidized rates do not fully reflect the actual risk of loss, leading to potential taxpayer costs.\n4. To address this issue, increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss, including catastrophic losses, would result in premiums that more closely approximate private insurer rates, decreasing taxpayer costs and encouraging private market participation.\n5. Mitigation efforts, such as elevation, relocation, and demolition, can reduce the risk of flood damage and put NFIP on a firmer financial footing. FEMA has made efforts to address repetitive loss properties through mitigation, but the number of such properties has continued to grow.\n6. To limit costs to taxpayers, NFIP needs to generate enough in premiums to pay claims, even in years with catastrophic losses. This goal is closely tied to eliminating subsidies and other reduced rates, and increasing mitigation efforts can further reduce flood damage and taxpayer costs.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6}}

In 1988, FDIC provided $970 million in open bank assistance to First City, which included a capital infusion and the creation of a collecting bank to dispose of certain troubled assets. The agreement also required First City to reduce its subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20.\n3. Between 1988 and 1990, First City reported profits and paid cash dividends, but these profits depended on nontraditional and onetime sources of income. During this period, First City's loan portfolios included high-risk loans, such as loans to finance highly leveraged transactions, international loans, and out-of-territory lending.\n4. By September 1990, problems with the quality of its loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded First City's capital.

The Tellico Dam controversy in Tennessee in the 1970s led to the creation of the exemption process, which allows federal agencies to balance the national interest in protecting listed species against the national interest in proceeding with an important federal project.\n7. The exemption process is complex and could take up to 280 days, involving multiple steps such as application submission, Secretary determination, formal hearing, and ESC decision, and it may still result in legal challenges and conflicts with other laws.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

In 2009, there was renewed interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs) due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes. Advocates argue that stricter import controls would prevent unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage domestic production, and raise milk prices for farmers. Opponents contend that such measures would increase costs for food manufacturers and result in higher retail food prices.\n2. The United States imports a significant amount of dairy products, with cheese being the largest share and MPCs and casein/caseinates representing 35% of total import value. The U.S. produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, and some economists suggest that federal dairy policies have encouraged the production of nonfat dry milk at the expense of milk protein concentrate or casein.\n3.

A German epidemiologic study suggested a specific cancer risk associated with glargine, but the findings were controversial and three additional studies were commissioned to confirm or refute the findings.\n6. The studies had various limitations, including the lack of prospective treatment allocation, insufficient insulin dose data, and the exclusion of patients on combination insulin therapy.\n7. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues, and cancer, as well as the potentially protective effects of metformin and the reason why diabetes is not more strongly associated with cancer.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7}}

The patient underwent impression taking using smallest size stock trays, border molding, and final impression making with light body polyvinyl siloxane addition silicon impression material. Hinge assemblies were incorporated between the two sections of the dentures using self-cure acrylic resin.\n2. Different techniques for fabricating sectional and hinged dentures for patients with microstomia are documented in the literature. In cases where microstomia is not manageable by surgeries or dynamic opening devices, modified impression procedures and prosthesis designs facilitate prosthetic rehabilitation. The use of sectional impression techniques and/or sectional dentures can help overcome clinical difficulties.\n3. Simplified sectional tray design and ease of fabrication are the major advantages of this technique. This technique can be accomplished in any dental laboratory without using complicated machinery or attachment devices for sectioning or assembling the trays/prosthesis together. The press buttons and mandibular molar bands are easily available and easy to maintain. However, this technique shares disadvantages common to all sectional tray/prosthesis designs, such as additional time, labor, and materials.

Risk factors include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases. Prognostic and therapeutic options depend on the severity of underlying liver disease, with median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced disease estimated at 58 months. HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations.\n2. The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is multifactorial and reliant upon dysregulation of multiple pathways, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, c-Met. HGF promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. HGF-cMet signaling is critical for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair after acute injury. Dysregulated HGF-cMet signaling is implicated in cellular invasion and metastases through induction of increased proliferation, migration and mobility, three-dimensional epithelial cell organization, and angiogenesis.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 2}}

Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, and consumption of caloric foods. Adipose tissue secretes pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and the presence of large concentrations of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet promotes inflammation.\n2. During menopause, the loss of estrogen production leads to adverse changes in lipoproteins, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The inflammatory processes following menopause result from a reduction in circulating levels of estrogens and their receptors, which have anti-inflammatory properties.\n3. In this study, rats were fed a control or hyperlipidic diet for 4 weeks, and then ovariectomized or sham-operated. The results showed that a hyperlipidic diet caused a decrease in il-6 and il-10 levels in mes adipose tissues, while ovariectomy combined with a hyperlipidic diet decreased the tnf- content of mes adipose tissues.\n4. Ovariectomy promotes increased adiposity, particularly in rats receiving a hyperlipidic diet, due to decreased uncoupling protein-1 (ucp-1) activity in brown adipose tissue and increased adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (lpl) activity.\n5.

Intermittent claudication is a common symptom of mild to moderate atherosclerotic PAD, affecting approximately 5% of individuals over 60 years old.\n2. Oxidative stress, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a role in the development and progression of PAD. Risk factors for PAD, like high total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, are similar to those for coronary heart disease.\n3. Statins, which lower lipid levels, also have pleiotropic effects, such as improving endothelial function, reducing oxidative stress, and affecting lipid metabolism enzyme activities. Statins are suggested for three reasons: preventing coronary heart disease, treating lower extremity PAD, and perioperative treatment of PAD patients.\n4. The present study aimed to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of PAD patients before and after surgery, comparing them to a group on simvastatin therapy. The study found that PAD patients had higher total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels before surgery and enhanced oxidative stress, as indicated by elevated MDA levels. However, no significant decrease in LOOH and MDA concentrations was observed after surgery. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as Frap) and thiol group concentrations were similar before surgery and on simvastatin therapy. However, a decrease in Frap level and thiol group concentrations was observed 35 days postoperatively and 710 days after surgery, which was lower than those in patients treated with simvastatin. An increase in ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was also observed in group i patients 710 days after surgery. All studied parameters in group i patients before surgery were significantly correlated with mean changes at 35 days and/or 710 days after surgery.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4}}

Each myova dimer consists of a pair of n-terminal motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain.\n3. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in a processive motion of each head taking 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.\n4. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of myova, but in the presence of high calcium (>1 m), motor processivity is reduced, and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm.\n5. Calmodulin dissociation may render the lever arm highly compliant, reducing the efficiency of both the lever arm displacement amplification and the strain-dependent gating between the two heads, which are necessary for the motor's processivity.\n6. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains.\n7. TPM involves anchoring a myova-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor. Thermal energy causes the qdot to be randomly displaced, and the resulting motion is measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered qdot to a stationary reference qdot.\n8. The flexural stiffness for the various myova constructs was determined by equipartition due to thermal energy, resulting in Brownian motion of the tethered qdot relative to the actin filament. The persistence length of the tether was calculated directly from the motion of the tethered qdot relative to actin and the length of the molecule.\n9.

The median time to complete closure was 15 weeks, with 25th and 75th percentiles at 9.6 weeks and 21.4 weeks, respectively.\n5. The analysis used percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT) as surrogate markers of complete healing.\n6. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.\n7. The association between the surrogate variables and the final outcome (complete ulcer closure) was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the correct classification index.\n8.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1 (PGC-1) gene is involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, beta-cell insulin secretion, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and glucose transport in muscle.\n4. Our studies showed associations of PGC-1 loci with T2D in different populations.\n5. Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) protein can regulate the expression of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) gene by stimulating the activity of the MFN2 promoter.\n6. ESRRA is a vital regulator involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, adaptive energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism.\n7. MFN2 gene maps on chromosome 1p36.22 and serves as a mitochondrial fusion protein regulating their morphology and distribution.\n8. We evaluated the associations between the MFN2 and ESRRA genetic polymorphisms and T2D and estimated the interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1 on the T2D risk in Han Chinese.\n9. We found that the c allele of rs2878677 of MFN2 gene in the diabetic group was lower than in the control group, and there was a borderline association between genotype distributions of rs873458 of MFN2 gene and T2D.\n10. The allele frequencies and genotype distributions of rs873458 and rs2878677 of MFN2 gene had more significant effects on T2D susceptibility in the combined populations.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 10}}

Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (CYP2C19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis.\n4. A recent study suggested that paraoxonase-1 (PON1) may be the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of 2-oxo-clopidogrel to thiol clopidogrel, and a common polymorphism of PON1 (Q192R) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the QQ (AA) haplotype.\n5. In two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting, the PON1 (QQ192) genotype was associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis, and reduced plasma activity of PON1 and the PON1 (QQ192) genotype were associated with reduced active thiol metabolite exposure and reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel in a group of patients with a history of prior stent thrombosis.\n6.

Strains may exhibit naturally complementary metabolism or be genetically engineered to interact, sharing metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose.\n4. Interacting partners may show enhanced proliferation through the mechanism of invested benefits, where cooperation on the part of one strain augments the growth of the other by increasing its abundance and cultivating the source of metabolites.\n5. The growth of a given strain relates to its level of cooperation, as inferred from the growth of its partner strain, and is influenced by the limit of oversharing, where excess cooperation allows one strain to monopolize the batch culture and limit the growth of the other.\n6. Synthetic genetic interactions, such as smit interactions, can be applied to infer properties of the e. coli metabolic network by identifying epistatic or modular relationships among genes.\n7. Metabolic network stoichiometries can be used to infer biochemical reaction rates through the method of flux balance analysis, which can be extended to a system of two interacting strains to allow for the free exchange of metabolites between them.\n8.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders caused by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion.\n2. The most common CAH variant is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).\n3. CAH patients with 21-OHD experience hyperplasia of the adrenal gland due to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens.\n4. CAH patients exhibit different clinical forms, including classical CAH (salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and non-classical CAH (asymptomatic or postnatal/adult onset hyperandrogenism).\n5. CAH treatment involves replacement of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and suppress abnormal androgen secretion. However, conventional glucocorticoid replacement cannot mimic natural cortisol rhythms, leading to over-suppression or under-suppression.\n6. Studies suggest high concordance rates between genotype and phenotype in patients with classic CAH. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities have been reported in CAH patients, including white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis.\n7.

The past 20 years have seen the development of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) signaling pathway in cancer. Avastin (bevacizumab), a VEGFA mAb, has been successful in treating colorectal, lung, and renal cell carcinomas.\n2. However, the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments have been highlighted by the recent withdrawal of avastin for breast cancer treatment in the US. Resistance to avastin and the role of other growth factors in sustaining tumor angiogenesis have been identified. Alternative ligands for the angiogenic receptor VEGFR-2, such as VEGFC and VEGFD, and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families are being explored as potential candidates for promoting resistance to avastin.\n3. PIGF, a ligand for VEGFR-1, has been reported to play a dual role in cancer as a stimulator of angiogenesis and as an autocrine or paracrine factor promoting proliferation of tumor cells expressing VEGFR-1. Its role in driving tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth is context-dependent, and it may modulate the effect of VEGFA by displacing VEGFA from VEGFR-1 expressed on endothelial cells.\n4. The growth factors VEGFC and VEGFD, which are closely related to VEGFA, have been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, solid tumor growth, and lymphatic and distant organ metastasis. Targeting the VEGFD signaling pathway could inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, restricting both solid tumor growth and metastatic spread.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4}}

These findings supported the hypothesis that a specific population of cells was responsible for propagation and sustained growth in a hierarchical manner.\n2. Stem cells have been identified throughout the lung, including in proximal and middle airways, by their role in response to injury. In the trachea, basal cells expressing either keratin-5 (k5) or keratin-14 (k14) have been identified as capable of stem-like behavior. In the middle airways, mature clara cells have been identified as facultative progenitor cells, capable of proliferating into phenotypically diverse progeny.\n3. Recent studies have identified tumor cell subpopulations within lung cancer specimens that exhibit stem-like properties, including multidrug resistance, increased telomerase expression, and self-renewal. CD133 cells isolated from human lung cancer specimens can grow indefinitely in culture and proliferate into phenotypically diverse tumors. Patients with lung tumors enriched with these CD133 lung cancer stem cells tend to have worse prognosis and increased resistance to cisplatin-based therapies.\n4. The hierarchical or cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that relatively rare, multipotent cells gain unlimited proliferative potential, leading to tumor growth and heterogeneity. Stem-like cells, with the ability to rapidly proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny, could act as cancer stem cells.\n5. The study of lung epithelial response to airway injury has shown compelling evidence for the role of stem cells in airway repair.

Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have revealed the hierarchical folding of the genome into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs).\n2. TADs, which range from 100 kb up to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.\n3. TAD boundaries are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions, and are enriched for specific proteins, histone modifications, and replication timing.\n4. The underlying features that generate invariant TAD boundaries remain unknown, but they have been associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and the timing of replication domains.\n5. In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of different types of insulators is associated with the strength of the TAD boundary.\n6. Brg1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, contributes to TAD boundary strength and regulates nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization.\n7. Brg1 knockdown results in reduced nucleosome occupancy around CTCF sites, decreased TAD boundary strength, and a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.\n8. The interplay and functional cooperativity between CTCF, Brg1, and topoisomerases in the organization of TADs via the active regulation of TAD boundary regions is supported by recent findings.\n9.

Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs. These models help identify specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.\n3. An alternative approach to appetite control comes from the study of energy balance and the interrelationships between energy expenditure and energy intake. Any increase in energy expenditure will be met with an equivalent increase in energy intake, but daily energy expenditure can fluctuate markedly, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) provides a tonic signal of energy demand that could act as a driver of daily energy intake. Physical activity energy expenditure exerts a different type of control over appetite due to its intensity and sporadic nature, and exercise can raise resting energy expenditure several fold, leading to complex effects on appetite control.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 3}}

In addition to RISC-mediated regulation at the post-transcriptional level, RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself.\n4. In fission yeast, homologs of the RISC can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNAs, a mechanism also seen in plants, ciliates, nematodes, and flies.\n5. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing.\n6.

Methadone, a frequently used drug in therapies including opioid addiction and pain management, has been reported to negatively impact human cognition and cause impaired cognitive abilities in aspects such as psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem solving, memory, decision making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition.\n2. Changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) are involved in control of various cellular and physiological processes including neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription. However, a dramatic increase in [Ca]cyt can result in a death signal, known as delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), which may be the irreversible end point of a sequence involving mitochondrial calcium overloading.\n3. In the present study, the mechanisms underlying methadone-induced rises in [Ca]cyt in sh-sy5y cells were investigated. Four different types of calcium recordings were observed: type 1 (no rise in [Ca]cyt), type 2 (continuous rise in [Ca]cyt), type 3 (deregulation with a delay), and type 4 (transient responsive cells). Methadone decreased type 4 cells and increased types 2 and 3, suggesting that methadone may induce a short or delayed calcium deregulation in sh-sy5y cells.\n4. A comprehensive pharmacological survey was performed to study the possible contribution of different calcium-related mechanisms to the response to methadone. Results suggested that methadone-induced calcium deregulation is independent of opioid receptors and may be partially due to release from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular calcium stores. The role of mitochondria in methadone-induced DCD was also investigated, and it was found that drugs affecting mitochondrial handling of calcium, such as oligomycin, fccp, cgp37157, and cyclosporine a, were able to modulate methadone-induced DCD in sh-sy5y cells.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4}}

The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using a midurethral sling was first described by Delorme to reduce complications associated with the retropubic approach.\n2. A similar transobturator passage using an inside-out approach was later described by de Leval to further reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder.\n3. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator mus procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence.\n4. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective.\n5. This study aimed to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis.\n6. The study revealed that the mus tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior and that the out-in muss were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the in-out muss.\n7. The mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the in-out mus measured 122 (95%ci: 107-136) versus 144 (95%ci: 131-151) for the out-in mus (p = 0.02).\n8. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory.\n9. The findings from this study demonstrate the importance of strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique and highlight the need for further research to correlate static anatomic findings with clinical outcomes.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9}}
