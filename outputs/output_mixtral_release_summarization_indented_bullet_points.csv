• The transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that direct particle transport and are of interest due to their potential for extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations in biological systems.
• Recent research has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets, which are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes. The behavior of these systems is complex and can change dramatically as parameters change, leading to changes in transport properties.
• A study by Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, defined as the time and ensemble-averaged velocity, can change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current direction and bifurcations in the trajectory dynamics.
• A later investigation by Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals can occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits. However, their arguments implicitly assume ergodicity, which is not always true for chaotic systems.
• The behavior of chaotic systems can depend strongly on the initial ensemble, and this has implications for experimental validation of results. A study of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet, specifically the system considered by Mateos and Barbi and Salerno, is reported.
• The study considers the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and shows that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble. It is important to discard transients in quantifying the current.
• The study finds evidence for a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture: bifurcations in trajectory dynamics are associated with abrupt changes in the current, but not necessarily current reversals.
• The goal of the studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets by considering specific systems in detail before generalizing.

* Extrasolar planet discoveries have revealed a wide range of eccentricities, with many planets having moderate to high eccentricities.
	+ This is surprising as the planets in our own solar system have relatively circular orbits.
* There are several theories as to the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets.
	+ One such method is planet-planet scattering, where multiple jovian planets interact and leave one in an eccentric orbit.
* Another possible way to boost a planet's eccentricity is through interactions with stellar companions.
	+ The Kozai mechanism can induce large-amplitude oscillations in a planet's eccentricity if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large.
* To investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six systems, test particle simulations were performed.

* EPR-steering is a special case of the steering phenomenon, which is a subset of non-separable states.
	+ EPR-steering allows for the verification of entanglement even when one party or their detectors cannot be trusted.
	+ A bipartite state is EPR-steerable if and only if it allows for a demonstration of EPR-steering.
* The steering ellipsoid formalism is used to study steering in two-qubit states.
	+ The steering ellipsoid is the set of steered Bloch vectors that can be obtained by measuring one qubit and steering the other.
	+ The surface of the steering ellipsoid is defined by the set of steered Bloch vectors, and its center and semiaxes are determined by the matrix of the steering ellipsoid.
* The volume of the steering ellipsoid is strictly bounded for separable states, and a two-qubit state is separable if and only if its steering ellipsoid is contained within a tetrahedron within the Bloch sphere.

* The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, the calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in primitive chondritic meteorites.
	+ This suggests that at least some of the solar system's SLRIs may have been injected into the presolar cloud or the solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
	+ Injection occurred as a single, spatially heterogeneous event, which may reduce the usefulness of @xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation.
	+ Previous models have shown how initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and small particles.
* Other elements and their isotopes suggest a well-mixed solar nebula, but stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous during the early phases of planet formation.
	+ The leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, where self-shielding could lead to isotopic fractionation.
	+ This process would be continuous in time, rather than a single-shot event like a supernova shock wave.
	+ The very existence of refractory particles in comet 81P/Wild 2 implies that these small particles experienced large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula.
* MGU disks offer a means to accomplish this early large-scale transport and are likely involved in FU Orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars.

* Magnetic fields or waves are believed to play a key role in this heating process.
- The primary energy source for this heating must lie in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.
* There is 100 times as much energy available in the convection zone as required to heat the corona.
- The debate over the energy source for coronal heating centers on two main theories: dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves and numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events (nanoflares).
- MHD waves can be generated by the buffeting of magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere by granulation.
* These waves can propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona.
- In coronal loops, random motions of magnetic loop footpoints can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines.
* This can generate field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.
- A new setup will be used to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations, which could provide evidence for wave heating mechanisms.

• The text discusses the use of shower parton distributions (SPDs) to describe the fragmentation of partons into hadrons in high-energy collisions.

• SPDs are determined from the evolution of fragmentation functions (FFs), which are calculated using perturbative QCD and fitted to data from experiments.

• The recombination model is used to relate the SPDs to the FFs, which assumes that the fragmentation process can be described as the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons in the medium.

• The text presents a method for solving the integral equations that relate the SPDs to the FFs, which involves fitting the FFs to the experimental data and solving the equations numerically.

• The usefulness of SPDs is demonstrated through two examples: the production of hadrons in the environment of thermal partons, and the study of dihadron distributions in a jet.

• The first example shows that the contribution from thermal-shower recombination is more important than fragmentation in the range of transverse momentum shown, demonstrating the necessity of knowing the SPDs in a jet.

• The second example shows that the two-particle distribution cannot be adequately represented by the FFs alone, due to the presence of terms that cannot be written in factorizable form.

• The text also highlights the importance of the shower parton distributions in problems where the knowledge of the fragmentation functions alone is not sufficient to provide answers to questions concerning the interaction between a jet and its surrounding medium or between particles within a jet.

• The authors emphasize that the basic hadronization process is recombination, even for fragmentation in vacuum, and that the shower parton distributions obtained are model-dependent.

• The extension of the recombination model to higher transverse momentum and heavy-ion collisions at super high energies is also discussed.

• A new iterative procedure is proposed to solve this problem, based on locally approximating the nonconvex feasible set by an inner convex set. The convergence of the algorithm to a stationary point is analyzed under standard assumptions. The method is applied to optimization problems with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, which are known to be nonconvex and NP-hard.

• The text also presents a new local optimization method for solving the nonconvex semidefinite programming problem. The method approximates the feasible set of the nonconvex problem by a sequence of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation sets. This approach can be considered as a generalization of existing methods that use convex semidefinite programming techniques to solve optimization problems with BMI constraints.

A psd-convex matrix mapping is a matrix-valued function that is convex with respect to the positive semidefinite ordering of matrices.

• Differential geometry has been valuable in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories, with the Dirac-Khler formulation of fermionic field theory being of particular interest. This formulation uses the antisymmetry inherent in the product between differential forms to describe the Clifford algebra.
• To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, which would ideally have the same properties as the continuum and the correct continuum limit. Defining such a scheme has proven to be challenging, with difficulties often exhibited by the Hodge star and the wedge product between forms.
• Several discrete schemes have been proposed to address these difficulties, including the use of a lattice to define operators with desirable properties but non-locality, and the introduction of translation operators to resolve non-locality. Other proposals include the use of a lattice with specific non-commutativity between fields and discrete forms, and the use of a quantized phase space to regularize the system.

• The Dirac-Khler formulation has been proposed as a way to describe chiral symmetry in the associated lattice fermionic field theory.

- **Standard Model Limitations and New Physics Models**
  * Global fits to precision measurements are used to limit models with physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and infer information about the parameters of new models.
  * The SM predicts the W boson mass in terms of other parameters, with a strong correlation to the experimentally measured top quark mass.
  * Models with new physics often introduce additional parameters, requiring a different renormalization scheme and leading to incorrect results when considering one-loop contributions.

- **Renormalization and Scalar Mass Dependence**
  * The SM satisfies certain conditions at tree level, but these do not hold in models with new physics.
  * The renormalization of a theory with a real triplet Higgs at tree level is fundamentally different from that of the SM, requiring a fourth input parameter.
  * The dependence on scalar masses in the W boson mass is quadratic, and the triplet is non-decoupling, meaning it must be included in any effective field theory analysis of low energy physics.

- **Scalar Potential and Minimization Conditions**
  * The scalar potential of the model with a triplet and a doublet is given by six parameters, two of which contribute to the gauge boson masses.
  * The mixing angles in the neutral and charged Higgs sectors are solutions to equations obtained by minimizing the scalar potential.
  * The second derivatives of the scalar potential provide information about the mixing between the doublet and the triplet.

• The interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance.

• A common way to calculate addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle description, which ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons.

• The adequacy of the quasiparticle description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).

• Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly used to calculate the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO, but it may not always provide accurate results, particularly for molecules.

• The formation of the image charge when a molecule approaches a metallic surface has a non-local nature, which can be challenging to capture with traditional DFT functionals.

• A possible solution is to use an explicit many-body approach, such as the GW approximation, which can capture the energy levels renormalization due to the image charge effect.

• Constrained density functional theory (CDFT) can be used to evaluate the charge transfer energies of an organic molecule physisorbed on an inorganic substrate in a more resource-efficient manner.

• CDFT avoids the calculation of a quasiparticle spectrum and replaces it with a series of total energy calculations for different charge distributions, making it a useful tool for studying the adsorption of molecules on surfaces.

* Atomic clocks rely on atoms with a stable resonance frequency, but they also require an active oscillator
* Two problems in designing atomic clocks: resonance shifts with clock construction and operation details, and oscillator drift
* Problem (a) is addressed by introducing a wave function parametrized by radiation intensity and other factors, defining the SI second as the resonance at absolute zero temperature
* Problem (b) is handled by computer-mediated feedback adjusting the oscillator based on detections of scattering by the clock atoms
* The choice of a wave function to explain experimental evidence is not unconditionally knowable and can require revision
* Uncertainty in quantum theory creates a gap between explanations and evidence, with the distinction between linear operators and probabilities implying that evidence can't definitively confirm an explanation
* Clocks generating Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) are steered toward aiming points determined by a chosen wave function and an hypothesized metric tensor field
* The unknowability of wave functions has implications for the second as a unit of measurement in the SI, as well as for digital communications and spacetime with a metric tensor
* The discipline of logical synchronization addresses questions related to patterns of channels, hypotheses about signal propagation, and the use of hypothesized aiming points for steering drifting clocks

• The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the charge neutrality condition and beta equilibrium are required, which can cause mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks.
• The Cooper pairing will eventually be destroyed with the increase of mismatch, leading to a first-order phase transition or a non-uniform Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fudde-Ferrell (LOFF) state in a certain window of moderate mismatch.
• The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system. If the charge neutrality condition is satisfied globally and the surface tension is small, the mixed phase will be favored.
• Homogeneous neutral cold-dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2sc) or gapless CFL (gcfl) phase, depending on the flavor structure of the system.
• The existence of thermal stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed and generalized to finite temperatures. Recent results show that the g2sc and gcfl phases can exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram.
• In the g2sc phase, the Meissner screening masses for five gluons corresponding to broken generators become imaginary, indicating a type of chromomagnetic instability. This instability might be cured by a LOFF state or a gluon condensate state.

• Star formation in clusters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; The vast majority of stars are formed in star clusters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; During the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud into a star cluster, only a modest percentage of the gas is turned into stars.
&nbsp;&bull; A star cluster will initially consist of a combination of gas and stars.

• Gas removal from clusters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; At the onset of stellar winds and supernova explosions, enough energy is injected into the gas within the embedded cluster to remove the gas on short timescales.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; The resulting gas-free cluster is out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy caused by the loss of a significant fraction of its mass.
&nbsp;&bull; The effects of gas removal on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) have received little consideration in observational studies of young massive star clusters.

• Observational studies of young massive star clusters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Many studies have attempted to constrain the IMF in clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Discrepant results have been reported, with some studies finding non-standard IMFs and others finding standard Kroupa or Salpeter type IMFs.
&nbsp;&bull; Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, with younger clusters showing a significant scatter.

• The case of M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; These clusters reside in nearby starburst galaxies and have been reported to have non-standard stellar IMFs.

* The glass transition, a topic of statistical physics, is associated with a sharp increase in relaxation times and a departure from equilibrium in experiments.
	+ Theoretically, it is proposed that this transition is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic transition, known as the ""ideal"" glass transition, occurring at the Kauzmann temperature.
	+ However, this view is questioned by experimental data and simulations of polydisperse hard-core disks, which fail to detect any evidence of a thermodynamic transition.
* The Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT) is an alternative theoretical consideration that attempts to connect glass transition phenomena with the rapid increase in relaxation times near a critical temperature.
	+ The MCT predicts a transition from a high-temperature liquid state to a low-temperature arrested state at a critical temperature.
	+ Simulations have been conducted using models introduced by Stillinger and Weber and by Kob and Andersen, which have helped shape current views about the glass transition.

•• The longitudinal outcome process is modeled using a transition model.
•• The correlation within dyads is accounted for using random effects.
•• The model allows a subject's outcome to depend on their own and the other member's characteristics.
•• The parameters of the proposed model have appealing interpretations as ""actor"" and ""partner"" effects.

• **Accounting for Nonignorable Dropout:**

•• A discrete time survival model is adopted to link the dropout process with the longitudinal measurement process.
•• The data augment method is used to address the complex missing data problem caused by dropout and interdependence within dyads.

• **Simulation Study:**

•• The proposed method yields consistent estimates with correct coverage rates.

• **Application to Breast Cancer Study:**

•• The proposed method identifies more ""partner"" effects than methods that ignore the missing data.
•• This extra information can be useful for the design of more efficient depression prevention programs for breast cancer patients.

• **Assumptions and Limitations:**

•• The proposed dropout model assumes that time-dependent covariates have captured all important time-dependent factors that influence dropout.
•• A more flexible approach is to include a time-dependent random effect to represent all unmeasured time-variant factors that influence dropout.
•• The common random effect may not be the most effective modeling approach when dropout mostly occurs at the dyad level.
•• A more effective approach is to put a hierarchical structure on the coefficients of common covariates to reflect that dropout is almost always at the dyad level.

	+ The zero-point energy (per unit area) when the plates are kept at close distance is smaller than when the plates are at infinite separation.

	+ The force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions can be derived according to an analytical formula that relates the Helmholtz free energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field to the dielectric functions of the interacting materials and of the medium in which they are immersed.
	+ At very short distances, Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force.
	+ At larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction that in the case of two ideal metals in vacuum reduces to Casimir's result.

	+ For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.

* At weak coupling, these couplings can be evaluated using perturbation theory and Feynman diagrams. However, this approach is unpractical for obtaining exact results for general operators.
* A more promising approach is to explore integrability of planar N=4 SYM. However, how integrability will enter computations of the couplings C<sub>ijk</sub> remains unclear.
* One strategy to compute the couplings in a CFT is to deform the theory from its fixed point with a marginal or irrelevant operator. This deformation introduces new divergences in the renormalised operators of the critical theory, which are determined by the couplings C<sub>ij</sub>.
* In planar N=4 SYM, finding the action of such matrix on operators diagonalised by means of the Bethe ansatz is a new method to compute the couplings C<sub>ij</sub>.
* At strong coupling, the AdS/CFT correspondence can be used to compute the couplings C<sub>ijk</sub>. The duality relates the string partition function, computed with suitable boundary condition, to the generating functional for correlation functions of the gauge theory.
* A path integral approach to compute the string theory partition function for a heavy string state propagating between two boundary points has been developed. In this case, the string path integral is dominated by a classical saddle point, giving a new method to compute at strong coupling the 2-point function of single trace operators with a large number of basic fields.

• The hadronic final state of collisions at 200 gev can serve as a reference for other high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC. However, the theoretical and experimental descriptions of these collisions are currently incomplete.

• Several unresolved aspects of collisions are notable, including the role of collision centrality in relation to the low-x gluon transverse structure of the proton, the nature and systematics of the underlying event (ue), the systematics of minimum-bias dijet (minijet) production, and the possible existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component in 2d angular correlations.

• A more complete mathematical model for phenomenology based on the pT dependence of single-particle (sp) spectra and -integral densities and -integral 2d angular correlations is established in this study. The study also explores possible correspondence with centrality, ue structure, dijet production, and the partonic structure of projectile protons.

• The study presents a two-component model (tcm) for the systematics of hadron densities on pseudorapidity and a three-component model for the sp density and 2d angular-correlation measurements in pp collisions.

* AI3, a layered organic material, has recently regained interest due to the discovery of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure.
	+ Compared to graphene and 3D topological insulators, AI3 has several distinct features, such as tilted Dirac cones, anisotropic Fermi surface, and a smaller average Fermi velocity.
* The smaller Fermi velocity in AI3 indicates a stronger relevance of electronic correlations, with an expected effective coupling constant ten times larger than in graphene.
	+ This opens up the possibility to study strongly-correlated Dirac fermions, which are not accessible in graphene.
* Additionally, AI3 has specificities like the presence of massive carriers near the Fermi level and a topological merging of Dirac points under high but experimentally accessible pressure.
	+ Recent studies using magneto-transport measurements under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 GPa have shown the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes.
* The interplay between both carrier types and the scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers are the main results of these studies.
* The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
	+ Section 1 presents the experimental setup and results of magneto-transport measurements under hydrostatic pressure.
	+ Section 2 discusses the temperature dependence of carrier densities and mobilities, comparing them with models of massless Dirac fermions and massive carriers.
	+ Section 3 presents conclusions and future perspectives.
* Single crystals of AI3 were synthesized by electro-crystallization, with a typical size of 4 x 1 x 0.6 mm^3.
	+ Gold contacts were deposited for simultaneous longitudinal and transverse resistivity measurements.
* The analysis of data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity, similar to the one presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems.

• Origin of unconventional superconducting state in Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) is still debated
• FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides
• Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets and two electron sheets

• Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations
• Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure

• RPA-SF approach gives extended s-wave gap as the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations
• Orbital fluctuations promote order parameter to have sign-preserving s-wave symmetry

• Probing the gap structure can help in elucidating the underlying mechanism
• Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool to probe the gap structure

• Many reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra appearing only for T < Tc
• Common explanation is that the peak is the spin resonance appearing due to the s± state

• Simple explanation was indirectly questioned by ARPES results and recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy
• Larger gap is about 9meV and the smaller gap is about 4meV in BaCo122 materials

• Smaller gap located at the outer hole FS, raising the question of what would be the spin resonance frequency in the system with two distinct gaps
• Naive expectation is that the frequency shifts to the lower gap scale, but this is not consistent with the observed peak in INS in BaCo122 system

• True minimal energy scale is 28 meV, consistent with the maximal frequency of the observed peak in INS in BaCo122 and confirms that it is the true spin resonance

• Whether the minimal or maximal energy scale will be realized depends on the relation between the exact band structure of a particular material and the wave vector of the spin resonance

• Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often said to be unconditionally secure, but it requires that the users' devices meet certain requirements.
• In practice, it is difficult for devices to meet these requirements, leading to potential security breaches.
• Some attacks on QKD have been proposed and demonstrated successfully against practical QKD systems.
• To combat these attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proofs and experimental measures have been proposed.
• One promising idea is Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD), where neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement.
• MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing performance.
• The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is (almost) perfect.
• The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit, as it involves the estimation of the response of the devices to unknown input signals sent from Eve.
• With MDIQKD, the imperfections of the sources become the main focus, such as the basis-dependent flaw that stems from the discrepancy of the density matrices corresponding to the two bases in BB84 states.
• To investigate the practicality of MDIQKD, the security of MDIQKD under the imperfection needs to be generalized from previous works on standard BB84 with basis-dependent flaw.

• Explosion models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia):

	- The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explanation for SNe Ia.
	- This model suggests that a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star, increasing its mass until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes.
	- Recent progress in the accreting WD model includes the introduction of a stellar wind from the WD, which helps sustain stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
	- There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel.

• Identifying the companion star of a SN Ia:

	- The companion star is expected to be located inside the supernova remnant (SNR) ejecta.
	- When a star is inside the ejecta, photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us, forming broad wings in the blue side of absorption lines.
	- By observing these distinct absorption features in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible range, it may be possible to identify the companion star of a SN Ia.
	- However, there is a chance that a star other than the companion star may be inside the ejecta, so additional criteria may be necessary to confirm the companion's identity.

• Quantum entanglement is a feature of quantum mechanics that has captured recent interest due to its role in quantum information processing. It can be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization and obeys conservation laws.

• In a bipartite system with complete information, the state of the system is pure and the entropy of entanglement can be measured using the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix. However, when quantum systems interact with their environment, states become mixed and the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear.

• To address this issue, various measures of entanglement have been proposed, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation. These measures give the value zero for certain mixed states, which may seem counterintuitive but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state.

• Nha and Carmichael have introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based on quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. This approach considers the way in which information about the system is read from the environment and follows the evolution of the system conditioned on the measurement record. The entanglement measure is then contextual and dependent on the kind of measurements made.

• However, the traditional security analysis of the entanglement-based scheme in CVQKD only includes the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), leaving security loopholes.
• The fluctuations of LO intensity can affect the secret key rate in CVQKD systems, and monitoring LO intensity is necessary to confirm the security of the practical implementation.
• In a practical system, the local oscillator intensity is always monitored by splitting a small part with a beam splitter, but the effect of fluctuation, particularly small fluctuation, on the secret key rate is not yet fully understood.
• Reverse reconciliation is more sensitive to the fluctuation of LO intensity than direct reconciliation, and eve can intercept partial secret keys if she increases the channel excess noise of one part of the signal pulses when she controls the LO intensity.

• The effect of LO intensity fluctuation on the secret key rate estimation of alice and bob for reverse and direct reconciliation has been analyzed.
• Bob's estimation of the secret key rate will be compromised severely without monitoring LO or if his measurements do not scale with LO instantaneous intensity values.
• Eve could hide her attack partially by reducing the intensity of LO and even could steal the total secret keys alice and bob share without being found by a small attenuation of LO intensity, especially for reverse reconciliation.

However, the simplicity is now less evident due to the long development period and the flexibility it offers in choosing integration methods and determining all frequencies of a given model within a specified range of degree and frequency.

• The equilibrium model is defined in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as by mass and radius. The code provides extensive documentation and was inspired by previous work discussed in @xcite. The @xcite package carried out careful tests and comparisons of results on polytropic models, providing extensive tables of frequencies for comparison with other codes.

• The code introduces a new set of dependent variables for numerical integration, particularly for large degree modes, and solves the equations on the interval from the center to the outermost point, which is defined by the surface radius including the atmosphere. Boundary conditions are obtained from series expansions, a vanishing Lagrangian pressure perturbation condition, or a condition between pressure perturbation and displacement by matching continuously to the solution in an isothermal atmosphere.

• The programme permits solving the equations with two techniques: a shooting method and a relaxation technique. The shooting method integrates solutions separately from the inner and outer boundary and matches them at a suitable inner fitting point, while the relaxation technique solves the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique, finding the eigenvalue by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point.

• The text discusses the use of machine learning techniques, specifically autoencoders and variational autoencoders, to determine phase transitions in physical systems without any information about the microscopic theory or the order parameter.

• Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learn to encode the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, called the latent representation, and then decode it back to the original format. Variational autoencoders impose additional constraints on the distribution of the latent variables, transforming the autoencoder into a model that learns a latent variable model for its input data.

• The authors use autoencoders and variational autoencoders with one fully connected hidden layer in the encoder and decoder, each consisting of 256 neurons. The activation functions of the intermediate layers are rectified linear units, and the activation function of the final layer is a sigmoid or tanh function, depending on the problem.

• The authors test their algorithms on the Ising model and the XY model, which are well-studied and well-understood models in physics. They find that their algorithms are able to find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system, which coincides with the correct order parameter. The decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation, and the reconstruction is more accurate in the ordered phase. The authors suggest that the reconstruction error can be used as a universal identifier for phase transitions.

They note that the fidelity of the initial and output states for most of the Bloch sphere exceeds the value 5/6, which corresponds to the universal QCM for pure states. This is due to the fact that the QCM copies only part of the two-partite state and is state-dependent, which increases the quality of the cloning.

• Transitions in Aql X-1:
	• The text suggests that Aql X-1, a transient X-ray binary, is undergoing a transition to the propeller regime, followed by a transition to the radio pulsar regime as its transient X-ray emission approaches its quiescent level.
	• This transition makes Aql X-1 a potential ""missing link"" between low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXRBs) and recycled millisecond pulsars (MSPs).

• X-ray Emission and Neutron Star Properties:
	• The X-ray luminosity turn-off during the centrifugal barrier onset could be due to the spectral transition of the accretion disk, the ""propeller"" mechanism, or the neutron star spin-down energy dissipated into the inflowing matter.

	+ This subspace is a decoherence-free subspace (DFS), which is immune to decoherence processes, and the exchange interactions can be controlled purely electrically by gate potentials, providing much faster operations.

	+ Related effects included singularities near edges in absorption and emission spectra.
	+ The excitation of core levels by X-rays can lead to shake-up effects, where the core hole is screened by conduction band (CB) electrons, resulting in plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
* In a metal, the water waves in the cork-in-water analogy correspond to plasmons, collective excitations of CB electrons.
	+ Shake-up effects show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum, with the main peak at the adiabatic position and subsequent replicas shifted to lower kinetic energy.
	+ The shift in each replica is equal to the plasma frequency multiplied by the replica number.
* In a metallic system, single-particle excitations can also occur, leading to a deformation and low-energy tail in both the main peak and plasmon replicas.
	+ The low-energy tailing is a characteristic of metallic systems and can be used by experimentalists to find out where in a complex sample the core hole is situated.
	+ Several parameters were introduced by Doniach and Sunji to characterize XPS line shapes and are still broadly used by experimentalists in the fitting procedure for XPS spectra.
* In the present work, pristine and doped graphene are addressed.
	+ In the pristine case, the chemical potential is neither inside an energy band nor in a band gap, making this system special.
	+ In the doped case, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, and a tailing is found, but the 2D character of the system means that the collective excitations are 2D plasmons with a completely different dispersion than in ordinary 3D metallic systems.
* The 2D plasmons give contributions that start already from zero frequency and upwards, meaning that they contribute to the tail and no distinct plasmon replicas are distinguishable.

• A new approximation scheme is proposed to work better in the frozen phase and on the critical line.

• The Kauffman model is defined, where each element represents a gene and its binary variable represents the state of activation.
• Each element is controlled by other elements, and its state is determined by the states of its control genes and a response function.
• The control elements and response functions are chosen at random, and the properties of the model do not depend on the details of their distribution.

• The dynamics of the system obey a deterministic equation, but the system is disordered due to the randomly chosen control rules.
• The probability distributions of the number, length, and size of the attraction basins of the periodic orbits, as well as the distribution of transient times, are studied.

It reproduces the correct x\_0 to within ±0.08 for high photometric errors and ±0.03 for low photometric errors. However, it tends to underestimate x\_0 for moderate to large photometric errors and input x\_0.
  • The ""x\_25 slope"" method uses a linear fit between x\_74 and x\_75 and interpolates to unit slope. It gives x\_0 for ngc 4833 with a scatter of ±0.05 for high photometric errors and ±0.02 for low photometric errors. Some simulation categories display a small but significant bias in the measured x\_0.
  • The ""optical / ir"" method relies on two-color photometry and the sfd reddening map. It gives x\_0 for ngc 4833 with a low level of predictive power due to uncertainty in the sfd reddening values.

• The best estimate of the extinction law slope in the direction of ngc 4833 is x\_7, based on a weighted average of the values from the three determination methods.

• The sfd map is used to investigate the relationship between the variance spectrum and conventional angular power spectrum.

• The discovery of an overdensity of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars that may represent a dwarf galaxy or tidal debris.
• This overdensity, labeled the VRC (Vertical Extension of the Red Clump), is a massive foreground population with about 5% of the angular surface density of the LMC itself.
• If true, this conclusion would have profound consequences for the interpretation of galactic microlensing studies, as this stellar foreground population could be responsible for a sizable fraction of the microlensing signal toward the LMC.
• However, this explanation has been challenged on several grounds, including the lack of evidence for a foreground population in the MACHO team's extensive photometric database and the incompatibility of the feature's color with a foreground clump population.
• Gould (1997) argues that any luminous foreground population would have to meet certain criteria, such as not extending more than 5 degrees from the LMC center or having a stellar mass-to-light ratio 10 times that of known populations.
• Johnston (1998) concludes that an ad hoc tidal streamer to explain the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC would cause unobserved overdensities of 10-100% in star counts elsewhere in the Magellanic plane.
• Bennett (1997) argues that a recently determined stellar mass function combined with the assumption that the putative foreground population has a star formation history similar to the LMC results in an implied microlensing optical depth from the VRC that is only a small fraction of that determined by microlensing observations.
• The authors argue that the VRC feature originates in the LMC itself, due to stellar evolution rather than an intervening population.
• Using BVR CCD photometry of several fields at different locations in the LMC, the authors confirm the presence of substructure in LMC red clump morphology corresponding to the VRC.

• Broad emission iron lines are common features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating near the black hole due to radiation reflection on the accretion disc.

• The position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc, is determined by the spin of the black hole. The Laor model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used to describe these lines, but newer models allow for the spin to be fitted. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin if the inner edge of the disc is identified with the marginally stable orbit.

• The paper compares the Laor model to a newer model in fitting the iron lines of two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit skewed iron lines. The newer model provides a smoother adjustment between different points in the parameter space, allowing for more reliable constraints on the spin. The Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, which affects the determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.

• The investigation of the iron line band for two representative sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, shows that the iron line is statistically better constrained for the active galaxy MCG-6-30-15 due to a longer exposure time. The spectra of both sources are well described by a continuum model plus a broad iron line model.

• Recent efforts have focused on creating systems where two species of atoms condense simultaneously, partially achieved for two different hyperfine spin states of 87Rb.
• The dynamics of the complex relative motion of the condensates and the measurement of the relative phase between the two condensates have been studied.
• The two condensates have a substantial overlap but do not completely interpenetrate each other in the stationary state.
• A similar state, called a ""spinor condensate,"" has been observed for sodium gas.
• Theoretical investigation of two-component Bose systems has started many decades ago, with recent experiments with alkali atoms reviving interest in the theory.

• The stability, ground-state properties, and collective excitations of two-component BECs have been studied theoretically using the Gross-Pitaevskii equations.
• Many properties of two-component, or binary, BECs can be understood from symmetry arguments.
• Compared to one-component Bose superfluids, two-component systems have a more interesting pattern of symmetry and symmetry breaking.
• Condensation in binary BECs corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of two (instead of one) global U(1) symmetries.
• These symmetries are related to the separate conservation of the number of atoms of each of the two species.
• The quantum state of the binary Bose system is characterized by two phases of the two condensates.

• A very interesting feature specific to systems consisting of atoms of the same isotope in different spin states is that it is possible to couple two condensates by a driving electromagnetic field tuned to the transition frequency.
• In this case, atoms can be interconverted between the two spin states, and the numbers of atoms of each species are not conserved separately anymore; only the total number of atoms is constant.
• This implies that, in the presence of the coupling drive, only one U(1) symmetry remains exact, while the other one is explicitly violated.
• The preserved U(1) symmetry obviously comes from the conservation of the total number of atoms and corresponds to changing the phases of the two condensates by the same amount (i.e",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '•'}"

	+ In the quantum case, the classical conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor can be broken, leading to Einstein anomalies, Lorentz anomalies, or Weyl anomalies.
* Anomalies have been first found within perturbation theory and calculated using various methods, including Feynman diagrams, heat kernel method, Fujikawa's path integral approach, and mathematical techniques such as differential geometry, cohomology, and topology (index theorems).

Therefore, the superfield is assumed to couple to both the left-handed lepton doublet superfield and the right-handed neutrino superfield.

• Neutrino mass and supersymmetry breaking:

	- The scalar component of the chiral superfield is assumed to be the acceleron, which causes the present cosmic acceleration.

	+ A symmetric second-order tensor field is defined to serve as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.
	+ Quarks and gluons are confined to an anti-de-Sitter (AdS) universe with a finite radius in the flat space-time.

The main result is a sufficient condition for a knot that admits no purely cosmetic surgery in terms of its Jones polynomial.

• Anomaly-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties such as calculable soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms and renormalization group invariant soft terms. However, they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters, leading to tachyonic states.

• The original solution to this problem is to add a universal scalar mass to the AMSB soft SUSY breaking terms, resulting in the ""minimal"" AMSB (mAMSB) model with a parameter space of m0, m3/2, and sign(μ). An alternative setup is hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB), a string-motivated scenario with SUSY breaking localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, where anomaly mediation becomes the dominant source of SUSY breaking in the visible sector.

• The hCAMSB soft SUSY breaking terms are given by m1 = √(14) g1^2 m3/2^2, ma = m3/2 for a = 2, 3, and mi^2 = -14 {gf+g'} m3/2^2, where gf and g' are the beta function for the corresponding superpotential coupling and wave function renormalization constant. The wino and gluino masses receive a contribution from the bino mass at the two-loop level.

• The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if m6 is not too large, due to the presence of chargino candidates in cascade decay events. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.

• The paper aims to characterize the hCAMSB parameter space and sparticle mass spectrum, and derive consequences for the CERN LHC collider, which is expected to begin operation in fall 2009.

- Rapidity gaps, observed in hadronic collisions, are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets.
  - This observation suggests that color singlet exchange effects in QCD events are relevant at high momentum transfers, raising the hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions.
- Bjorken estimated the color-singlet fraction in terms of a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps.
  - The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event, i.e., without soft interactions between the other partons in the scattering hadrons.
- The color-singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons. This results in a decrease of the observable gap fraction as the contribution from gluon-induced dijet events is reduced.
  - Measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations show no such effect, and the D0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum.
- The two-gluon exchange model, used to calculate the color-singlet fraction, demonstrates limitations and requires the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction to be essentially nonperturbative.
  - Within the unitarized model, nonperturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters: the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift.

• LMCX-2 is a Low Mass X-Ray Binary (LMXB) with a neutron star primary and a low mass star secondary.
• The secondary is transferring mass to the primary via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk that produces X-rays.
• LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z source, indicating a high accretion rate.
• The system is one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known, but its X-ray flux is low due to its extra-galactic nature.
• The system parameters of LMCX-2 are not well constrained, with estimates for the orbital period ranging from 6.4 hours to 12 days.
• Recent studies have detected narrow emission lines in the bowen region of other LMXBs, which are thought to arise from the irradiated surface of the donor star.
• The authors apply the technique of bowen fluorescence to LMCX-2 and detect a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset that they identify as the orbital period.
• They also detect narrow emission lines in the bowen region of LMCX-2, which they identify as coming from the irradiated side of the companion.
• These detections provide the first constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2.

• Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z sources and Atoll sources.
• Z sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and trace a Z-like shape in their X-ray color-color diagrams.
• Atoll sources have lower accretion rates and their color-color diagrams usually consist of fragmented island-like regions.
• The main physical difference between Z sources and Atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.

- Axial anomaly and its interpretation:
	+ The axial anomaly is a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, analyzed using renormalization procedure and ultraviolet divergences.
	+ A more formal analysis can be done using the path integral formalism.
	+ Dolgov and Zakharov have shown an alternative approach, interpreting the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon caused by a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram.
- Helicity and the Dolgov-Zakharov approach:
	+ The Dolgov-Zakharov approach is based on the dispersion relation method, expressing the triangular diagram's functions with unsubtracted dispersion relations.
	+ The imaginary part of the invariant scalar functions is derived from the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram, using Cutkosky rules or perturbative unitarity relation.
	+ The complete triangular diagram contribution and the anomalous axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity are derived, finding the same result as the renormalization procedure.
- Mass singularities and the KLN theorem:
	+ Mass singularities appear in the radiative pion decay, and the KLN theorem guarantees their cancellation if the transition probability is summed over the set of degenerate states, order by order in perturbation theory.
	+ The theorem applies to both infrared and collinear singularities, which arise due to the high degeneracy of states in theories with massless particles.
	+ The infrared divergences can be interpreted as the impossibility of distinguishing experimentally a charged particle from one accompanied by soft photons, while collinear singularities correspond to the inability to establish if a massless charged particle is accompanied by collinear photons.

- **Salient Object Detection**
  * Salient object detection is the process of identifying and segmenting the most prominent object in an image or video.
  * It has gained significant attention in the computer vision community due to its potential applications in various fields such as recognition, image and video compression, video summarization, media re-targeting, photo collage, image quality assessment, image segmentation, content-based image retrieval and image collection browsing, image editing and manipulating, visual tracking, object discovery, and human-robot interaction.
  * A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years, which typically involve two steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.

- **Challenges in Salient Object Detection**
  * Current models perform well on scenes with single objects but struggle with complex cluttered scenes with several objects.
  * This is due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets for scaling up models and model development and a widely-agreed objective definition of the most salient object.
  * The paper aims to provide solutions for these problems and discover which component might be the weakest link in the possible failure of models when migrating to complex scenes.

- **Related Topics**
  * Some related topics to visual saliency modeling and salient object detection include object importance, object proposal generation, memorability, scene clutter, image interestingness, video interestingness, surprise, image quality assessment, scene typicality, aesthetic, and attributes.
  * The paper reviews some breakthrough efforts in saliency detection models and discusses some studies that have considered the relationship between fixations and saliency judgments.

• Heegaard Floer theory, constructed by Ozsváth, Szabó, and others, is a decorated topological quantum field theory in dimension 2.
• The theory associates a vector space to a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold with a τ₂-structure, and a map to a connected, oriented four-dimensional cobordism decorated with a τ₂-structure. These maps can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary. For example, two homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 4-manifolds can be obtained by performing a log transform with odd multiplicity on a regular fiber of the nucleus of an elliptic surface. The Heegaard Floer invariants of the cobordisms obtained by deleting a 4-ball from these 4-manifolds are different, which can be shown using the Donaldson or Seiberg-Witten invariants or by comparing the hat Heegaard Floer invariants.

</summary>

The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which are related to the three-manifolds and cobordisms involved via Heegaard diagrams. However, it was shown in [xcite] that every three-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles. Using such a diagram, holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially, and the result is a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any three-manifold as well as of the hat version of Heegaard Floer homology of null homologous knots and links in any three-manifold. A similar result was obtained in [xcite] for all versions of the Heegaard Floer homology of knots and links in the three-sphere.

The goal of this paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps when Ω₂₀ is a cobordism between Ω₆ and Ω₇ with the property that the induced maps",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The main goal in physics is not just to calculate observables but to understand the physical picture behind phenomena
• In crystals, the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field
• However, to understand electric conductivity, heat capacity, etc., it is more effective to work with ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interaction
• This is because the complicated electromagnetic interaction of electrons with ions in the lattice is hidden in the dynamical mass of the electron, and the interactions among ions in the lattice are responsible for collective excitations of the lattice - phonons
• Similarly, in QCD, the theory becomes too complicated at the scale of 1 GeV, making it difficult to determine the relevant physics for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties
• In this lecture, the speaker aims to answer this question by showing that spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important QCD phenomenon for this case
• Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks that interact by the exchange of Goldstone bosons, vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement
• The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry has important consequences, such as the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence (practically massless) quarks

* The text describes a person support apparatus, such as a hospital or long-term care bed, with a patient support deck and a mechanism for adjusting the height and orientation of the deck.
* The deck is supported on a deck support frame, which is supported on leg assemblies pivotally connected at their upper end to the deck support frame.
* Linear actuators are used to pivot the leg assemblies relative to the deck support frame and adjust the height of the deck.
* Known arrangements for pivoting leg assemblies include a guide element moving along the outside of longitudinal elements, which can cause problems such as finger trapping, friction, and dust accumulation.
* The present disclosure describes an alternative arrangement with an inverted U-shaped channel element on one of the sides of the person support frame, and a guide or follower element on the first upper end portion of the leg assembly that runs along the inner surface of the channel element.
* This arrangement results in a robust and stable deck support frame that can accommodate changes in geometry necessary for movement or adjustment between different positions.
* The channel and roller mechanism change the height of the patient support deck by pivoting one or more leg assemblies relative to the under surface of the patient support frame.
* Some illustrative embodiments have a lower part count, are cheaper and more robust, and have the opening of the channel facing the floor to prevent dirt from entering and interfering with the mechanism.
* The leg assembly works vertically within the channel edges, reducing the force necessary to lift the patient support frame, and the guide element inside the channel makes it harder for a patient or care-giver to trap their fingers.
* Additional features and variations of the present disclosure are also described, including a braking mechanism for the castors or castor devices at each of the foot and head ends of the apparatus.

* The invention describes a skin reflectance measuring apparatus for pathology and cosmetology applications.
	+ Skin reflectance can be associated with other parameters such as sebum secretion rate, useful in studying seborrhea and other skin diseases.
	+ In cosmetology, it can measure the effect of anti-reflectance products for greasy skins and grade different types of skins.
* Known methods and devices for surface reflectance measurement in industries are not applicable to skin reflectance measurement.
	+ A problem is the influence of color, which can be overcome by substituting specular reflection measurement with a relative measurement between specular and diffuse reflection.
	+ However, known devices using such relative measurement remain inappropriate for measuring skin reflectance due to the need for accurate positioning and flat surfaces.
* The invention aims to provide a reflectance measurement apparatus specifically adapted for measuring skin reflectance.
	+ The apparatus comprises a probe, a flexible connection in fiber optics, a measuring device, and a display device.
	+ The probe has a casing with an aperture, and the fiber optics connection has three optical conductors facing the aperture in different directions.
	+ The measuring device has light emitting means, light receiving means, processing means, and correcting means for compensating variations in emitted light and ambient light.
* The invention's structure offers several advantages.
	+ The miniaturization of the probe due to fiber optics enables measurements on reduced surfaces, such as between 10 and 50 mm2.
	+ The apparatus is easy to handle, requires no higher accurate positioning, and can tolerate a few degrees of deviation in relative position between the probe and the skin surface.
* The correction of variations in light intensity and ambient light enables accurate measurement without very strict operational conditions.
	+ The means for correcting variations in light intensity can be a circuit for regulating a source of light using servo-control means.
	+ The compensation for the effect of ambient light is achieved by conducting measurements according to the synchronous detection principle.
* The reflectance is a relative value worked out from measurements of specular and diffuse reflection, for example, the difference or the quotient between the measured values.

• The invention is suitable for spontaneously or non-spontaneously breathing subjects, particularly human subjects requiring long-term ventilatory assistance during sleep.
• The invention aims to meet three goals: closely matching the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts, automatically adjusting the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum ventilation, and working correctly in the presence of large leaks.
• Most simple home ventilators fail to meet the goals of closely matching the phase of the subject's spontaneous efforts and adjusting the degree of assistance to maintain at least a given ventilation.
• Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) tailors the pressure vs time profile within a breath to unload the subject's resistive and elastic work, but it has disadvantages such as overestimation of V(t) in the presence of leaks and reliance on the subject's chemoreceptor reflexes.
• The invention discloses a method for calculating the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle as a continuous variable from 0 to 1 revolution.
• The method includes selecting at least two identifiable features of a prototype flow-vs-time waveform, determining the phase and assigning a weight to each feature, defining fuzzy sets for magnitude and rate of change, and setting fuzzy inference rules for each selected feature.
• The method measures leak-corrected respiratory airflow, calculates fuzzy membership in fuzzy sets for each feature, applies fuzzy inference rules to determine the fuzzy extent to which the phase is each feature, and applies a defuzzification procedure to determine the instantaneous phase.
• The invention further discloses methods for calculating instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle with low pass filtering and phase delay correction, measuring the average respiratory rate, and providing ventilatory assistance in a spontaneously breathing subject.
• The invention seeks to achieve partial fulfillment of one or more of the following: matching the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts, automatically adjusting the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum average ventilation, and providing some immunity to the effects of sudden leaks.",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 3, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Design of a downhole vibratory tool:
   • Outer body attached to a stuck object or fish with an upper end.
   • Mandrel within the outer body, connected to the surface through a string.
   • Mandrel has a passage in fluid communication with the passage in the string so that pressure can be delivered from the surface to lateral ports.
   • Ports at different elevations, leading to an annular space with which there is communication to a piston attached to the mandrel.

• Modular piston stack for increased power:
   • Modular piston arrangement allows for as many or as few pistons to be stacked, increasing the area of total pistons exposed to the applied pressure.
   • Stacking pistons in effect increases the delivered power of the tool to considerably more than had been available in prior art tools.

• Annular dump valve and plug system:
   • Mandrel has a lower end that marks the end of passage and a nearby shoulder.
   • A drop in plug is landed on the shoulder to close off the passage so that a wireline or other tool can be run through the passage and into the stuck fish.
   • The plug is preferably retrievable and has a fishing neck and a seal to help close off the passage and build pressure in it.

• Valve operation and pressure buildup:
   • Dump valve is shown closing off a chamber so that application of pressure to the passage will build pressure on the piston to move the mandrel downwardly.
   • The valve is cylindrically shaped with a seal ring initially riding on a surface to hold pressure in the chamber.
   • At some point, the ring seal moves off of the surface, resulting in the loss of sealing contact and the relief of pressure built up in the passage.

• Features of the tool:
   • The ability to stack pistons to increase the available piston area in a confined downhole space.
   • The design of the valve as an annular ring allows for wireline access feature through the passage before the plug is dropped.
   • The valve and the spring are configured to better perform in a cyclical loading environment without fatigue or failure.
   • The tool can be operated with or without jarring blows delivered in every cycle.

* The invention describes a position sensor with a waveform generator and an error correction generator
	+ The waveform generator receives an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer and modifies it based on an error correction signal
	+ The error correction generator determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about the position of an object being sensed
* The error correction generator comprises a comparator, a controller, and a signal processor
	+ The comparator receives the conditioned sensing signal and determines its value
	+ The controller provides first and second timing signals based on the value of the conditioned sensing signal
	+ The signal processor provides the error correction signal based on the timing signals
* A window reference circuit constantly compares a desired conditioned sensor signal output to an existing conditioned sensor signal output and adjusts the conditioned sensor signal output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal
* The sensor monitoring system is remotely located and provides power to the sensor and receives the conditioned sensing signal via two wires
* The sensor can be recalibrated at any time by removing and reapplying power
* The low end of the window is just high enough in value to compensate for any offset in the comparator
* The high end of the window is significantly higher in value than a normal dynamic signal from the differential amplifier when the object or process being monitored increases the output
* The rate of the clock is chosen to be slow enough that a significant number of changes of signal level do not occur during a fast movement of objects being monitored
* The DAC and counter combination contains enough resolution such that even if a sensor offset correction signal is generated, the error correction signal is not a significant portion of the sensor position signal
* The sensor determines and eliminates strong static signals or other error signals that do not deliver information about the position of the object being sensed whose inclusion in the sensor output signal would waste energy

* The invention aims to eliminate the use of springs and provide a kinematic action for closing the valve.
* The invention also aims to control the amount of air/gas mixture entering each piston and close any number of cylinders while the engine is performing with the remaining operational cylinders.
* This is achieved through a reciprocating cam translating device coupled to a rotary cam which receives an input from a pulley driven by a timing belt from an output shaft of an internal combustion engine.
* A second device, under controlled conditions, converts the reciprocating linear motion at the reciprocating cam translating device into a substantially infinitely variable reciprocating motion, which is the valve itself.
* The rotary cam having a grooved track in a circular flat disk displaces a translating means which is a ball constrained in a slide which, in turn, reciprocates in a slot to achieve the first reciprocating linear movement.

* The foil electron multiplier is a new generation design of electron multipliers that uses a series of extremely thin, in-line foils to create secondary electrons and amplify electrons in a series of transmission stages.
* It has several advantages over other types of electron multipliers, including higher gain per multiplication stage, simplicity of fabrication, lower cost of fabrication, ability to cover a larger area, and intrinsic rejection of ion feedback.
* The foil electron multiplier can be used in photomultiplier tubes and particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates, which are used extensively in electron spectrometers, mass spectrometers, and photonic detectors.
* The gain of a foil electron multiplier can be modeled as a series of discrete dynodes and is given by the equation G = TI TGγI [TSE TG [γSE +1]] N−1, where TI is the probability of incident particle transmission through the first foil, TG is the transmission through a supporting grid, γI is the secondary electron emission yield at the first stage, TSE is the probability that a secondary electron successfully transits the second or subsequent stage, and γSE is the secondary electron emission yield at the second or subsequent stage.
* The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, maximizing the transmission through the support grid, and maximizing the secondary electron emission yield at each stage.
* The foil electron multiplier can handle different types of incident particles, including electrons, ions, and photons, and can generate a growing avalanche of electrons that are finally deposited onto the anode.
* The average total gain for incident particles that can transit all foils in the multiplier is given by the equation G = TGN TI γI Σ n=0 N−1 (TSE (γSE +1)) n.
* The gain advantage of the foil electron multiplier over conventional multipliers lies in the term γSE +1, which represents the secondary electron yield from a primary electron exiting a foil and the continuation of the primary electron with the secondary electrons that it generated.

• FAA's primary activities include aviation safety oversight, Air Traffic Control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development. The costs associated with each activity depend on the nature and usage of the specific service FAA provides.

• The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is a multibillion-dollar grant program that provides funding for airports included in FAA’s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems. Unlike safety and ATC services, AIP expenditures are not the direct result of costs imposed by users of the NAS.

• The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA’s two capital accounts, AIP and the Facilities and Equipment account, which funds technological improvements to the ATC system.

• The Trust Fund also provides funding for the Research, Engineering, and Development account, which funds continued research on aviation safety, mobility, and environmental issues. In addition, the Trust Fund supports part of FAA’s operations.

• Superfund Program: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) established the Superfund program in 1980 to clean up the nation's most severely contaminated hazardous waste sites. The program has been extended and reauthorized multiple times, with the latest reauthorization being considered. Under CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigates contaminated areas and places the most highly contaminated sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) for study and cleanup. As of December 1996, there were 1,210 sites on the NPL. After a site is placed on the NPL, EPA extensively studies and evaluates the site to determine the appropriate cleanup remedy for it. The remedy selected depends upon the site's characteristics, such as the types and levels of contamination, the risks posed to human health and the environment, and the applicable cleanup standards. The site's cleanup can be conducted by EPA or the party responsible for the contamination, with oversight by EPA or the state.

• Superfund Incineration: Incineration is the burning of substances by a controlled flame in an enclosed area and is used as a Superfund cleanup remedy. Through fiscal year 1995, EPA had selected incineration as a Superfund cleanup remedy 43 times, or in about 6 percent of the decisions on remedies it had reached through that date. At the time of the review, three incinerators were operating at Superfund sites, and EPA planned to use incineration at four additional sites. Incinerators may be fixed facilities or transportable systems. Fixed facility hazardous waste incinerators are required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) to obtain an operating permit from EPA. RCRA regulates all facets of the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes in the United States. RCRA requires that fixed facility hazardous waste incinerators be operated according to EPA’s regulations and be inspected by EPA every 2 years. Incinerators used to clean Superfund sites are generally “transportable,” that is, they are transported to the site in pieces, assembled,",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

• IRS' audit standards cover various aspects of an audit, including scope, techniques, technical conclusions, reports, time management, and workpaper preparation.
• Audit workpapers are crucial for planning the audit, recording procedures, supporting technical conclusions, and providing a basis for review.
• IRS uses a nine-standard framework to ensure audit quality, with each standard having one or more key elements.
• Workpapers are reviewed during and after audits to ensure compliance with the nine standards, and IRS' Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS) collects information about the audit process, changes, and quality.
• IRS auditors did not always meet the requirements of the workpaper standard, which includes fully disclosing the audit trail, being clear and concise, ensuring tax adjustments agree with IRS forms, adequately documenting the audit activity records, and protecting taxpayers' rights.
• Problems found in IRS audit workpapers include tax adjustments not agreeing in workpapers, summaries, and reports, required documents or summaries not being in the workpaper bundle, and workpapers not being legible or complete.
• IRS has historically found problems with the quality of its workpapers, with auditors meeting all key elements of the workpaper standard in no more than 72% of audits from 1992-1997.
• Workpapers are essential for formulating and documenting auditor findings, conclusions, and recommended adjustments, and inadequate workpapers may result in additional work for the auditor or overturned adjustments.
• IRS' primary quality control mechanism is supervisory review of the audit workpapers, but limited documentation of such reviews was found in the sampled audits.
• IRS is drafting changes to the IRM relating to workpapers, requiring managers to document managerial involvement, which may address the lack of documentation in supervisory reviews.

* **FAA Funding:** FAA is primarily supported by the Trust Fund (82%) and General Fund revenues. The Trust Fund receives revenues from excise taxes on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo shipment. These revenues are available for use subject to appropriations.
* **Trust Fund Revenues:** The Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through dedicated excise taxes. In fiscal year 2005, the ticket tax was the largest single source of Trust Fund revenue, followed by the international departure and arrival tax, the passenger segment tax, and fuel taxes.
* **Administration's Proposal:** The administration's reauthorization proposal would change FAA's financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges. Under the proposed system, funding for ATO would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft.
* **FAA Budget Structure:** The administration's proposal also calls for changing FAA's budget structure by establishing two new budget accounts—Air Traffic Organization and Safety and Operations—to align with FAA’s lines of business and proposed funding.
* **Cost Allocation Study:** FAA released a new cost allocation study in January 2007, which sets forth a methodology for assigning air traffic costs to user groups on the basis of aircraft type. The two principal user groups are the high-performance group and the piston aircraft group.
* **Current Funding Structure:** The current funding structure, with some modifications to the excise taxes and tax rates and changes in the levels of General Fund contributions, has successfully funded a growing FAA budget. However, FAA has been concerned about the long-run revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency of its funding.

	+ IQA consists of two major elements: development of guidelines for ensuring and maximizing quality of information disseminated by federal agencies and establishment of administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies.
	+ IQA builds on previous federal efforts to improve the quality of information, including OMB Circular A-130 and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
	+ OIRA, which oversees the implementation of governmentwide policies in the areas of information technology, privacy, and statistics, had responsibility for developing the governmentwide IQA guidelines.
	+ Agencies' implementation of IQA represented the first time that the executive branch has developed a governmentwide set of information quality guidelines, including agency-specific guidelines tailored to each agency’s unique programs and information.
	+ Agencies' guidelines were to include administrative mechanisms that allow affected parties to request correction of information that they did not consider correct.
- Agencies' Implementation of IQA Guidelines
	+ OMB set up a framework for federal agencies to follow in implementing IQA, including providing assistance and direction to agencies in developing agency IQA guidelines and requiring them to post IQA information on their Web sites.
	+ However, OMB officials and OIRA’s then administrator concentrated their communication and outreach efforts on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies, and OIRA did not clarify for many independent agencies whether the law applied to them or generally follow up with them to help them meet the act’s provisions.

	+ Refugees often arrive in the U.S. after living in refugee camps for years, with little formal education or work experience, or untreated medical or mental health conditions.
	+ Receiving communities may need to adjust their language capabilities and services to respond to the changing needs of diverse refugee populations.
	+ Voluntary agencies may not consult with relevant stakeholders, such as health care providers and schools, when assessing communities' capacity to serve refugees.
	+ Refugees can stretch the resources of local service providers, such as school districts and health care systems.
	+ Refugee students can negatively affect district performance outcomes, and refugees who exhaust federal refugee assistance benefits can strain local safety nets.

- **Secondary Migration and Funding**
	+ Secondary migration, or the movement of refugees from one community to another after initial resettlement, can unexpectedly increase the refugee population in a community.
	+ Communities that attract large numbers of secondary migrants may not have adequate, timely funding to provide resettlement services to the migrants who need them.

- JWST Project Background:
	+ The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large deployable, infrared-optimized space telescope, and the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.
	+ JWST is designed for a 5-year mission to find the first stars and trace the evolution of galaxies, operating at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope.
	+ The project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment.
	+ The observatory segment includes several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler).
	+ The project is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope and collect and transmit data back to Earth.

- JWST Project Status and Challenges:
	+ JWST is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining, but all elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the project's critical path.
	+ The project has used more than 30% of its schedule reserve established at the time of the replan in 2011 to address technical challenges.
	+ The project has identified and maintains a list of 102 risks that need to be tested and mitigated to an acceptable level in the next 3 years.
	+ The project has experienced significant increases to project costs and schedule delays, with early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low level cost reserves, and poorly phased funding levels contributing to these overruns.

• The report considers both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles), and prospects for improving occupant safety.

• The report is one of three GAO reports examining automobile safety, alongside Highway Safety: Factors Affecting Involvement in Vehicle Crashes and Highway Safety: Reliability and Validity of DOT Crash Tests.

• Since the mid-1960s, both the number of traffic fatalities and the fatality rate per registered vehicle have decreased in the United States, with a 36% decline in the automobile occupant fatality rate since 1975.

• • Factors contributing to this favorable trend include reduced drunk driving, increased safety belt use, and the introduction of antilock brakes, air bags, and other safety enhancing features.

• In 1991, automobiles were associated with nearly 29,000 traffic deaths in the United States, with approximately 22,000 automobile-related fatalities being automobile occupants.

• • Of these, about 10,000 were killed in single-car collisions and 12,000 in multiple-vehicle collisions.

• **Tobacco production and pesticide use**

	+ Tobacco is a high-value, pesticide-intensive crop, ranking ninth in the nation's crop value and sixth in pesticide application per acre.
	+ Two-thirds of domestic tobacco is produced in Kentucky and North Carolina, while it is grown in over 100 countries.
	+ The United States was the world's leading exporter of unmanufactured tobacco until 2001, when it ranked third behind Brazil and Zimbabwe.
	+ Most tobacco grown in the United States is used for cigarette manufacturing, with over 90% used for this purpose worldwide.

• **Pesticide regulation and health risks**

	+ Pesticides play a significant role in increasing crop production but can pose health risks to humans.
	+ The dose and toxicity of a chemical, as well as an individual's age and health status, can affect the potential for harm.
	+ Residue levels on crops depend on factors such as the amount and timing of pesticide application, and where it is applied.
	+ Federal requirements for pesticide registration, sale, and use are primarily governed by FIFRA, FFDCA, and FQPA.

• **Reregistration and tolerance reassessment**

	+ Older pesticides must be reregistered to ensure they meet contemporary health and safety standards.
	+ FQPA amendments require EPA to reevaluate pesticide residue tolerances to ensure a reasonable certainty of no harm, with an additional 10-fold safety factor for children.
	+ EPA must also consider aggregate exposure and cumulative effects of pesticides with a common mechanism of toxicity.

• **Risk assessment and exposure**

	+ EPA uses risk assessment to evaluate potential health impacts of pesticides and determine mitigation measures.
	+ Exposure to pesticides can occur through residues on crops, inhalation, or dermal contact.
	+ EPA calculates reference doses or concentrations, or margins of exposure, to determine safe levels of exposure.
	+ Evaluating and managing risk involves determining the maximum safe level of exposure and assessing whether actual exposure is below this level.

• Fiscal constraints require agencies to distinguish wants from needs to ensure the best return on investment:
	• Agency budgets may not align with strategic goals or consider resource limitations.
	• Agencies often prioritize individual needs over collective needs.
	• Program and funding decisions may undermine sound policies.
	• Congressional directions can result in unplanned purchases.

• Incremental budgeting and resource allocation practices can hinder strategic planning:
	• DOD and EPA have historically based resource allocations on precedents rather than broader goals.
	• IT investment management models lack full implementation of portfolio selection criteria.

• Effective investment management is crucial for ensuring strategic needs:
	• DHS lacks key investment management elements, leading to incomplete institutional capability.
	• Commercial companies successfully adjust resource allocations based on market changes.

• Fragmented decision-making processes and individualized needs assessments can negatively impact operations:
	• DOD allows separate needs assessments for organizational units, reducing assurance in investment decisions.
	• Agencies may invest in wants rather than true needs, wasting resources.

• Agencies must translate needs into appropriate programs, set realistic system requirements, and maintain stability:
	• Overpromising and underdelivering in major system acquisitions is common.
	• Requirements instability can cause delays, cost growth, and reduced contractor accountability.

• Programs often face challenges in developing requisite knowledge and proceeding through key knowledge points:
	• DOD weapon acquisitions often take longer, cost more, and deliver different capabilities than planned.
	• Other agencies lack adequate knowledge before proceeding with development.

• Contract management challenges require re-examination of contractor usage and improved oversight:
	• Contracts often lack definitive requirements, realistic complexity assessments, and appropriate risk allocation.
	• Incentive and award fees may not be tied to desired program outcomes.
	• Time-and-materials contracts, interagency contracting, and undefinitized contract actions can carry risk and waste taxpayer dollars.

• Rationale for Reserve Banks' stock purchase requirement and 6% dividend:
	• Historical rationale: The stock purchase requirement and 6% dividend were established to balance power between the Board of Governors and private interests, capitalize the Reserve Banks, and help support the new national currency created by the act.
	• Legislative history and historical accounts suggest that the dividend rate of 6% was intended to compensate member banks for the requirement to provide funds to the Reserve Banks to begin operations and the risk of the Federal Reserve not succeeding, as well as to attract state-chartered banks to the Federal Reserve.

• Potential implications of modifying the Reserve Bank stock ownership requirement for member banks:
	• Scenario 1 - Permanently retiring Reserve Bank stock and eliminating the stock ownership requirement: This could change the existing corporate structure of the Reserve Banks, disrupt the Federal Reserve's public and private balance, and have implications for the autonomy of the Reserve Banks, the independence of the Federal Reserve, and the operations of the Reserve Banks.
	• Scenario 2 - Making ownership of Reserve Bank stock voluntary for member banks: This could lead to concentration of stock ownership and voting rights, and a need for more resources to plan for and manage increased fluctuations in paid-in capital.
	• Scenario 3 - Modifying the capital requirement associated with the stock to allow member banks to hold the entire 6% capital contribution as callable capital: This would eliminate the dividend payment to member banks, and could cause public perception problems and exacerbate financial distress in stressful economic times.

• The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing Congress's authority to proscribe hate crimes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation.
• The commerce clause allows Congress to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, as well as those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.
• The Supreme Court decision in Morrison narrowed the ""affects interstate commerce"" category and limited Congress's authority to regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on its aggregate effect on interstate commerce.
• Hate crimes that involve interstate travel continue to be within the commerce clause's reach, but attempts to broaden the scope of hate crime legislation tied to findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes under the commerce clause are constitutionally suspect.
• The legislative clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments give Congress the power to enforce the Amendments by appropriate legislation, and Section 2 of the 13th Amendment may be a more viable option for broadening hate crime legislation.

- **Role and responsibilities of U.S. Chiefs of Mission (COM)**
	+ COMs are the principal officers in charge of each U.S. diplomatic mission to a foreign country, foreign territory, or international organization.
	+ They are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and serve as the President's personal representative in the country of assignment.
	+ COMs have full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of all Government executive branch employees in their country of assignment, with the primary exception of military operations.
	+ They exercise this authority through their leadership of the embassy's ""country team,"" which includes the chief representative of each U.S. government agency undertaking activities in the host country.

- **Sources of COM legal authority**
	+ COM authority is primarily explained in the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (FSA 1980).
	+ It is also shaped by executive branch directives, including executive orders, presidential directives, and State Department regulations.
	+ The President's letter of instruction to each COM provides greater detail on a COM's authority and is of greater significance in determining a COM's authority than the pertinent legislative provisions.

- **Congressional concerns regarding COM authority**
	+ Congress has a part in selecting U.S. ambassadors, providing the resources they need, and overseeing their conduct of missions.
	+ Congress is interested in how effective COM authority is in practice and how it might be improved.

* **Establishment and Purpose of ASEAN:**
	+ ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967, with the adoption of the ASEAN Declaration in Bangkok, Thailand.
	+ The association was created to achieve joint goals including those related to economic growth, regional peace and security, collaboration and mutual assistance in development areas, trade promotion, and linkages with other regional organizations.
* **ASEAN Secretariat:**
	+ The ASEAN Secretariat was created in 1976 to serve as an administrative body consisting of representatives of each ASEAN member nation.
	+ The Secretariat is headed by a secretary-general, who serves a term of five years, and is currently responsible for organizing the annual foreign ministers' meeting, initiating, advising, coordinating, and implementing ASEAN activities, serving as spokesman and representative of ASEAN, and overseeing the operations of the ASEAN Secretariat.
* **Principles and Challenges of ASEAN:**
	+ ASEAN operates on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, which has led to difficulty in the group operating in formal concert.
	+ The expansion of ASEAN to include underdeveloped nations such as Laos, Cambodia, and Burma has created a wide range of interests within the group that make formal security and economic moves difficult to agree upon.
* **ASEAN Charter:**
	+ A new ASEAN Charter went into effect on December 15, 2007, superseding the ASEAN Declaration as the organizing document for the organization.
	+ The charter is effectively a constitution for ASEAN, committing the member nations to the formation of an ""ASEAN Community in furtherance of peace, progress and prosperity of its peoples.""
* **U.S.-ASEAN Relations:**
	+ The United States has long had close bilateral relations with many of Southeast Asia's nations.

	• They are used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products.
	• In 2009, low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes renewed interest in imposing new import barriers on MPCs.
	• Advocates argue that stricter import controls would encourage the use of domestically produced protein and raise milk prices for dairy farmers, while opponents claim it would increase costs and result in higher retail food prices.

• **MPCs imports and trade restrictions:**
	• Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions, while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas.
	• Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market include New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union.
	• Concerns about MPC imports have been raised periodically since import levels rose sharply in the late 1990s.
	• In 2009, MPC imports dropped off significantly and have since remained at or below peak levels reached in 2000.

• **Milk composition and protein types:**
	• Milk is mostly water (87.4%), and the remaining 12.6% is called ""milk solids.""
	• Milk solids are split into four components: fat (3.7%), protein (3.4%), lactose or sugar (4.8%), and minerals (0.7%).
	• Milk protein is of two basic types: casein (2.8% of total weight) and whey protein (0.6% of total weight).
	• Casein is extracted from milk by injecting a certain enzyme or acid into skim milk, while whey protein is found in liquid whey, a by-product of cheese manufacturing.

• **Functionality and applications of MPCs:**
	• MPCs have various functional characteristics, such as solubility, viscosity, water-binding, whipping and foaming, gelling, and heat stability.

* HRPs also help states comply with HIPAA portability and guaranteed availability provisions, and enroll a small percentage of the uninsured, primarily those with preexisting conditions seeking coverage in the private, non-group market.
* The private health insurance market mainly serves individuals through the group market, while some individuals seek coverage in the nongroup market and undergo rigorous medical underwriting.
* HRPs were designed to assist individuals with moderate to severe health conditions who have few options for private health coverage, and appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion.
* However, HRPs have been criticized for being too small and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of uninsured individuals with costly medical conditions.
* Consumer groups generally advocate for expansion of the federal role in providing coverage, whether through existing public programs or broader health care reform.

- **Creation and Management of CRAF:** The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) was created by President Truman in 1951 to meet the nation's airlift needs in times of crisis. It is currently managed by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). CRAF supports DOD airlift requirements in emergencies when the need for airlift exceeds the capacity of DOD's organic airlift fleet.
- **CRAF Participation and Activation:** To participate in CRAF, a carrier must commit at least 30% of its CRAF-capable passenger fleet and 15% of its CRAF-capable cargo fleet. Aircraft committed must be U.S. registered and air carriers must also commit and maintain at least four complete crews for each aircraft in CRAF. CRAF has three main segments: international, national, and aeromedical evacuation. The international segment is further divided into the long-range and short-range sections, while the national segment is divided into the domestic and Alaskan sections. Assignment of aircraft to a segment depends on the nature of the requirement and the aircraft performance characteristics needed. The long-range international section consists of commercial airliners capable of transoceanic operations. Medium-sized passenger and cargo aircraft make up the short-range international section supporting near offshore airlift requirements. The aircraft in the Alaskan section provide airlift within U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility, specific to Alaska needs. The domestic section is designed to satisfy increased DOD airlift requirements in the United States during an emergency.

- The Clause has been interpreted as preventing the President from simply disregarding or suspending laws enacted by Congress, and imposing a ""duty"" or ""obligation"" upon the President to ensure that executive branch officials obey Congress's commands.
- The Supreme Court has established that when an executive officer fails to perform a ""specific duty [] assigned by law,"" the courts may enforce the obligation through a writ of mandamus.
- The President's legislative role comes to an end once a bill is enacted into law, and is supplanted by his express constitutional obligation under Article II, §3 to ""take Care that the Law[] be faithfully executed.""
- The executive branch has acknowledged that it has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend the enforcement of the laws, particularly of statutes.
- The Take Care Clause makes a significant contribution to the separation of powers by operating as a clear demarcation of the legitimate powers and responsibilities of both the President and Congress in our constitutional system.
- The President and his subordinates may not create law by unilaterally disregarding, amending, or repealing a validly enacted statute, as the ultimate power to legislate is possessed solely by Congress.

	+ The official U.S. poverty rate in 2013 was 14.5%, a statistically significant drop from 15.0% in 2012.
	+ The poverty rate tends to follow the economic cycle, with higher rates during recessions and lower rates during economic growth.
	+ The poverty rate reached a historic low of 11.3% in 2000 but increased during the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions.
	+ The most recent recession, which ended in June 2009, was the longest recorded post-World War II period, leading to higher unemployment rates and increased poverty.

- **Poverty Rate by Age and Family Composition**
	+ In 2013, the poverty rate for non-aged adults (18-64) was 13.6%, and the rate for children (under 18) was 19.5%.
	+ The poverty rate for adults aged 65 and over was 9.5%, much lower than the SPM measure of 14.6%.
	+ The SPM expands the economic unit for poverty measurement, including cohabiting partners, unmarried co-residing parents, and their relatives.
	+ This expansion results in 27.953 million additional persons being classified as part of an economic unit, reducing poverty under the SPM measure.

Farm bills, renewed every five or six years, can lock in policy behavior for an extended period, affecting future multilateral negotiations.
	+ *Domestic support outlays and AoA classifications:* The most recent U.S. notification to the WTO of domestic support outlays is for the 2012 crop year, governed by the 2008 farm bill. The AoA sets country-specific aggregate spending limits on the most market-distorting policies and categorizes agricultural domestic support programs according to their potential to distort commercial markets.
	+ *WTO agreements and farm policy design:* WTO agreements like the AoA and SCM shape U.S. agricultural policy choices. Designing farm programs that comply with WTO rules can avoid potential trade disputes, as policies found to be in violation of WTO rules may be subject to challenge and require alteration or amendment by Congress.

- **AoA Categories and Compliance**

- **Constitutional and legal challenges to redistricting**: Court challenges to redistricting plans were historically considered non-justiciable political questions. However, in the landmark ruling of Baker v. Carr (1962), the Supreme Court held that a constitutional challenge to a redistricting plan was not a political question and was justiciable. Since then, a series of constitutional and legal challenges have significantly shaped how congressional districts are drawn. Recent and pending Supreme Court cases will likely continue to impact the process of congressional redistricting and the success of challenges to redistricting plans.
- **Key constitutional and federal statutory requirements**: The Elections Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 4, clause 1, provides that the times, places, and manner of holding congressional elections be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof, but that Congress may at any time make or alter such laws. Article I, Section 2, clause 3 requires a count of the U.S. population every 10 years, and based on the census, requires apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives among the states, with each state entitled to at least one Representative. A federal statute requires that apportionment occur every 10 years. In order to comport with the constitutional standard of equality of population among districts, most states are required to draw new boundaries for its congressional districts. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to require that each congressional district within a state contain approximately the same population, known as the ""equality standard"" or the principle of ""one person, one vote.""

• *Wildfire Preparedness Appropriations*: Provide funding for fire prevention and detection as well as for equipment, training, and baseline personnel. 

• *Wildfire Suppression Appropriations*: Fluctuate widely over the past decade, from less than $430 million in FY1999 to $2.41 billion in FY2008. 

• **Protection of Non-Federal Lands**: This category addresses protection of non-federal lands through programs to assist state and local governments and communities. 

• *Assistance Programs*: Can be used by the state and local governments to reduce wildland fuels, to otherwise prepare for fire control, to contain and control wildfires, and to respond after severe wildfires have burned. 

• **Other Fire-Related Expenditures**: This category supports fire research, fire facilities, and improvements in forest health.

• **Social Security Coverage for State and Local Government Employees**

• **Current Law**: Under current law, most state and local government employees are covered by Social Security. However, about 27.5% of these employees (around 6.6 million persons) are not covered. Coverage rates vary across states, and Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory for most state and local government employees hired after July 1991.

• **Section 218 Agreements**: Social Security coverage for state and local government employees is extended through Section 218 Agreements between a state and the Social Security Administration. These agreements detail which state and local government positions are covered by Social Security and Medicare. Each state has a State Social Security Administrator responsible for administering, preparing modifications for, and monitoring coverage of subdivisions under the state's Section 218 Agreement.

• **Potential Advantages and Disadvantages**: Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees have been discussed for many years. Mandating coverage could have various advantages and disadvantages, including financial implications for the Social Security system, benefit protections for workers and their families, impacts on states and localities with existing pension systems, and broader social considerations.

• **Financial Status of Social Security**: The Social Security system is projected to face long-term financial challenges. Expenditures are expected to exceed income by 16% on average over the next 75 years, and trust fund assets are projected to be exhausted by 2036. Mandating Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees could help alleviate some of these financial pressures.

Enrollees are responsible for premiums, and there are no preexisting condition exclusions but waiting periods for orthodontia.
	+ Four nationwide dental plans are available, with monthly premiums ranging from $22.71 to $37.90 for self-only coverage in Washington, D.C. Waiting periods for orthodontia vary by plan, and all plans have an annual benefit limit of $1,200 for Class A through C services.
	+ Three vision plans are available, each with high and standard options. Annual self-only premiums range from $71.76 to $103.20. Covered services include eye exams, lenses, and frames according to a schedule, with some low vision coverage.
- When considering FEDVIP enrollment, individuals should weigh the coverage in their FEHB plan, likelihood of using services, and potential benefits against premium costs. FEDVIP plans serve as secondary payers to FEHB plans, and employees may also contribute to a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) for additional coverage.

• The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (LMR) requires meat packers to report prices and other information on purchases of cattle, hogs, lamb, boxed beef, wholesale pork, and lamb carcasses to the USDA.
&tab;• LMR was set to expire on September 30, 2015, but was reauthorized until September 30, 2020, by the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015.
&tab;• Before LMR, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information on a voluntary basis.
&tab;• The livestock industry underwent significant changes in the 1990s, including increased concentration, more production specialization, and vertical integration, leading to a call for mandatory price reporting.

• Opponents of mandatory price reporting argued that it would impose costly new burdens and could cause the release of confidential company information.
&tab;• However, some opponents decided to support a mandatory price reporting law due to low prices and the potential for an emerging ""patchwork"" of state price reporting laws.
&tab;• LMR was enacted in 1999, mandating price reporting for live cattle, boxed beef, and live swine, and allowing USDA to establish mandatory price reporting for lamb sales.
&tab;• The LMR statute initially made lamb reporting optional, but USDA established mandatory reporting for lamb in the final rule.

• The implementation of mandatory reporting did not affect the continuation of the AMS voluntary price-reporting program.

* Protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have improved, enabling qualitative and quantitative proteome comparisons.
	+ Current ion trap mass spectrometers are sensitive and have fast analysis times, identifying hundreds of proteins in a single LC-MS/MS analysis.
* However, obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from complex samples remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present over wide concentration ranges.
	+ Samples are typically fractionated at the protein or peptide level to improve proteome coverage.
* Undersampling occurs when the complexity of tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer, resulting in variable protein identifications.
	+ Repetitive LC-MS/MS analyses and other strategies can increase protein identifications and improve reproducibility.
* A study compares the effects of two commonly used strategies, gelc-MS/MS with repetitive LC-MS/MS analysis and additional protein prefractionation, on depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates.
	+ Both strategies increase protein identifications and reproducibility, but the most time- and resource-effective strategy should be determined.
* The 3-d method, which includes microsol IEF prior to SDS-page separation, substantially improves proteome coverage compared with repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method.
	+ The study uses a cell extract of the human metastatic melanoma cell line 1205lu and keeps other factors uniform to demonstrate the relative effects of repetitive analyses versus an additional prefractionation step at the protein level.
* Microsol IEF was developed to prefractionate complex proteomes prior to narrow pH range 2-d gels and has been used prior to 1-d SDS-page as part of a 4-d strategy for fractionating serum or plasma.
	+ In this study, microsol IEF is evaluated for prefractionating cell lysates prior to gelc-MS/MS, as it is orthogonal to SDS-page and does not suffer from many of the limitations of 2-d gels.

• Comparison of postoperative bleeding between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy (SMUPPP):
- A retrospective study of 404 patients who underwent tonsillectomy or SMUPPP between 2001 and 2010 was conducted.
- The incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was significantly higher in the tonsillectomy group (5.05%) compared to the SMUPPP group (1.45%).

• Factors affecting postoperative bleeding:
- The study found that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP decreased the incidence of postoperative bleeding.
- Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence.

• Incidence of postoperative bleeding in the literature:
- The postoperative bleeding rate of the tonsillectomy group was similar to the rates mentioned in the literature (1.5%-18.0%, commonly between 3.0% and 5.0%).
- Rates of hemorrhage after SMUPPP have not been studied as extensively as those after tonsillectomy, but the bleeding rate after SMUPPP in this study was 1.45%, which falls within the range (0.6% to 14.0%) found in the literature.

• The presence of Candida albicans, a type of fungus, is associated with some failures in root canal treatments.

- This fungus is dentinophilic, meaning it has a tendency to invade dentin, and can remain in the root canal system due to its ability to survive without nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials.

• The study compares the antifungal properties of two root-end filling materials, ProRoot MTA and MTA-Angelus, against Candida albicans.

- Both materials were fungicidal for Candida albicans at both concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml, and in both fresh and set states after 24 hours.

- However, there was no significant difference between the two materials in their antifungal properties (p<0.05).

• The study also highlights the importance of testing root-end filling materials in both freshly mixed and set states, as the perceived difference in antifungal patterns of the materials may be a result of the differences in the degree of setting.

• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-MET:
- HCC is the sixth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
- The burden of HCC disproportionately affects developing countries and males, with 85% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia in 2008.
- Risk factors for HCC development include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens such as aflatoxin B, and genetic metabolic diseases.
- HGF is secreted primarily by mesenchymal cells and circulates as an inactive single-chain precursor, which is converted into an active two-polypeptide chain heterodimeric linked by a disulfide bond by extracellular proteases.
- HGF is a ligand for the c-MET receptor, which is expressed predominantly on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells of many organs, including the liver.
- HGF-c-MET signaling is critical for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair after acute injury, but is also implicated in cellular invasion and metastases.

• Molecular pathogenesis of HCC and the role of the HGF-c-MET pathway:
- HCC development is a complex multistep process driven by accumulation of heterogeneous molecular alterations from initial hepatocyte injury to metastatic invasion.
- Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades necessary for proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and survival.

• Study details:
•- Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who underwent liver resections for colorectal liver metastases from 1992 to 2004
•- Aim: Determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection by identifying predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of colorectal liver metastases (sCLM)

• sCLM treatment:
•- Hepatic resection is the best treatment with 5-year survival rates between 23% and 37%
•- Resections of both primary colorectal lesion and hepatic metastases are needed for sCLM when resectable
•- Simultaneous resection of primary and liver tumors is a favorable strategy, but associated with high morbidity rates due to greater surgical stress and longer operation time
•- Staged resection is an alternative strategy to avoid excessive surgical stress

• Postoperative complications:
•- Anastomotic leakage was defined as peritonitis, dehiscence in the anastomosis, discharge of pus from the anus, vaginal fistula, or feces from the abdominal drain
•- Correlations between postoperative morbidity and patient, tumor, and surgical factors were analyzed

• Predictive factors for anastomotic leakage:
•- Multivariate analyses revealed operation time greater than 8 hours as the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM
•- Extent of hepatectomy, timing of anastomosis and hepatectomy, and usage of pringle maneuver did not correlate with occurrence of complication or anastomotic leakage

• Conclusion:
•- Staged resections should be selected to prevent anastomotic leakage or serious complications when the scheduled operation would result in considerable surgical stress (predicted operation time greater than 8 hours)

• The antimicrobial sensitivity of a target strain to any given bacteriocin may depend on environmental conditions, such as salt concentration, pH, membrane disrupting molecules, inducing cultures, and other factors.
• Gram-positive bacteriocins are classified into four classes, including class I or lantibiotics, class II, class III, and class IV.
• Many Enterococcus strains produce bacteriocins that exhibit high activities against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
• Enterocin S37 is a bacteriocin produced by E. faecalis recently isolated from chicken feces, which exhibits activity against L. monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni.
• The activity of Enterocin S37 increased several folds during the purification process, and it is sensitive to proteases, stable at different pH and high temperatures, and has a molecular weight of less than 10 kDa.
• Combinations of Enterocin S37 and different K channel modulators suggested an implication of Enterocin S37 in a depletion of intracellular K level, by an action on Katp channels rather than Kv channels.

* Treatment of onychomycosis with tazarotene:
	+ Tazarotene is a topical drug used for nail psoriasis and acne, with immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties.
	+ A study investigated the effect of tazarotene on distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis in an open preliminary trial of immunocompetent patients.
	+ The results showed that topical tazarotene (0.1% gel) applied once a day for 12 weeks improved onychomycosis symptoms and restored nail growth and tropism.
	+ No side effects were reported except for mild erythema on the perionychia in two patients.

* Efficacy of tazarotene against fungal growth:
	+ Mycological cultures and potassium hydroxide stains were performed on nail samples taken at the baseline and at the end point.
	+ The results showed that tazarotene inhibited the growth of t. mentagrophytes, c. albicans, c. glabrata, and t. verrucosum in vitro.

* Immunological profile of the nail apparatus:
	+ The nail apparatus has a different immunological profile compared to the normal skin.
	+ It has a strong innate immunity and increased expression of antimicrobial peptides, but a lower level of major histocompatibility complex class-1a antigen expression, production of immunosuppressive agents, anomalies of antigen-presenting cells, and inhibition of natural killer cell activity.

* Topical treatment of nail onychomycosis:
	+ Successful topical treatment of nail onychomycosis is difficult due to slow nail growth, the physical presence of the nail plate interfering with nail bed access, and the difficulty in finding compounds with adequate pharmacologic profile for nail penetration.
	+ The most frequently used topical therapies for onychomycosis are amorolfine 5%, ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, and tioconazole 28% solution, which need to be applied for prolonged periods and require strong adherence by the patients.

• Myosin VA (Myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
- Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of N-terminal motor domains (i.e., heads) connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular C-terminal cargo-binding domain.
- Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis.
- The motion is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in the motor's processive motion as each head takes 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.

• Utilizing tethered particle microscopy (TPM), the flexural stiffness of individual Myova motors and their subdomains was directly measured.
- TPM has been used extensively to characterize the contour length of DNA tethers.
- The motion of tethered quantum dots (Qdots) was measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered Qdot to a stationary, reference Qdot.
- By attaching Qdots to expressed Myova constructs of different lengths, the contributions of individual structural domains to the overall flexibility and flexural stiffness of the Myova molecule were isolated.

• Surrogate variables:
	- Percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT).
	- Granulation tissue covering the wound area (at 2nd week or EOT) was also considered.

• Key findings:
	- The granulation tissue covering > 75% of the ulcer area at the EOT was the most efficient predictor of complete healing (79.5% correct classification, high negative predictive value).
	- An earlier evaluation of this surrogate marker (granulation tissue covering > 50% of the ulcer area at 2 weeks) was also adequate.

* Digital mammography (DM) is now widely used in the US, with lower radiation dose and higher sensitivity compared to screen-film mammography
	+ DM is less likely to be damaged and has slightly higher sensitivity than screen-film mammography
	+ However, DM still has limitations in detecting breast cancers in dense breast tissue
* Tomosynthesis, also known as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), is a 3-D mammography technique that addresses the limitation of DM
	+ DBT creates image slices of a tissue volume, decreasing the problem of confusing overlapping tissue
	+ DBT radiation exposure is approximately the same as that of sfm or DM
* Adding DBT to standard mammography increases mammogram accuracy and decreases recall rates
	+ DBT can more clearly depict benign findings than routine screening views, reducing the need for recall for additional imaging
	+ The additional cancers detected by DBT are invasive malignancies missed by conventional mammography
* Synthetically reconstructed 2-D images can be made from DBT data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing radiation dose
	+ This would make the dose for DBT similar to that of conventional mammography
	+ The use of DBT doubles the radiation dose in screening, but it has been considered necessary for detection and characterization of calcifications
* Longer interpretation times and higher cost are the current limitations of DBT
	+ However, compared with breast magnetic resonance imaging, DBT is a relatively low-cost innovation
	+ Further technological changes and clinical research trials are underway to evaluate the true performance of DBT
* Contrast-enhanced DBT has shown promising results in detecting mammographically occult cancers in dense breast tissue
	+ This technique may be particularly useful in patients with dense breast tissue
	+ The potential advantages over MRI include shorter examination time, ability to perform this exam at the same time as DM, and preoperative guidance for biopsy if only seen with mammography
* Optimizing imaging parameters and decreasing radiation exposure are ongoing in DM and DBT

• Capsaicin cough challenge testing used to measure cough reflex sensitivity
• Diphenhydramine-containing formulation proved more effective than dextromethorphan in suppressing cough reflex sensitivity
• Further clinical trials needed to evaluate OTC cough and cold products

• Diphenhydramine is classified as an antitussive (cough suppressant) by the FDA and is a component of numerous OTC cough and cold preparations
• However, this study is the first to demonstrate the ability of this agent to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in acute pathological cough
• Capsaicin cough challenge testing involves inhaling single, vital-capacity breaths of ascending concentrations of capsaicin solution until 5 or more coughs result in the 15 seconds following an inhalation
• The end point of capsaicin challenge testing is the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C5)
• Cough reflex sensitivity was significantly inhibited (log C5 increased) after diphenhydramine (p < 0.01)

• Dextromethorphan, also available since the 1950s, is the most commonly used OTC antitussive in the United States and many other areas of the world

- Aims of surgery include decompression of neural components, fracture reduction, and stable fixation until arthrodesis is achieved.
- Transpedicular short-segment fixation has become popular, with pedicle screw fixation one vertebra above and one below the fracture.
- Short-segment spinal instrumentation offers benefits such as better correction of kyphotic deformity, greater initial stability, early painless mobilization, and indirect decompression of the spinal canal.

• The use of intermediate screws in short-segment fixation has been studied for fracture reduction and kyphosis correction.
- Biomechanical and clinical studies suggest improved biomechanical stability with monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws inserted at the level of fractured vertebrae.
- Design and implantation techniques of pedicle screw systems have been modified to reduce pedicle screw breakage and facilitate connecting rod application.
- Polyaxial head coupling has been found to reduce compression bending strength at the screw-rod mount, compared to monoaxial screw designs.

• A calf experimental model was used to compare the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws placed at the level of fracture.

• The treatment costs for cholelithiasis are over $5 billion per year in the US, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy being more cost-effective due to reduced disability and income loss.
• However, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy, which is surprising since open cholecystectomy requires more resources and has a longer recovery time.
• A study of 70 cholecystectomy patients found that the average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, while open cholecystectomies cost an average of $13,042.
• Decision tree analysis showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective than laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but if charges could be reduced to certain levels, laparoscopic cholecystectomy could become cost-effective.
• Reusable instruments and advanced laparoscopic skills could help reduce the charge for laparoscopy and make laparoscopic cholecystectomy more cost-effective.
• Managed care contractors prefer open cholecystectomy for all patients with cholecystitis, but most patients would not enroll in a health plan or go to a hospital that does not provide laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
• Sensitivity analysis shows that if the conversion rate equals 5%, a charge of less than $12,679.90 would be needed to make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective.
• Health care payers should evaluate charge data for each hospital before contracting for medical services, especially for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is in high demand.

* Biological scaffold materials derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa of human, bovine, and porcine origin have been used in soft tissue repair applications.
	+ These scaffolds are useful in contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria.
* Early designs of absorbable polymer scaffolds include Dexon and Vicryl, which are comprised of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and a copolymer of glycolide and lactide, respectively.
	+ Dexon degrades in vivo via hydrolysis and is fully resorbed in approximately 60-90 days, while Vicryl loses 77% of its strength in the first 14 days and is fully resorbed in approximately 60-90 days.
* Both Dexon and Vicryl scaffolds lose mechanical strength and are resorbed fairly quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications.
	+ More recent absorbable scaffold designs utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly.
* Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh are examples of newer absorbable scaffolds that degrade in vivo through both hydrolytic and enzymatic mechanisms.
	+ These scaffolds have been evaluated in animal studies and clinical trials for various surgical applications, with promising outcomes.
* Phasix Mesh is a fully resorbable polymer monofilament that is knitted into a flat sheet configuration, while the P4HB plug is preformed into a three-dimensional shape.
	+ Both have been evaluated in a porcine model to determine their mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics when utilized to bridge a surgical defect.
* Mechanical testing revealed that the burst strength and relative stiffness of the Phasix Mesh and P4HB plug repaired sites were similar to each other at all time points evaluated.
	+ Sites repaired with these materials also exhibited significantly greater burst strength and relative stiffness compared to the native abdominal wall.
* Gel permeation chromatography was conducted to quantify the molecular weight of the P4HB material remaining at the repair",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_subpoints': 1, 'symbol': '*'}"

* Acoustic rhinometry is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry by analyzing reflected acoustic impulses
* In a study of healthy Iranian volunteers who underwent cosmetic rhinoplasty, acoustic rhinometry was used to evaluate changes in nasal dimensions before and after surgery
* The study found that the minimum cross-sectional area (MCA) and volume of the nasal cavity decreased significantly after surgery, while the distance to the minimum cross-sectional areas (d1 and d2) did not change significantly
* The study also found that patients who underwent rhinoplasty plus septoplasty experienced more increase in MCA1 and less constriction in MCA2 postoperatively compared to patients who underwent rhinoplasty alone
* Placing a columellar strut in patients who underwent rhinoplasty plus septoplasty had a significant effect on MCA1 and MCA2 levels, while in patients who underwent rhinoplasty alone, placing a columellar strut caused a greater amount of increase in MCA1
* Regression analysis revealed no fixed significant effect for septoplasty, osteotomy, and placing a columellar strut on the difference after surgery in MCA1, MCA2, and v

• Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many developed nations, accounting for 30% of all deaths, with its incidence still increasing.
• Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of CVD risk factors, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
• N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have beneficial effects on CVD, with lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic properties.
• Low-grade chronic inflammation is a prominent process in atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease development, and n-3 PUFAs can modulate this inflammatory response.
• There are two main types of PUFAs: omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, with different locations of the last double bond. The human body can produce all fatty acids except for linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which are essential fatty acids.
• The conversion of ALA to longer-chain n-3 PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA, is limited in humans, making dietary intake crucial for maintaining tissue and circulating EPAs and DHAs.
• Fish is the primary food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs, while ALA is mainly found in seeds, nuts, and their oils. Different sources of n-3 PUFAs may have specific effects on cardiovascular risk markers.
• In atherosclerosis, endothelial cells' balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules is disrupted, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and further progression of the disease.
• N-3 PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives can modulate the inflammatory response, and a balanced intake of ALA and LA or their longer-chain products is required for optimal cardiovascular health.

- **Immunotherapy approaches for cancer treatment:**
  * Many new immunotherapy approaches have entered clinical development in the last two decades due to the increased understanding of the immune system's mechanisms.
  * Some agents have been approved for standard clinical use, such as infusional cytokine therapies, intravesical BCG therapy, and an active cellular therapy targeting prostatic acid phosphatase for advanced metastatic prostate cancer.
  * Other agents, like a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA-4 for advanced melanoma, have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials and are awaiting approval.

- **Challenges in evaluating immunotherapy agents:**
  * Traditional paradigms for clinical development may not be suitable for evaluating these agents, especially when used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies.
  * Identifying markers of biological response, ideally associated with clinical outcome, is essential for evaluating the biological effect of these agents used in combination.

- **Use of biomarkers in immunotherapy research:**
  * Antigen-specific vaccines have used immune responses to the target antigen as a biomarker of immunological efficacy, but there are few instances where target antigen immune response has been associated with clinical benefit.
  * For broadly active immune modulating agents, appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive, with studies seeking to identify potential biomarkers such as amplification of other T-cell costimulatory molecules or antibodies to defined antigenic tumor-associated proteins.

- **Machine learning in biomarker identification:**
  * The paper explores the use of machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) as a method for identifying potentially promising biomarkers and potential biomarker networks.
  * The study aimed to train several ML-BBNs to identify promising biomarkers and then use these networks to select a subset of features to train a network of immune biomarkers as they related to observed declines in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

  * Proliferation: the ability to extensively divide and grow.
  * Multipotency: the ability to give rise to various cell types.
- Stem cells in the lung are difficult to identify due to the low turnover rate of lung epithelia.
  * Populations of stem cells have been identified in the lung through their role in injury response.
  * The functional tenets of stem cell behavior (self-renewal, proliferation, and multipotency) have been observed in these cells.
- The earliest stages of lung malignancies may be related to a deregulation of the stem cell-based repair mechanism.
- The airway progresses from proximal to distal with different types of epithelium.
  * Cells capable of stem-like behavior in response to airway injury are present throughout the airway.
  * In proximal airways, tracheal basal cells expressing keratin-5 (k5) or keratin-14 (k14) have stem cell-like properties.
  * Squamous cell carcinoma frequently arises from the more proximal tracheobronchial airways and may be related to k5 stem cells.
- In middle airways, mature clara cells can proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny and repair the airway after injury.
  * Clara-cell secretory protein (CCSP)-positive cells located within neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) can repopulate the middle airways after naphthalene injury.

• The Iberian wall lizard, Podarcis hispanica, is a small lizard found in the Iberian Peninsula, with molecular and morphological studies suggesting it is paraphyletic and forms a species complex.

• A study was conducted to explore the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards in central Spain. The study found that:

- The lizards from different populations have distinct morphological characteristics and chemical compounds in their femoral gland secretions.
- Males from each population secreted a unique mixture of compounds used as sexual signals.
- Tongue-flick tests showed that these differences resulted in differential chemosensory recognition between some populations.
- The results suggested that there could be premating reproductive isolation between some, but not all, populations of this lizard.

</summary>

• The study found that there are morphological differences between lizards from the southern and northern populations. The lizards from the northern populations (fuenfra and golondrina) were larger, heavier, and had larger, more robust heads than the lizards from the southern populations (aranjuez and belmonte). These differences could be explained by the different contrasting environments where these populations live, with the northern mountains having cold temperatures, high humidity, and high altitude, and the southern plains having hot temperatures, dry conditions, and low altitude.

• The study also found that there are differences in the number of femoral pores and blue spots between the populations. Males from the northern populations have more femoral pores and less blue spots than males from the southern populations. These differences suggest that the importance of chemical and visual signals may differ between populations, with a higher number of femoral pores being related to a higher production of chemical secretions, and a larger number of blue spots representing a higher use of visual signals. The relative importance of these two sensory modes may be explained by the effectiveness of these two types of communication in different environments.

• The chemical analyses showed that femoral gland secretions of P. hispanica have carboxylic acids and steroids as predominant components.

• Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) has been advanced by the use of cell type specific molecular markers, enabling the description and analysis of developmental morphogenesis in various biological systems.
• Gene-specific RNA probes are widely used in WISH for visualizing gene expression patterns, providing valuable information about the role of specific genes during development and the positioning and movement of particular cell types at different stages.
• Fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts have several advantages over chromogenic methods, including higher quality three-dimensional imaging, multiplexing different RNA species, and covisualization of RNA with proteins. However, the use of fluorescent methods for WISH is limited by high endogenous background fluorescence and the limited brightness and photostability of organic fluorophores.
• Quantum dots (QDs), a new type of inorganic fluorophore, have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching. QDs have been used successfully for in situ hybridization in clinical biopsies for the detection of multiple mRNAs with successful conjugation to oligonucleotide probes.
• The use of QDs for WISH in xenopus embryos, one of the most highly autofluorescent vertebrate developmental organisms, suggests that QD whole-mount in situs will find successful applications in most developmental models.

- Analyzes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012
- Finds that recommendations for aspirin for CVD prevention do not match up to objectively computed future risk
- Highlights the need for improved clinical decision support to aid in accurate decisions for aspirin therapy

• Factors associated with physician recommendations for aspirin therapy:

- Among all primary prevention patients, education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention
- Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention
- Among low-risk individuals, age, health insurance status, education level, and obesity status were all predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin therapy

• Access to care and insurance status impact aspirin recommendations and usage:

- Lack of health insurance can be a significant barrier to accessing health care, including preventive services
- Previous research has found no relationship between insurance status and aspirin use among patients who accessed clinical preventive services
- The present results suggest that access to care may play a role in recommendations for the advice of aspirin for CVD prevention, and the use of it by patients

• Limitations of the study:

- Self-reported data on physician recommendations and other variables may be unreliable
- The study only examines adults age 40 and over, and there could be important patterns of use among younger individuals
- The study does not know how many respondents were recommended to take aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention versus for cancer prevention
- The study did not control for use of warfarin or other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy among respondents
- The available data from NHANES do not allow for elucidation of the role of gastrointestinal bleeding risk in the decision of physicians to recommend aspirin

• Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the standard treatment for localized prostate cancer, with numerous studies demonstrating excellent tumor control, good functional results, and low morbidity. However, long-term morbidity in the form of erectile dysfunction remains.

• Erectile dysfunction is caused by injury to the cavernosal nerves, which were identified by Walsh and Donker as branching from the pelvic plexus and running as a plexus of small nerves within a neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates.

• A study was conducted to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and construct a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution. The prostate, together with seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum, was removed en bloc from five adult male human cadavers and stained with anti-s-100 antibody neural stain to delineate the precise location of neural tissue.

• The study found that nerve fibers were distributed evenly around the prostatic capsule, with the exception of the ventral part, which had significantly fewer nerve fibers. The average number of nerve fibers in the ventral part of the prostate was 5.75±1.20, while the average number in the dorsal (rectal) part was 28.50±2.17.

• The three-dimensional model of the periprostatic nerve fibers revealed an almost even distribution and nearly similar thickness of periprostatic nerve fibers on dorsal and both lateral parts. However, the nerve fibers in the ventral part were substantially fewer in number and decreased in thickness.

• Traditionally, it was thought that cavernosal nerves branched from the pelvic plexus and ran as a plexus of small nerves within a prominent cord-like neurovascular bundle on the posterolateral border of the prostate.

• Polyhalite (chemical formula: K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O) is a mineral that commonly occurs in sedimentary evaporite successions and in rare cases as a sublimate in volcanic successions. It was first described in a salt mine in Bad Ischl, Austria, and has since been found in many salt deposits worldwide. In evaporites, polyhalite is commonly associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.

• The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and later confirmed. It can be synthesized in the laboratory under specific conditions. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite has been found to start at 255°C and reach a maximum of 343°C. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements significantly changes dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures.

• Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock. It is stable between room temperature (0-25°C) and 255-343°C and is of secondary origin in alpine salt deposits.

• Intracellular pathogens, like Leishmania, have evolved to coexist with host defense mechanisms

• In vitro studies of host-pathogen interaction exclude inflammatory milieu, while in vivo studies face challenges in distinguishing pathogen-specific responses from general inflammatory response

• General inflammatory response is driven by complement cascade, coagulation pathway, acute phase response, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which affect phagocyte function

• Transcriptomic response of uninfected cells exposed to inflammation can serve as a measure of normal in vivo response to insult, with cell-intrinsic pathogen-induced changes observed in infected cells but not in uninfected cells

• In a Leishmania infection model, an RXRA-centered transcriptomic pathway is aberrantly maintained in infected Kupffer cells (KCs), leading to enhanced parasite survival and validating the use of cells exposed to inflammation to discover pathogen-regulated transcriptomic pathways

• KCs in the liver of uninfected mice have large size, express membrane GFP, and are in intimate contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, exhibiting small fluctuations in cellular volume and surface area over time

• Explanation of appetite control:
	• Early theories focused on specific signals from glucose, amino acids, or adipose tissue
	• Recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue, gastrointestinal tract, and sensory features of food
	• Major signals include leptin, ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin

• Energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) relationship:
	• Mayer et al. (1956) proposed that any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI
	• Edholm's studies revealed no correlation between EE and EI in a single day, but there was a good correlation over 2 weeks
	• Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the largest component of total daily EE and could provide a tonic signal of energy demand

• Exercise and appetite:
	• Exercise can raise resting values of EE several fold
	• Exercise has numerous physiological effects, including changes in heart rate, blood flow, sympathetic nervous system activity, gut hormone activity, and nutrient absorption
	• A single acute bout of exercise and continued daily sessions of exercise may have different effects on appetite

• Research findings on exercise and appetite:
	• Acute bouts of exercise do not lead to a consistent increase in food intake
	• A partial compensatory response begins to appear when exercise sessions are repeated over time
	• Exercise causes an average weight loss of 3.3 kg over 12 weeks, indicating that the exercise EE was not fully compensated

• FFM (fat-free mass) and appetite:
	• Detailed analysis of body composition and appetite variables demonstrated that FFM, but not FM or BMI, is strongly correlated with meal size and daily EI
	• RMR, which is mainly contributed by FFM, reflects the influence of FFM on appetite control
	• RMR is positively associated with meal size, daily EI, fasting levels of hunger, and influences the profile of hunger across the day

• Proposed model of appetite regulation:

- **UVR Emitted During Arc Welding**
	+ Intense UV radiation (UVR) is emitted during arc welding, which can cause acute and delayed health effects in workers.
	+ UVR is emitted over the entire wavelength range excluding vacuum UVR, and its wavelength distribution varies depending on welding conditions.
	+ UVR from arc welding of steel consists mostly of a large number of spectral lines of iron scattered over this wavelength range.
- **Health Effects of UVR**
	+ Acute health effects of UVR include keratoconjunctivitis and erythema, while delayed health effects include cataracts and skin cancer.
	+ In a survey of 1667 workers at workplaces where arc welding is performed, 86% reported past experience with symptoms of uv keratoconjunctivitis, and 45% reported ongoing experience.
	+ Possible causes for this include workers mistakenly putting on their face shields after starting the arc or being exposed to UVR by co-workers performing arc welding nearby.
- **UVR Hazard and Protective Measures**
	+ The degree of hazard of the emitted UVR is thought to differ for each arc welding condition.
	+ It is necessary to examine the hazards of the UVR emitted during arc welding under various conditions to design protective measures.
	+ Local exhaust ventilation removes welding fume, which strongly mitigates UVR by scatter and absorption, and should be used to ensure that surrounding workers are not exposed to the UVR emitted by the arc.

• Bacterial cells with a higher content of PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoates) can survive longer due to their ability to utilize reserve material more efficiently.
• PHA are synthesized by many bacteria and archaea when carbon is available but other essential nutrients are not. They are divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units: SCL-PHA (short chain length) and MCL-PHA (medium chain length).
• The enzyme called PHA synthase plays a major role in PHA synthesis, and there are four classes of PHA synthases with different substrate specificities and subunit organizations.
• Extremophiles from polar areas are a source of novel enzymes with great economic potential in various industrial processes.
• The study aimed to determine whether bacteria from freshwater reservoirs in glacier forefield areas have the potential to synthesize PHA.
• Samples were collected from five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream located in the foreland of Ecology Glacier near the Polish Antarctic station Arctowski.

• GPS position, elevation, area, nutrient levels, pH, temperature, and conductivity were measured for each sampling site.
• Cells were scraped from the surface of slants and washed in sterile water, and DNA was extracted using a commercial kit.
• The partial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using specific primers, and PCR was performed with two primer pairs to detect microorganisms producing PHA.
• The first primer pair recognizes both SCL- and MCL-PHA synthase genes, while the second primer pair is specific for both genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis.
• The nucleotide sequences were submitted to the GenBank database, and the evolutionary distances were inferred using the neighbor-joining method.

	+ **Rainfall:** Natural rainfall is crucial for the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, although its amount and distribution play a significant role.
	+ **Soil moisture:** Moisture levels in the soil are critical for seed germination and establishment, and irrigation can benefit exotic weeds more than natives.
	+ **Soil type:** The soil type used in simulations was a loamy sand, which is common in the region and the primary soil type on a nearby mineland reclamation site.
	+ **Seed depth:** The seeds were assumed to be in the top 0.1 cm of the soil when the monsoon rains began, corresponding well to visual observations of seed depth after broadcast seeding on this soil type in this area.
	+ **Seed fate:** All seeds were assumed to germinate when exposed to suitable monsoon conditions, and wetting events that did not result in germination were assumed to cause no injury to these warm-season perennial grass seeds.

- **Modeling and simulation of soil moisture:**

	+ **Model used:** The Noah land surface model was used in this study with multiple options for parameterization schemes of various land surface processes.
	+ **Data sources:** Seven years of eddy flux data were available, including temperature/relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation, ground heat flux, soil temperature, precipitation, volumetric soil water content at different depths, wind velocity vector, sonic temperature, and concentrations of water vapor and carbon dioxide measurements.
	+ **Model calibration:** The model's hydraulic parameters were calibrated to match the observed soil moisture and surface energy and water fluxes from the flux tower data.
	+ **Model inputs:** The atmospheric forcing data to drive the model included hourly downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes, precipitation, air temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
	+ **Model outputs:** The model solved the one-dimensional Richards equation to account for redistribution of soil moisture among soil layers through diffusion and percolation processes.

• Factors related to bladder cancer and smoking:

- Bladder cancer is the second most common cancer in the urogenital tract.
- 85% of bladder cancer cases are limited to the urinary bladder at the time of diagnosis, while 15% have expanded beyond it.
- The first confirmed carcinogenic factors for bladder cancer are aromatic amines and chemicals contained in tobacco smoke.
- There are about 1.1 billion smokers worldwide, and in Poland, there are 9.5 million smokers, including 43% of men and 22% of women.
- Passive smoking is also a common social phenomenon, with 47% of men and 52% of women exposed to it at home and 55% of men and 27% of women exposed to it at work.
- Smoking is considered a shameful habit in Poland, and patients often deny or underreport their smoking history.

• Study on the reliability of patients' smoking history and compliance with smoking cessation recommendations:

- The study aimed to assess the reliability of patients' smoking history and their compliance with smoking cessation recommendations using a questionnaire and cotinine measurement, a marker of exposure.
- The study included patients treated in the department of general, oncologic, and pediatric urology of Collegium Medicum Nicolaus Copernicus University in Bydgoszcz, Poland, from June 2009 to December 2010, who had confirmed primary or recurrent bladder cancer by histopathological examination.
- Every patient who agreed to participate in the study signed an informed consent form and completed a questionnaire on smoking history and tobacco smoke exposure.
- Patients' urine cotinine levels were determined immediately after admission to the hospital to reduce the number of false-negative results.
- The analysis of cotinine, the main metabolite of nicotine, was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/DAD).
- The study found that not all patients admit to smoking, and not all follow the recommendations to quit smoking.

• High-risk HPV genital infections in young females are transient and have little long-term significance, but when the infection persists, there is a high risk of developing a precancerous lesion of the cervix.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Detection of anti-HPV has been shown to reflect the overall HPV infection rate in a population more effectively than detection of HPV DNA.

• The study population comprised 350 women of reproductive age attending the reproductive health clinic at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Zaria, Nigeria.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to screen for HPV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the serum samples.

• The study found that HPV igg antibodies were detected in serum samples from 42.9% (150/350) of women, indicating that the women had been infected and that the virus is circulating with a high prevalence in Kaduna state.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Infection with HPV is a major risk factor contributing to the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical carcinoma.

• Factors influencing codon usage bias in HMPV:
	• Nucleotide composition: The genome of HMPV has a high abundance of A/U nucleotides, which is consistent with the preferred codons that are all ended with A/U. This suggests that nucleotide composition is the main force affecting codon usage bias in HMPV.
	• GC3 skew: The GC3 skew of HMPV ranges from 0.371 to 0.592, indicating that GC composition is involved in the codon usage bias.
	• Nucleotide constraint: The first principle axis (f1) has a significantly negative correlation with u3% and negative correlation with gc3%, suggesting that nucleotide u3% and gc3% are the major factors influencing the synonymous codon usage pattern in HMPV genome.

• Phylogenetic distance and host factors:
	• Genotype analysis: The first and second dimension variables (f1 and f2) in the correspondence analysis can reflect 43.27% and 33.38% of the total mutation, respectively. Each genotype is mainly separated and clustered into two clades, suggesting that phylogenetic distance might affect the variation of synonymous codon usage in HMPV.
	• Enc-GC3% plot analysis: The plots of each HMPV genome are all under the expected curve, indicating that there are still other factors that can affect the codon usage bias of HMPV.
	• Comparative analysis: HMPV and human host cell share only one preferred codon, while HMPV and ampv host bird cell share six preferred codons. This suggests that host factor plays an important role in codon usage bias in HMPV.

• Mutation pressure and natural selection:
	• Enc-GC plot: The plots of all the 17 HMPV genomes are laid below the expected curve, suggesting that codon usage bias in all these genomes is principally influenced by mutation bias.
	• Enc analysis: The enc value of HMPV is consistent with other previously reported RNA virus in the same family Paramyxoviridae. The enc of HMPV is more close to respiratory infection agents",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_subpoints': 4, 'symbol': '•'}"

- MS is a chronic progressive disease affecting young adults, particularly women, and impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing physical activity can cause a marked imbalance in bone remodeling.
	+ Management of MS requires long-term disease-modifying therapy, such as glucocorticoids (GCS), which have a further negative effect on bone remodeling and bone strength.
	+ Secondary osteoporosis may develop, and low-trauma fractures occur more frequently in patients with MS than in healthy controls.
- Bone remodeling is underway throughout life and maintains bone strength by removing damaged bone and replacing it with new bone.
	+ Chronic diseases, such as MS, may significantly disturb the process of bone modeling and remodeling with resulting bone loss, deterioration of bone quality, and increased frequency of fractures.
	+ Secondary osteoporosis and low-trauma fractures occur in patients with MS more frequently than in healthy controls.
- The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in patients with MS are probably based on progressive immobilization, long-term GCS treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly on the presence of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of MS.
	+ Chronic use of other drugs, such as antidepressants, may contribute to the development of osteoporosis and fractures.
	+ The functional impairments of MS also lead to an increased risk of falling, which can increase the frequency of bone fracture in individuals with MS.

- A meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the 3 most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, including the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures.
* Multiple studies have confirmed the anatomical safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective.
- A cadaveric study aimed to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in a series of cadavers.
* The study found that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, and both techniques have a safe distance from the tapes to the obturator canal.
- The mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the in-out MUS measured 122 (95%CI: 107-136) versus 144 (95%CI: 131-151) for the out-in MUS (p = 0.02).
* The differences in the tapes' inner angles were significantly different, with a mean difference of 19.8 (median 19.0) (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.008).

• Conclusion of the location function discussion in budget balancing:
	+ The new black design is preferred over functionality.
	+ Many components will be standard, off-the-shelf items.
	+ Advanced chip and LCD display are required.
	+ The design will allow for adjusting the base of the joystick.
	+ The prototype gave more insight into the ergonomics of the design.
	+ The LCD display needs to be articulated for ergonomic design.
	+ The design could be done with a plastic casing and a rubber grip over the middle part.

• Product evaluation:

	+ The homing thing is still part of the design.
	+ The prototype is rated number one for finding it once it's lost.
	+ The sounder helps in finding the remote.
	+ The LCD display is a selling point, but it increases the cost.
	+ The joystick is defined as a scroll wheel.
	+ The use of an LCD display and a scroll wheel increases the cost.

• Budget issues:
	+ The budget is four Euros over what was hoped for.
	+ The use of the LCD display and an advanced chip increased the cost.
	+ The only way to get the cost down is to ditch the LCD display or alter the structure.
	+ Changing to a plastic and single curve design would allow for coming back into the proposed costs.

835," • Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, and Eluned Morgan AM, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, discussed the impact of Brexit on higher and further education
• Nine sector analyses have been conducted, including one for higher education, and ongoing work is being done to refine approaches as the debate in London and Europe becomes clearer
• Each institution has different challenges and exposure to European Union students and projects, so they are looking at their own specific needs within the broader picture
• There are no formal risk assessments available for scrutiny, but the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales has been doing specific work and officers have been visiting each institution to ensure they have their own plans in place
• The FE sector is more locally anchored and has fewer EU students and staff, so the impact of Brexit will be different than in HE
• The European transition team, which meets fortnightly, provides the governance structure for the Welsh Government as a whole in relation to European transition and leads discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, No. 10, and the Joint Ministerial Committee
• The student voice is considered in discussions through a close working relationship with the National Union of Students, who have been clear about the importance of Erasmus+ arrangements and the quality of faculty
• In the event of a 'no deal' Brexit, the HE sector would continue to have business as usual for European regional development fund and European social fund programs until 2020, but would have limited access to the Horizon 2020 programme and Erasmus+ for the last applications that could be made.",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Preparedness for Brexit:
	• Higher education: The Welsh Government has been working with higher education institutions to understand the potential impact of Brexit. Nine sector analyses have been superseded by work done by Cardiff University.
	• Funding: The UK Government has underwritten funding for European regional development fund and European social fund programs until 2020.
	• Risk assessments: There are no formal risk assessments available for scrutiny, but the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales has been doing specific work.

• Student voice: The Welsh Government has a close working relationship with the National Union of Students, and there is a consensus between the Government, universities, and students about the importance of participation in the Erasmus+ program and the need for security and stability for EU staff.

• Impact on Welsh Government: The European transition team, a fortnightly meeting of departmental leads, provides governance and coordinates the Welsh Government's response to Brexit.

• Student recruitment: There has been a significant drop in EU student applications in Wales this year, which is likely due to the change in Government policy regarding student support. The Welsh Government is working with HEFCW and individual institutions to test their preparedness for Brexit.

• European social fund: The UK Government has underwritten ESF funding until 2020, but the long-term impact on the broader economy and local industries is uncertain. The Welsh Government is engaging with FE colleges and ColegauCymru to understand the potential impact.

923," • The Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill aims to prohibit all forms of physical punishment of children to protect their rights and ensure equal protection from physical punishment as adults.
• Of those individuals who responded to the written consultation in a personal capacity, nearly 70 per cent do not support this Bill. However, representative surveys show support for the Bill's principles, particularly from parents with young children under seven.
• Opponents of the Bill, mostly older people, may resist the change due to their own experiences of being smacked or smacking their children. The Deputy Minister believes times have changed and children's rights should be respected.
• The Bill does not create a new offence but removes the defence of reasonable punishment for common assault. This change is not expected to cause significant negative impacts or increase workload for social services.
• An implementation group has been set up to address issues related to the Bill, including parenting advice and support, data collection, evaluation and monitoring, operations, procedures and processes, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.
• The implementation group includes representatives from the police, police and crime commissioners, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, the Association of Directors of Education in Wales, the Welsh Local Government Association, the legal profession, and the third sector.
• Four work streams have been established to look at parenting advice and support, data collection, evaluation and monitoring, operations, procedures and processes, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.
• The implementation group will also be updated on the progress of the awareness strategy that the Welsh Government will bring in. The Deputy Minister is confident that the legislation will be implemented in a practical and workable way.
• The Bill is expected to change the culture around physical punishment, making it clear that children should be treated with respect and dignity. This is seen as the last piece in the jigsaw for Wales' commitment to children's rights.
• The Welsh Government plans a big awareness campaign to ensure the public understands the implications of the Bill, as the research shows that awareness campaigns are essential for the legislation to be effective.",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_subpoints': 2, 'symbol': '•'}"

	+ Three types of batteries are considered: hand dynamo, kinetic, and solar powered.
	+ The remote control's shape could be flat, single curved, or double curved.
* The team discusses the use of an LCD display and the chip required to control it.
	+ A more advanced chip is needed for an LCD display, which would increase the cost.
	+ A number keypad is needed for channel selection, and it would be difficult to incorporate it into a double curved design.
* The team agrees on using conventional batteries, plastic or rubber for the case, and a single curved design.
	+ The use of conventional batteries allows for off-the-shelf components.
	+ Plastic or rubber are traditional and cost-effective materials for the case.
	+ A single curved design is more feasible for the number keypad and the use of titanium.
