2,"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Investment:**
   Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, his total investment is:
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Increased Value of the House:**
   The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value of the house is 150% more than the original purchase price of $80,000. To find the increased value, we calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original price:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value of the house} - \text{Total investment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give to her chickens each day. Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

\[
3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed are required for the final meal of the day. Since the total daily feed requirement is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given, the remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[

   \[
   \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week. The number of overtime hours is the total hours worked minus the regular hours:
   \[
   \text{Overtime hours} = 45 \, \text{hours} - 40 \, \text{hours} = 5 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Therefore, her overtime rate is:

Let's define:
- \( g \) as the number of gold coins.
- \( s \) as the number of silver coins.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   g + s = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   g = s + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( g \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[
(s + 30) + s = 110
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2s + 30 = 110
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2s = 80
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
s = 40

Now that we have the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the equation \( g = s + 30 \):

\[
g = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - If he sells 20 candles, his total revenue is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total costs:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds is:
     \[

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.
   - The number of articles written on Tuesday is:
     \[
     5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}

Let's break down the information given:

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. She purchased an unknown number of Post-it notes at the store. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. At work, she used 1 Post-it note for each of the 220 cups of coffee, so she used a total of 220 Post-it notes.
4. After using the Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Initial Post-it notes + Purchased Post-it notes - Used Post-it notes = Remaining Post-it notes

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Combine like terms: \( 80 - 220 = -140 \)
2. The equation becomes: \( -140 + x = 23 \)
3. Add 140 to both sides to solve for \( x \): \( x = 23 + 140 \)
4. Simplify: \( x = 163 \)

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many blue and red ties John bought and how much he spent on each type.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Determine the number of red ties:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties

48,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 4-foot long wire.

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we have a total of 48 inches of wire. We need to cut this wire into pieces that are each 6 inches long. To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the original 4-foot wire.

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:
     \[
     \text{Total units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - To find the number of occupied units, multiply the total number of units by the fraction that is occupied:
     \[
     \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**

   Tom is sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours (4 PM - 1 PM = 3 hours).

   The speed of the ship is 10 miles per hour.

   Distance = Speed × Time

   Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

1. **Calculate the weight removed by the comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - If Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed from the comic books is:
     \[
     30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the remaining weight that needs to be removed:**
   - Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds.
   - He has already removed 7.5 pounds by taking out the comic books.
   - Therefore, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:
     \[
     15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of toys to remove:**
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - To remove 7.5 pounds using toys, we need to find how many toys, each weighing 1/2 pound, add up to 7.5 pounds.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys to remove. Then:
     \[
     x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

2. **Weight of the Truck and Driver**: The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

3. **Weight of Each Box**: Each box weighs 15 pounds.

We need to find the maximum number of boxes, denoted as \( x \), that can be added to the truck without exceeding the total weight limit of the bridge.

First, calculate the remaining weight capacity available for the boxes:

\[

\[
\text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}

1. **TV Watching:**
   - Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time.
   - He does this 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, in one week, he spends \(2 \text{ hours} \times 3 = 6 \text{ hours}\) watching TV.

2. **Reading:**
   - Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV each time.
   - Since he watches TV for 2 hours each time, he reads for \(2 \text{ hours} \div 2 = 1 \text{ hour}\) each time.
   - He does this 3 times a week.
   - Therefore, in one week, he spends \(1 \text{ hour} \times 3 = 3 \text{ hours}\) reading.

3. **Total Time Spent in One Week:**
   - Total time spent on TV and reading in one week is \(6 \text{ hours (TV)} + 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 9 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Total Time Spent in 4 Weeks:**
   - In 4 weeks, Jim spends \(9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36.

We are given that the top level (4th level) of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16. Each level below has double the square footage of the level above it. Therefore, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. **4th Level (Top Level):**  
   The square footage is given as 16.

2. **3rd Level:**  
   Since each level below has double the square footage of the level above, the 3rd level will have \(2 \times 16 = 32\) square feet.

3. **2nd Level:**  
   Similarly, the 2nd level will have \(2 \times 32 = 64\) square feet.

4. **1st Level (Bottom Level):**  
   The 1st level will have \(2 \times 64 = 128\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- 1st Level: 128 square feet
- 2nd Level: 64 square feet
- 3rd Level: 32 square feet
- 4th Level: 16 square feet

Next, we calculate the average square footage of a level by summing the square footage of all levels and dividing by the number of levels:

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games. Therefore, the sum of the games won and lost is equal to 22:

Additionally, we know that the team won 8 more games than they lost. This can be expressed as:

\]

Now, we have a system of two equations:

2. \( w = l + 8 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation:

Simplify the equation:

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

2. **Annual Salary Calculation**: Her initial annual salary is calculated by multiplying her monthly salary by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Initial Annual Salary} = 600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]

3. **Salary Increase Policy**: According to the company's policy, Sylvie's salary increases by 10% of the initial salary every year after completing five years of service.

4. **Annual Increase Amount**: The annual increase amount is 10% of the initial annual salary:
   \[
   \text{Annual Increase} = 0.10 \times 7200 = 720
   \]

5. **Salary After Three More Years**: Sylvie's salary will increase by $720 each year for the next three years. Therefore, the total increase over three years is:
   \[
   \text{Total Increase Over Three Years} = 720 \times 3 = 2160
   \]

6. **Final Annual Salary**: Add the total increase to the initial annual salary to find Sylvie's salary after three more years:
   \[
   \text{Final Annual Salary} = 7200 + 2160 = 9360
   \]

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $9360.

- Let \( h \) be the number of copies Harald sold.
- Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold \( 10h \) copies.

According to the problem, the combined total of copies sold by Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
h + 10h = 88,000
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
11h = 88,000
\]

To find the number of copies Harald sold, solve for \( h \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
h = \frac{88,000}{11}

First, let's calculate the amount needed for the adults:
- There are 20 adults.
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- Therefore, the total amount for the adults is:
  \[
  20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time was 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

2. **Calculate the improved time for Gerald:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means that Gerald's time will decrease by 10% of his original time.
   - Calculate 10% of Gerald's original time: 10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 × 40 = 4 seconds.
   - Subtract this improvement from Gerald's original time: 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the group. Since there are 200 students in total and 80 of them are boys, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, James slept for 6 hours.

First, we know that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the canned tomatoes used.

Given that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, we can deduce that the original volume of the canned tomatoes before cooking was twice this amount, because they lose half their volume. Therefore, the original volume of the canned tomatoes was:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Thus, Freda used a total of 12 tomatoes to make her batch of tomato sauce.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, which means the thickness affects each dimension twice (once on each side).

1. **Calculate the inner length:**
   - Outer length = 5 inches
   - Wall thickness on both sides = 1 inch + 1 inch = 2 inches
   - Inner length = Outer length - 2 inches = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches

2. **Calculate the inner width:**
   - Outer width = 6 inches
   - Wall thickness on both sides = 1 inch + 1 inch = 2 inches
   - Inner width = Outer width - 2 inches = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches

3. **Calculate the inner height:**
   - Outer height = 4 inches
   - Wall thickness on both sides = 1 inch + 1 inch = 2 inches
   - Inner height = Outer height - 2 inches = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box using the inner dimensions:

- Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
- Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:

- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. We need to find out how many.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's calculate the total hours of TV he watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday for now:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30-minute show) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these up, we get:

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the remaining time he watched TV on Wednesday is:

7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes long, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours, we can calculate the number of 30-minute episodes he watched by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the duration of each episode:

Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. To find the total number of roll-ups she ate, we multiply the width by the length:

\[ \text{Beatrice's total roll-ups} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Marcell's roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. Similarly, we multiply the width by the length to find the total number of roll-ups he ate:

\[ \text{Marcell's total roll-ups} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice:

First, let's find out how far Julia rows in total to reach the shore. We know it takes her 64 seconds to reach the shore, and she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can calculate her rowing speed in feet per second:

\[
\text{Rowing speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second}
\]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}

1. **Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**

   We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   J = 6B
   \]

   where \( J \) is the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold, and \( B \) is the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Substituting the given value for \( J \):

   \[
   1800 = 6B
   \]

   Solving for \( B \):

   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Relate the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold to the number of ducks:**

   We are told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can express this relationship as:

   \[
   B = D + 50
   \]

   We already found that \( B = 300 \). Substituting this into the equation:

   \[
   300 = D + 50
   \]

   Solving for \( D \):

   \[
   D = 300 - 50 = 250

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 250.

115,"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate both her total cost for the lumber and the total revenue she will receive from selling it at the increased price. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the original cost:**

   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards × $10/board = $100

   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards × $16/board = $80

   - Total original cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price after the 50% increase:**

   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Original price per board = $10
     - Increased price per board = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15
     - Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards × $15/board = $150

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Original price per board = $16
     - Increased price per board = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24
     - Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards × $24/board = $120

   - Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270

3. **Calculate the profit:**

   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost
   - Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

Therefore, Sasha's profit from selling all the leftover lumber is $90.

Let's denote the number of parts of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of parts of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:

\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \(x\), divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used. Since the sugar is represented by \(7x\), we substitute \(x = 6\) into the expression for sugar:

\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

   Adrien's salary four years ago is given as $40,000.

2. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).

   Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary

   So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

3. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later is:

- Morisette brought 5 apples.
- Morisette brought 8 oranges.

Next, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, we calculate the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total tickets Pam used for the roller coaster is:
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ tickets}
  \]

- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times. Similarly, the total tickets Fred used for the roller coaster is:
  \[
  4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ tickets}

First, let's find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, we calculate the miles for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can set up an equation to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. Let \( x \) represent the miles walked on Wednesday. The equation for the total mileage is:

\[ 4 \text{ (Monday)} + 24 \text{ (Tuesday)} + x \text{ (Wednesday)} = 41 \]

We know the total number of cars is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[
\text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars})

Let's define:
- \( q \) as the number of queen bees,
- \( b \) as the number of baby bees,
- \( w \) as the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( w = 2b \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( b = 2q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ q + b + w = 700. \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( b \) and \( w \) in terms of \( q \) into the total equation:
- Since \( b = 2q \), substitute \( b \) in the total equation:
  \[ q + 2q + w = 700. \]

- Since \( w = 2b \) and \( b = 2q \), we have \( w = 2(2q) = 4q \). Substitute \( w \) in the total equation:
  \[ q + 2q + 4q = 700. \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 7q = 700. \]

Solve for \( q \):
\[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( q = 100 \), we can find \( b \) and \( w \):
- \( b = 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \).
- \( w = 2b = 2 \times 200 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is 400.

In this context, milk and eggs are considered food items, while light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are nonfood items.

Let's break down the costs:

1. **Food Items:**
   - Milk: $2

   Total cost for food items = $2 + $3 = $5

2. **Nonfood Items:**
   - Light bulbs: $3
   - Cups: $3
   - Roach traps: $4

   Total cost for nonfood items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so we calculate 10% of the total cost of nonfood items:

First, let's find out how many cookies Carl buys in total. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

Initially, Finn can see 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.

Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding from under a lily pad. This means that 6 additional tadpoles become visible to Finn. So, we add these 6 tadpoles to the 11 tadpoles he can already see:

11 (initially visible tadpoles) + 6 (tadpoles coming out of hiding) = 17 tadpoles visible.

Next, 2 of the visible tadpoles hide under a rock. This means that 2 tadpoles are no longer visible to Finn. So, we subtract these 2 tadpoles from the 17 tadpoles he can see:

17 (tadpoles visible after the first change) - 2 (tadpoles hiding under a rock) = 15 tadpoles visible.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200/month
   - 50% more than the minimum: \( 200 \times 0.5 = 100 \)
   - Total monthly payment: \( 200 + 100 = 300 \)

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500/month
   - 50% more than the minimum: \( 500 \times 0.5 = 250 \)
   - Total monthly payment: \( 500 + 250 = 750 \)

Next, we calculate the total monthly payment for all debts combined:

174,"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required to peel and cut all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel one potato. A minute and a half is equivalent to 1.5 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. To make it easier to add the times together, we should convert this time into minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is equivalent to \( \frac{5}{60} \) minutes, which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{12} \) minutes.

Now, let's find the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato. We add the time to peel one potato and the time to cut one potato:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} + \frac{1}{12} \text{ minutes} = 1.5 + 0.0833\overline{3} \text{ minutes} \]

This equals approximately 1.5833 minutes per potato.

Finally, we calculate the total time for all 60 potatoes by multiplying the time per potato by the total number of potatoes:

\[ 1.5833\overline{3} \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons they sold to make a profit of $25. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The cost per gallon is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar:

\[ \$3/\text{gallon for lemons} + \$2/\text{gallon for sugar} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon:

\[ \$10/\text{gallon} - \$5/\text{gallon} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Given that they made $25 in profit, we can find the number of gallons they sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per gallon:

\[ \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now that we know they made 5 gallons of lemonade, we can calculate how much they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so for 5 gallons, the total cost for lemons is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is $15.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

From point 2, we can find the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. Since 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 \times \text{(number of white carnations)} = 200 \]

Solving for the number of white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can use this information to find out how many red roses she ordered. According to point 1, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{(number of white carnations)} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

1. **Understanding the relationships:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark. Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \). Therefore, Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Information about Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - At that time, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Jan's current age is given as 30, so two years ago, half of Jan's age was \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years more than half of Jan's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 15 + 5

\]

**Team 2 (Less well-rounded team):**

The first runner of this team runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are as follows:

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for Team 2 is the sum of these times:

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**

Now, we compare the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \(\frac{1}{2}\), and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (\(\frac{1}{4}\)), we calculate:
\[ \left(\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}}\right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 is 100% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

- Let \( s \) be the total number of pieces of straw distributed.

We know the following:

2. Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
3. The rabbits collectively receive 20 pieces of straw.
4. The total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so the number of rats \( r \) is divisible by 3.

The hamsters are kept alone in 10 cages, so there are 10 hamsters.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:

Substitute \( h = 10 \) into the equation:

\[

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags:

- The trader sells each bag at $30, so for \( x \) bags, the revenue is:

**Friday Morning:**
- Initially, there are 18 pink flamingos.

**Saturday Morning:**
- The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos to paint them white. 
- One third of 18 flamingos is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
  \]
- So, 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white.
- These 6 white flamingos are then placed back on the yard.
- Therefore, on Saturday morning, there are:
  - \(18 - 6 = 12\) pink flamingos
  - \(6\) white flamingos

**Sunday Morning:**
- The neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos to the collection.
- Therefore, the number of pink flamingos becomes:
  \[
  12 + 18 = 30
  \]
- The number of white flamingos remains the same at 6.

**Final Calculation:**
- To find how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
  \[
  30 - 6 = 24
  \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are \(\boxed{24}\) more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. We know the cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:

Cost of one pen = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of one pen is $1.50, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 × Cost of one pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 × $1.50

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red chickens.
- \( w \) as the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens is \( 3r \).
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens is \( 5w \).
3. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs a day, so we have the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

Additionally, we know that there are two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)
2. \( w = r + 2 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

Subtract 10 from both sides:

Divide both sides by 8:

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in each pool now:

- The small pool now has \( x - 16 \) gallons.
- The big pool now has \( 2x - 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation:

1. Expand the right side:
   \[
   2x - 16 = 4x - 64
   \]

2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) on one side:
   \[
   2x - 4x = -64 + 16
   \]

3. Simplify:
   \[
   -2x = -48
   \]

4. Divide both sides by -2:
   \[
   x = 24
   \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Now, the small pool has:

\[
x - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8
\]

Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

First, let's account for the changes:
- James loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards becomes \(40 - 8 = 32\).
- James buys 14 more grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes \(20 + 14 = 34\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
- Total cards = fire type + grass type + water type
- Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

Next, we calculate the probability of picking a water type card:
- The number of water type cards is 32.
- The total number of cards is 96.

The probability of picking a water type card is given by the ratio of water type cards to the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96} \]

To convert this probability into a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{32}{96}\right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying \(\frac{32}{96}\):
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounding 33.33% to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

236,"To solve this problem, we need to consider how Ram can reuse the empty pens to create new full pens. 

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. As he uses these pens, they will eventually run out of ink, leaving him with 25 empty pens. According to the problem, Ram can combine the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen.

Let's break down the process:

1. **First Batch of Pens:**
   - Ram starts with 25 pens.
   - After using all 25 pens, he has 25 empty pens.

2. **Creating New Pens from Empty Pens:**
   - From the 25 empty pens, Ram can create new pens by combining the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.
   - The number of new pens he can create is calculated by dividing the number of empty pens by 5:
     \[
     \frac{25}{5} = 5
     \]
   - So, Ram can create 5 new full pens from the 25 empty pens.

3. **Second Batch of Pens:**
   - Ram now has 5 new full pens.
   - After using these 5 pens, he will have 5 more empty pens.

4. **Creating More Pens from the New Empty Pens:**
   - From these 5 empty pens, Ram can again combine the ink to make new pens.
   - The number of new pens he can create is:
     \[
     \frac{5}{5} = 1
     \]
   - So, Ram can create 1 additional full pen from these 5 empty pens.

5. **Final Batch of Pens:**
   - Ram now has 1 new full pen.
   - After using this pen, he will have 1 more empty pen.

6. **Checking for Further Possibilities:**
   - With only 1 empty pen left, Ram cannot create any more full pens since he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.

Now, we add up all the pens Ram has used:

- Initially, he had 25 pens.
- He created 5 new pens from the first set of empty pens.
- He created 1 more pen from the second set of empty pens.

Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is:
\[
25 + 5 + 1 = 31

1. We are given that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
\[
\text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A:**

   After 300 students exit through A, the remaining number of students is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700

4. **Calculate the number of students who exited through exit C:**

   The students who exit through C are the remaining students after exits A and B. We already calculated that 700 students remained after exit A, and 420 of those exited through exit B. Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is:

   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( R \) be the number of candies Robert has.
- James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has \( R + 6 \) candies.
- John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has \( 2R \) candies.

We are given that John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[
R = \frac{54}{2} = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has:
\[
R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
\]

John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies. To find how many more candies John has than James, we calculate the difference:

242,"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he still has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate the total number of letters Mike writes each week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week.
   - Mike responds to each letter, so he writes 2 letters per week for each pen pal.
   - With 3 pen pals, Mike writes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters per week.

3. **Determine the total number of pages Mike writes each week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike writes \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages per week.

4. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, writing 30 pages takes \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, \(180\) minutes is equivalent to \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S_1 \) be the number of snails in the first aquarium, which is 4.
- Let \( S_2 \) be the number of snails in the second aquarium, which is 32.
- Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
S_2 - S_1 = 2 \times (2F)

258,"To determine how much Nancy has to pay in total, we need to calculate the overdue charges for the books and add the flat fee.

1. **Calculate the overdue charges for the books:**
   - Nancy owes $0.50 for each overdue book.
   - She has 8 overdue books.
   - The total overdue charge for the books is calculated by multiplying the number of books by the charge per book:
     \[
     8 \text{ books} \times \$0.50 \text{ per book} = \$4.00
     \]

2. **Add the flat fee:**

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - We know Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Therefore, \( J_a + 8 = 52 \).
   - Solving for \( J_a \), we get \( J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \).

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.
   - Therefore, \( J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \).

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Therefore, Andrea has \( \frac{1}{2} \times J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

5. **Sum the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:**
   - Total fruits = Andrea's fruits + Jamal's fruits = \( 76 + 92 = 168 \).

First, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body. Therefore, the collar takes:
   \[
   \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Therefore, the rosette takes:
   \[

4. The entire sweater project is 1800 stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches accounted for by the body, collar, and rosette:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( S \):
\[
6S - 3S + 9 = 27
\]

Simplify:
\[
3S + 9 = 27

- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we need to determine how many stories each person wrote in the second week. According to the problem, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week during the second week.

- Alani doubled her 20 stories, so she wrote \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) stories in the second week.
- Braylen doubled his 40 stories, so he wrote \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) stories in the second week.
- Margot doubled her 60 stories, so she wrote \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) stories in the second week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stories each person wrote over the two weeks:

First, let's calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 stars and the rows of 6 stars:

1. **Rows of 8 stars:**
   - There are 3 rows, each with 8 stars.
   - Total stars from these rows = \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.

2. **Rows of 6 stars:**
   - There are 2 rows, each with 6 stars.
   - Total stars from these rows = \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.

Now, add the stars from these rows to find out how many stars are accounted for:

- Total stars from rows of 8 and 6 stars = \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars, subtract the stars already accounted for from the total number of stars:

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight. Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds.

To find the number of trucks needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Since 6000 pounds is exactly divisible by 2000 pounds, we need exactly 3 trucks to transport all the flagstones in one trip.

First, let's find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane:

A tabloid is typically made by folding large sheets of paper in half. Each sheet of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages of the tabloid. Here's how it works:

1. When you fold a single sheet of paper vertically, you create 4 pages: two on the front and two on the back.
2. For example, if you have a single sheet of paper, you might have pages 1 and 2 on the front, and pages 31 and 32 on the back.

Since each sheet of paper provides 4 pages of the tabloid, we can calculate the number of sheets needed for a 32-page tabloid by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet:

\[
\text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are needed to create a 32-page tabloid.

To find out how much she spent on food and snacks, we calculate half of $50:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks.

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

To find out the total amount she spent, we add the amount spent on food and snacks to the amount spent on rides:

\[
25 + 10 = 35
\]

Therefore, Annika spent a total of $35 at the fair.

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:

\[
50 - 35 = 15

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - It is given that Elise sold 45 books in the current year.

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - It is stated that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

3. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - We know the total number of books is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).
   - We have already calculated that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year.
   - Thus, the number of books sold in the second year is \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.

   - Watson works 10 hours per day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, he works \(10 \times 5 = 50\) hours per week.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are \(50 \times 10 = 500\) dollars.

2. **Calculate Watson's weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Since the company performed very well for the whole month, he receives this bonus every week.

3. **Calculate Watson's total weekly earnings:**

First, let's calculate Joey's weight loss per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, his weekly weight loss is:

\[
\text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

Next, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can set up a proportion to find out how many weeks it will take her to lose 8 pounds:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ weeks}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

- \( \frac{x}{2} \) as the number of players on the special teams, since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

According to the problem, the total number of team members is 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

322,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pencils can fit into one box and then calculate how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together.

First, let's find out how many pencils fit into one box. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Therefore, the pencils in the boxes are:

\[ \text{Total pencils} - \text{Loose pencils} = 26 - 2 = 24 \text{ pencils in boxes} \]

Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among the three boxes, we can find the number of pencils per box by dividing:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ pencils}}{3 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now that we know each box holds 8 pencils, we can calculate how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together.

Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils} \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ pencils}}{8 \text{ pencils per box}} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need a total of 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

1. **Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to calculate how many ice cubes are required:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

2. **Effect of Added Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

3. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (from cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker}

Therefore, the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters.

3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we add all these outfits together to find the total number of outfits:

\[
24 \text{ (from her friend)} + 48 \text{ (from the baby shower)} + 15 \text{ (from her mom)} = 87

1. **Determine the new daily distance:**
   Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters. This means Tyson should run an additional \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \) meters each day.

   Calculate the additional distance:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
   \]

   Therefore, the new daily distance Tyson should run is:
   \[
   5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for the month of June:**
   June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters each day, the total distance he covers in June is:
   \[
   6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters}

2. **Arcade tokens**: Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.
3. **Go-karts**: Each person rides the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10. Therefore, the cost for two rides is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up these costs to find the total cost per person:

Morgan has a total budget of $90. This budget must cover the costs for herself and her friends. Let \( n \) be the number of friends she can invite. Including herself, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).

The total cost for \( n + 1 \) people is:

   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 gumballs × $0.05/gumball = $2.

2. **Determine how much money Billy had left after buying candy:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
   - The cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars (since candy costs $1.5 per pound).
   - Billy started with $10.
   - After buying candy, he has \( 10 - 1.5x \) dollars left.

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his remaining money on gumballs.

1. **Distance from the first city to the second city:** 75 miles
2. **Distance from the second city to the third city:** 100 miles
3. **Distance from the third city back to the first city:** 

   The problem states that this distance is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip. So, we first calculate the combined distance of the first two legs:
   \[
   75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]
   Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is:
   \[

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders at the school is 96. Out of these, 43 are girls. Therefore, the number of boys can be calculated by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
\]

Next, we need to account for the absences on Friday. We are told that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. Since we are interested in the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys present on Friday} = 53 - 4 = 49

1. **Customers kicked out for not wearing masks:**  
   Let the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks be \( x \).  
   According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. **Customers kicked out for shoplifting:**  
   The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those kicked out for not wearing masks, minus 5.  
   Therefore, the number of shoplifters is \( 4x - 5 \).  
   Substituting \( x = 3 \), we get:  
   \( 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \).

3. **Customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale:**  
   Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.  
   Therefore, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

4. **Total number of people kicked out:**  
   We know the total number of people kicked out is 50.

5. **Customers kicked out for other reasons:**  
   Let the number of customers kicked out for other reasons be \( y \).  
   The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for not wearing masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons.  
   Therefore, we have the equation:  
   \[
   x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50
   \]
   Substituting the known values:  
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50

   Simplifying:  
   \[
   31 + y = 50

Let's calculate Erin's current total points:
- Sara's points = 8
- Erin's points = 3 times Sara's points = 3 * 8 = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we subtract the 14 points from her current total:

- Erin's points before scoring 14 = Erin's current total points - points scored = 24 - 14 = 10

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

1. **Determine the number of girls in the choir:**
   - The choir has 52 members, and 50% of them are girls.
   - Therefore, the number of girls is 50% of 52.
   - Calculation: \( 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \).
   - So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

2. **Determine how many girls were able to perform:**
   - On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down.
   - Therefore, only half of the 26 girls can perform.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).
   - So, 13 girls were able to perform.

3. **Add the teachers who decided to sing:**
   - The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls.
   - Therefore, we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls who were able to perform.
   - Calculation: \( 13 + 3 = 16 \).

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys tickets:

- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- There are 9 rides, so Dasha needs 9 rides × 2 tickets per ride = 18 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost for 18 tickets is 18 tickets × $2 per ticket = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:

- The ride bracelet costs $30 and allows for 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:

- Dasha's cost using tickets is $36.
- David's cost using a ride bracelet is $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost of the tickets:

- Savings = Dasha's cost - David's cost = $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying the ride bracelet instead of tickets.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. 

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common factor.

According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 5x + 6x = 165 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 11x = 165 \]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ x = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:**
   - Normally, Hulu costs $10 per month and Disney Plus costs $10 per month.
   - However, Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus.
   - The combined normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - The discount for bundling is 20% of $20, which is \(0.20 \times 20 = 4\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the bundled cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services:**
   - The total cost for all streaming services is the cost of Netflix plus the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus.
   - Total cost = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

4. **Savings by canceling cable:**
   - Tim's cable package cost $60 per month.
   - The savings is the difference between the cable cost and the total cost of streaming services.
   - Savings = $60 (cable) - $26 (streaming services) = $34 per month.

Thus, Tim saves $34 per month by canceling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

Initially, Allan has 40 cannolis. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the initial number of corns is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Next, Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has after his purchase. Since he now has 100 cannolis, the number of corns he buys is:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns} \]

Now, we add the initial number of corns to the number of corns he bought:

\[ 80 + 60 = 140 \text{ corns} \]

Finally, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:

\[ 100 \text{ cannolis} + 140 \text{ corns} = 240 \]

First, let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he walked:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.

Let's calculate the total number of steps he had taken before his jog:

- Steps from school walks: 5,000 steps
- Steps from the walk with his friend: 1,000 steps

Adding these together, we have:
\[
5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
\]

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can determine how many steps he had taken by the time he finished his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from his daily goal:
\[
10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
\]

Now, we know he had taken 6,000 steps before his jog and 8,000 steps after his jog. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[
8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
\]

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page has an average of 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[
45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words}
\]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read these 9000 words. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes him to read the entire book is:

\[
\frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport. Since it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60 minutes are up. Therefore, he effectively has:

\[
60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, and he has 50 minutes available, the time he will have left after finishing the book is:

\[
50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}

Thus, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- In May, the company hired 40 employees.
- Each employee worked a 40-hour workweek.
- Each employee was paid $15 per hour.

First, calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[ \text{Weekly payment per employee} = 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Since May has 4 weeks, the total payment for one employee in May is:
\[ \text{Total payment per employee in May} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total payment for all 40 employees in May:
\[ \text{Total payment for all employees in May} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
- Therefore, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ \text{Remaining employees} = 40 \, \text{employees} - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 \, \text{employees}\right) = 40 - 10 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Each of these 30 employees also worked a 40-hour workweek and was paid $15 per hour.

Calculate the weekly payment for one employee in June (same as in May):
\[ \text{Weekly payment per employee} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Since June also has 4 weeks, the total payment for one employee in June is:
\[ \text{Total payment per employee in June} = 600 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total payment for all 30 employees in June:
\[ \text{Total payment for all employees in June} = 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**

Add the total payments for May and June:
\[ \text{Total payment for May and June} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} + 72000 \, \text{dollars} = 168000 \, \text{dollars} \]

2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

Now, let's consider her sister's contribution:

1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals (heads) is 180.
2. The total number of humps (bumps) is 304.

We can translate these into equations:
1. The total number of heads (animals) is given by:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is given by:
   - Each camel has 2 humps, so the total number of humps from camels is \( 2c \).
   - Each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of humps from dromedaries is \( d \).
   Therefore, the equation for the humps is:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
1) & \quad c + d = 180 \\
2) & \quad 2c + d = 304
\end{align*}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into equation 1 to find \( d \):
\[
c + d = 180
\]
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 800 km.
   - 30% of 800 km = 0.30 × 800 km = 240 km.
   - Total distance for the next 2 days = 240 km.

3. **Next day (7th day):**
   - He wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 7 days × 300 km/day = 2100 km.

   - Peter's locker is given to be 5 cubic inches.

2. **Express the relationships mathematically:**
   - Let \( T \) be the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches.
   - Then, Zack's locker size \( Z \) is half of Timothy's locker size:

First, let's find the sale price of the jogger jeans. We know that the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[
28 - 6 = 22
\]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans. He saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the remaining \(\frac{2}{3}\) from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \(x\). The savings from the jogger jeans is then:

\[
x - 22
\]

According to the problem, \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings ($6) comes from the jogger jeans. Therefore:

x - 22 = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2

Thus, the original price of the jogger jeans was $24.

Now, we compare the original price of the jogger jeans to the price of the tattered jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, so the jogger jeans originally cost:

This result indicates that the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans, which contradicts the problem's requirement to find how much more they cost. Therefore, the jogger jeans did not originally cost more than the tattered jeans; they cost less.

1. **Bird feeders built by Lillian:**
   - Lillian built 3 bird feeders.
   - Each of these feeders attracts 20 birds plus an additional 10 birds because the birds prefer these feeders. 
   - Therefore, each feeder built by Lillian attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

2. **Bird feeders bought by Lillian:**
   - Lillian bought 3 bird feeders.
   - Each of these feeders attracts 20 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of birds attracted to each type of feeder:

- **Total birds attracted to the feeders built by Lillian:**
  \[
  3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds}

428,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared and how many were needed when 40 guests showed up.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - This means he prepared for 18 guests (half of 36) to have two hotdogs.

2. **Calculating Total Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - For the 18 guests who could have two hotdogs, he prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - For the remaining 18 guests, he prepared 1 hotdog each, which is \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 18 = 54\).

3. **Situation with 40 Guests:**
   - When 40 guests showed up, each wanted two hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).

4. **Calculating Shortage:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs, but 80 were needed.
   - The shortage of hotdogs is \(80 - 54 = 26\).

5. **Determining Guests Without a Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, and there was a shortage of 26 hotdogs, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

   - The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
   - The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
   - Each utensil costs $5.00, and she is buying 5 utensils, so the total cost for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25.00\).

   Add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
   \[
   120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00

First, we start by finding out how much gasoline is in each container. We know that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers. Therefore, the amount of gasoline in each container is:

\[
\frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents.
3. He had 1% of his money left after his purchases.

First, let's calculate how much George spent on the chips:

- Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.
- George bought 3 bags of chips.

The total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 40 \text{ cents/bag} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's determine how much money George had initially. Since he spent $5, we convert this to cents for consistency:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

George had 1% of his money left after his purchases. Therefore, the amount of money he had left is:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 500 \text{ cents} = 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money George actually spent. Since he had 5 cents left, the amount he spent is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

We know he spent 120 cents on chips, so the amount he spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost per candy bar:

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:

1. Swim: 40 minutes
2. Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
3. Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Next, we calculate James's time for each segment:

1. **Swim:** James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. To find James's swim time, we calculate 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes:

   10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 × 40 = 4 minutes

   James's swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

2. **Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so:

   James's bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

3. **Run:** We need to find James's run time. We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

   Jon's total time = 170 minutes
   James's total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James's run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

James's run time = James's total time - (James's swim time + James's bike time)

James's run time = 180 - (36 + 85)

James's run time = 180 - 121

James's run time = 59 minutes

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

1. Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. She also uses another 2 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with these eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs, so the number of glasses she can make is:
\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Rozanne puts out trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:
\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of the super ticket: $20
   - Additional cost for popcorn and soda: $1
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of the regular movie ticket: $12
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Let the regular price of popcorn be \( x \).
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option: $12 + $3 + \( x \)

According to the problem, by choosing the regular ticket option, you saved $2 compared to the super ticket option. Therefore, the equation for the savings is:

\[

**Becky's Total Cost:**

1. Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
   \[
   \text{Cost before discount} = 20 \times 45 = 900 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. Becky received a $1 discount. Since $1 is equivalent to 100 cents, we subtract this from her total cost.
   \[
   \text{Cost after discount} = 900 - 100 = 800 \text{ cents}
   \]

**Kelly's Total Cost:**

1. Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
   \[
   \text{Cost before discount} = 20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. Kelly received a 10 percent discount. First, we calculate 10 percent of 1000 cents.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 1000 = 100 \text{ cents}

**Difference in Cost:**

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid.
\[
\text{Difference} = 900 - 800 = 100 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, Kelly paid 100 cents more than Becky.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial cost is \(2 \times 4.00 = 8.00\) dollars.

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - The sale is buy one get one free, so when Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost after the buy one get one free discount is $4.00.

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Applying the coupon reduces the cost by $2.00.
   - So, the cost after applying the coupon is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Calculating the Cost Per Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so she receives \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors in total.
   - The total cost for the 8 razors is $2.00.
   - To find the cost per razor, divide the total cost by the number of razors: \(\frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25\) dollars per razor.

5. **Converting to Cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, \(0.25\) dollars is equal to \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

Therefore, the cost of each individual razor, in cents, after all discounts and the coupon is applied, is 25 cents.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found,
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found,
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   D = \frac{B}{2}
   \]

Now, we can use these equations to find the number of insects each person found.

First, let's express \( D \) in terms of \( B \) using equation 3:
\[
D = \frac{B}{2}
\]

Substitute \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) into equation 2:
\[
L = \frac{B}{2} + 7
\]

Now substitute both \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into equation 1:
\[
\left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right) + \frac{B}{2} + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + B + 7 = 43
\]

Simplify:
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we know \( B = 18 \), we can find \( D \) using \( D = \frac{B}{2} \):
\[
D = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]

Finally, find \( L \) using \( L = D + 7 \):
\[
L = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

   - Since 1 pound of body weight is approximately equivalent to a 3500 calorie deficit, losing 30 lbs requires a total calorie deficit of:
     30 lbs × 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
     105,000 calories ÷ 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- Hannah runs 8 laps.

To find the total distance, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water Hannah needs to drink for this distance. We know that she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 kilometers, the amount of water she needs is:

\[ \text{Water needed} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Thus, Hannah needs to drink 120 milliliters of water.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot. Therefore, the cost of the house can be expressed as \( 3L \).

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we combine like terms:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]

\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of the house} = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

First, let's find out how long it takes for one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take them twice as long. Therefore, it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we need to calculate how long it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house. Since work is additive, if 5 people are working together, they can complete the task 5 times faster than one person alone. Therefore, the time it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house is:

Time for 1 person to paint a whole house / Number of people = 10 days / 5 = 2 days.

Now, we need to convert this time into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, the total number of hours in 2 days is:

   - So, Ophelia has 22 chairs and 20 sofas.

2. **Determine Jenna's number of chairs and sofas:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, if Jenna has \( C_J \) chairs, we have:
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66

   - Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, if Jenna has \( S_J \) sofas, we have:
     \[
     S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
     \]
   - So, Jenna has 66 chairs and 64 sofas.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Jame's age in 8 years will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).
   - To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: \(55 - 8 = 47\).

3. **Calculate the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - His cousin's current age is 47.

2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.
4. We need to find the cost of one monitor.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of the Printer:**
   Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
   \]

2. **Total Cost of the Computer and Printer:**
   We can now find the combined cost of the computer and the printer:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of computer and printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800

3. **Cost of the Monitors:**
   The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Therefore, the cost of the 2 monitors is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600
   \]

4. **Cost of One Monitor:**
   Since the total cost of 2 monitors is $600, the cost of one monitor is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300

First, let's establish the number of boys and girls. Since the kids were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by the boys. Each boy brought back 60 seashells, and there are 10 boys, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:

\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells per boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

According to the problem, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:

\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought back. Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells per girl} \]

541,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis should save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

First, let's break down the month of April. April has 30 days. We can divide these 30 days into two halves:
- The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15).
- The second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16 to April 30).

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day during the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first 15 days, he saves a total of:
\[
15x
\]

In the second half of the month, Elvis saves twice as much each day as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day during the second half. Over the 15 days of the second half, he saves a total of:
\[
15 \times 2x = 30x
\]

The total savings for the entire month of April is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[
15x + 30x = 45x
\]

We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
45x = 1125
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 45:
\[
x = \frac{1125}{45}
\]

Calculating the division:
\[
x = 25
\]

Thus, Elvis saves $25 each day during the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, the daily savings for the second half is:
\[
2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( x \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff receives \( 4x \).

The total amount of money they have together is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold.

2. **Time to swim a mile in warm water:**
   - The problem states that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water.
   - Twice as long as 16 minutes is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.
   - Therefore, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes when the water is warm.

3. **Time to swim 3 miles:**
   - On a cold day, Ray swims 3 miles in \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
   - On a hot day, Ray swims 3 miles in \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

4. **Difference in time:**
   - The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

**First Week:**

Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights. Therefore, the total time she spent reading in the first week is:

\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}

We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we first determine how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:

\[
\frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals}

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age.

We can express this relationship with the equation:

   - According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( R = M + 20 \).
   - Since Richie scored 80 goals, we substitute \( R = 80 \) into the equation: 
     \[
     80 = M + 20
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \), we subtract 20 from both sides:

   - So, Mark scored 60 goals.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - The problem states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( R = A + 45 \).
   - Again, substituting \( R = 80 \) into the equation:
     \[
     80 = A + 45
     \]
   - Solving for \( A \), we subtract 45 from both sides:

     A = 80 - 45 = 35

   - So, Anna scored 35 goals.

4. **Total Goals Scored by All Three Teenagers:**

  Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is:

  \[
  \text{Cost of Bread} = 3 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Cost of Cheese and Condiments:**

  The cost for cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is given as $30.00.

  \[
  \text{Cost of Cheese and Condiments} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Bread} + \text{Cost of Cheese and Condiments} = 3 + 30 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 70 - 33 = 37 \text{ dollars}
\]

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees:

1. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when set to 450 degrees.
2. The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
3. To find the percentage error, we divide the difference by the set temperature and multiply by 100:

   \[
   \text{Percentage error} = \left(\frac{18}{450}\right) \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

This means the oven is off by 4% higher than the set temperature.

Next, we need to find the set temperature for a recipe that requires an actual temperature of 520 degrees, considering the same 4% error:

1. Let \( x \) be the set temperature that results in an actual temperature of 520 degrees.
2. Since the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature:

   \[
   520 = x + 0.04x = 1.04x

1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years.

2. **Setting up the equation**: 
   - Let \( x \) be Jerry's age 5 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jerry's current age is \( 2x \) (since he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago).

3. **Relating the ages**:
   - 5 years ago, Jerry was \( x \) years old.
   - Now, Jerry is \( 2x \) years old.

4. **Finding Jerry's current age**:
   - Since Jerry is currently \( 2x \) years old, we need to express this in terms of his age 5 years ago.
   - 5 years ago, Jerry was \( x \) years old, so now he is \( x + 5 \) years older than he was 5 years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 2x = x + 5 \).

5. **Solving the equation**:
   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides: \( 2x - x = x + 5 - x \).
   - This simplifies to \( x = 5 \).

6. **Finding Jerry's current age**:
   - If \( x = 5 \), then Jerry's current age is \( 2x = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

7. **Finding Jerry's age in 3 years**:
   - In 3 years, Jerry will be \( 10 + 3 = 13 \) years old.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the implants:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the base cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000
     \]

2. **Add the cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The porcelain crown costs an additional $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500
     \]

3. **Subtract the deposit:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of hours he needs to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260

597,"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the angles in the triangle.

Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so we can denote this angle as \( 2x \). Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so we denote this angle as \( 3x \).

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
6x = 180
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by 6:

\[
x = \frac{180}{6} = 30

Now that we have \( x = 30 \), we can find the measures of the other two angles:

- The angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

623,"To determine Charmaine's current age, we start by considering the information given: Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. This means that her current age plus 12 years equals 16 years.

Let's set up an equation to represent this:

Current age + 12 years = 16 years

To find Charmaine's current age, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

Current age = 16 years - 12 years
Current age = 4 years

Now that we know Charmaine is currently 4 years old, we can determine how old she will be 4 years from now. We simply add 4 years to her current age:

Age in 4 years = Current age + 4 years
Age in 4 years = 4 years + 4 years
Age in 4 years = 8 years

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

Manny signed up for 10 classes at a total cost of $60. The cost per class is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of classes he attends.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny attends. The cost per class is given by:

\[

\]

We need this cost per class to be less than or equal to $10:

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10x
\]

Divide both sides by 10:

     \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, the cost of 5 apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, the cost of 5 oranges is:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

For Bob's hole, the dimensions are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture, which consists of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound of almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts.

1. The cost of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound of almonds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
   \]

2. The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts:
   \[
   \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5

3. Total cost of the first mixture:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 = 10

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture, which consists of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound of almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts.

1. The cost of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound of almonds:
   \[
   \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2
   \]

2. The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound of walnuts (same as before):
   \[
   \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
   \]

3. Total cost of the second mixture:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 + 5 = 7

660,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads is the sum of the sheep and geese:
   \[
   s + g = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs each, and geese have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   4s + 2g = 70
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, solve for \( g \):
\[
g = 20 - s
\]

Substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the second equation:
\[
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
\]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
\]
\[
2s + 40 = 70
\]
\[
2s = 70 - 40
\]
\[
2s = 30
\]
\[
s = 15

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

682,"To find the original length of the dress, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means she adds \( 0.5x \) cm to the original length.

Additionally, she adds a lace trim of 20 cm to the bottom of the dress.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation for the final length as:

\[
x + 0.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
1.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
1.5x = 120
\]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{120}{1.5}
\]

Calculating the division:

\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

683,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Chris to mow his entire lawn when he uses both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes for half of the lawn each.

First, let's understand the rates at which Chris mows the lawn in each mode:

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, his mowing rate in turtle mode is 1 lawn per 60 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, his mowing rate in rabbit mode is 1 lawn per 40 minutes.

Now, Chris mows half of the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode. We need to calculate the time taken for each half:

1. **Time to Mow Half the Lawn in Turtle Mode:**
   - Since Chris mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes in turtle mode, mowing half the lawn will take half of that time.
   - Time taken = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.

2. **Time to Mow Half the Lawn in Rabbit Mode:**
   - Since Chris mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode, mowing half the lawn will take half of that time.
   - Time taken = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Finally, we add the time taken for each half to find the total time taken to mow the entire lawn:

- Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
- Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn using both modes.

1. They have 30 minutes in total to walk to school.
2. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
3. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we add the time it takes to get to the library and the fire station:

6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Next, we subtract the time spent walking so far from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time spent so far) = 11 minutes

- Let \( t \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( r \) be the age of one of the triplets.

From the problem, we know:

1. There are two twins, so their combined age is \( 2t \).
2. There are three triplets, so their combined age is \( 3r \).
3. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so \( t = r + 7 \).
4. The combined ages of all the twins and triplets is 44, so \( 2t + 3r = 44 \).

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( t \) from the third equation into the fourth equation:

\[
2(r + 7) + 3r = 44
\]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[
2r + 14 + 3r = 44
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[
5r = 30

First, we know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. We are also given that each lollipop costs $0.40.

Let's calculate the total cost of the five lollipops:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 lollipops} = 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Now, we know that the total cost of the five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Therefore, the cost of the four candies can be found by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:
\[ \text{Cost of 4 candies} = 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of the four candies by 4:
\[ \text{Cost of 1 candy} = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now that we know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40 and the cost of one candy is $0.30, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.

First, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Next, calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

We know that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. The cat's speed is given as 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed can be calculated by dividing the cat's speed by 5:

\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:

\[
\text{Distance crawled by turtle} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}

First, we calculate the rate at which money is being raised per hour. Since $2100 was raised in 3 hours, the rate of fundraising per hour is:

\[
\text{Rate per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more money is needed to reach the goal of $6300. The amount still needed is:

Now, we calculate how many additional hours are required to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour:

\[
\text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate how many quarts of each type of ice cream can be made in 48 hours:

1. Chocolate ice cream:
   - Production rate is 50 quarts per hour.
   - In 48 hours, the factory can produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

Initially, the restaurant has:
- 170 normal chairs
- 23 chairs for babies

The number of chairs sent for repair is:
- 20 normal chairs
- 13 baby chairs

Now, let's calculate the remaining chairs for each type:

1. **Normal Chairs:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining normal chairs} = 170 - 20 = 150
   \]

2. **Baby Chairs:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining baby chairs} = 23 - 13 = 10

First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizza, so there were 5 pizzas in total. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends.

1. **Bryce and two friends**: They each ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, the total number of pizzas they ate is:

\[
3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices eaten by this group is:

\[
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ slices}
\]

2. **The two remaining friends**: They each ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people in this group, the total number of pizzas they ate is:

\[
2 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ pizzas}
\]

The total number of slices eaten by this group is:

\[
\frac{3}{2} \times 12 = 18 \text{ slices}
\]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices consumed:

\[
24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find how many slices are left:

\[
60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices}

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

1. **Time taken by the cat:**
   - The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

2. **Time taken by the dog:**
   - The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes to eat the same number of sausages.
   - Therefore, the time taken by the dog is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \) minutes.
   - Calculating this gives: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Average time taken by the cat and the dog:**
   - To find the average time, we add the time taken by the cat and the time taken by the dog, and then divide by 2.
   - The sum of the times is \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.
   - The average time is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) minutes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, 8 feet is equal to:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's set up an equation to represent the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. This can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]

\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]

\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Three-fourths of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Melissa has:
- 8 dogs that need to be bathed,
- 5 cats that need their nails clipped,
- 3 birds that need their wings trimmed,
- 12 horses that need to be brushed.

We add these numbers together to find the total number of animals:

\[ 8 \text{ (dogs)} + 5 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (birds)} + 12 \text{ (horses)} = 28 \text{ animals} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days there are in a week, which is 7 days.

To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in the week:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ animals}}{7 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ animals per day} \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Expenses**

Mark buys 3 packs of cards, each costing $1800. Therefore, his total expenses are:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue**

Mark sells the cards he obtained from the packs. He has:

- 1 card worth $4000
- 1 card worth $1000
- 30 cards, each worth an average of $50

First, calculate the total value of the 30 cards:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Now, add up the values of all the cards:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Profit**

Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total expenses:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults. So, the total cost for adults is \( 2 \times 26 = 52 \).
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children. So, the total cost for children is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \( 52 + 24 = 76 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults. So, the total cost for adults is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \).
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children. So, the total cost for children is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \).
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \( 28 + 20 = 48 \).

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks to determine the savings:
- The cost difference is \( 76 - 48 = 28 \).

Thus, Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

1. **Calculate the cost difference per tomato:**

   The old cost per tomato was $0.50, and the new cost per tomato is $0.40. Therefore, the cost difference per tomato is:

   \[
   0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10
   \]

   So, the vendor saves $0.10 per tomato.

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes sold per week:**

   The vendor sells 500 tomatoes per day. Assuming he sells tomatoes every day of the week, the total number of tomatoes sold per week is:

   \[
   500 \times 7 = 3500
   \]

3. **Calculate the total savings per week:**

   The total savings per week is the cost difference per tomato multiplied by the number of tomatoes sold per week:

   \[
   0.10 \times 3500 = 350

First, let's determine the number of weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month. A week consists of 7 days, with 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

For one 4-week month:
- Weekdays: 4 weeks × 5 weekdays/week = 20 weekdays
- Weekends: 4 weeks × 2 weekend days/week = 8 weekend days

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Chairs rented on weekdays: 60 chairs/day × 20 weekdays = 1,200 chairs
- Chairs rented on weekends: 100 chairs/day × 8 weekend days = 800 chairs

Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = 1,200 chairs (weekdays) + 800 chairs (weekends) = 2,000 chairs

Since we need to find the total for two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one month by 2:

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.
- \( y \) as the number of votes against the new regulation.

According to the problem, the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against. This gives us the equation:
\[ x = 2y \]

Additionally, we know that the total number of council members is 33, which means the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33:
\[ x + y = 33 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( x = 2y \)
2. \( x + y = 33 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2y + y = 33 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 3y = 33 \]

To find \( y \), divide both sides by 3:
\[ y = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Now that we have \( y = 11 \), we can find \( x \) using the first equation:

2. The third house needs double the cases of the first house: \( z = 2x \).
3. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250: \( x + y + z = 250 \).

First, substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) into the equation for \( z \):

Now, substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \) and \( z = y \) into the total cases equation:

- 5 points for each berry collected.
- 30 points for each second left on the timer.

Now, let's calculate the scores:

**Emma's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times B \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times T \)

Emma's total score is:

2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which were a mix of orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's define some variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- Let \( y \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of fish bought is 17, so \( x + y = 17 \).

After adding the fish from the store to his pond, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + x \), and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. From \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[ x = 17 - y \]

2. Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):

   - One-way distance from home to office = 5 miles
   - Round-trip distance (home to office and back) = 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles

2. **Calculate the weekly distance:**
   - Andy drives to work 5 days a week (Monday to Friday).
   - Weekly distance = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

3. **Calculate the amount of gas used per week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency = 10 miles per gallon (MPG)
   - Gas used per week = Total weekly distance / Fuel efficiency
   - Gas used per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

4. **Calculate the cost of the gas used per week:**
   - Price of gas = $3 per gallon
   - Cost per week = Gas used per week * Price per gallon
   - Cost per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car consumes per week is $15.

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**

   Carrie was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is calculated as follows:

   \[
   140 \times 0.25 = 35
   \]

   Therefore, the total value of the quarters is $35.

2. **Calculate the value of the twenties:**

   Carrie was given ten twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, so the total value of the twenties is:

   \[
   10 \times 20 = 200
   \]

   Therefore, the total value of the twenties is $200.

1. **Calculate the night temperature:**
   - Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
   - Temperature drop at night: 33 degrees
   - Nighttime temperature = Daytime temperature - Temperature drop
   - Nighttime temperature = 45 - 33 = 12 degrees

2. **Determine the temperature increase needed:**
   - The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees.
   - Current nighttime temperature: 12 degrees
   - Required temperature to prevent freezing: 32 degrees
   - Temperature increase needed = Required temperature - Current nighttime temperature
   - Temperature increase needed = 32 - 12 = 20 degrees

3. **Calculate the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log increases the temperature by 5 degrees.
   - Number of logs needed = Temperature increase needed / Temperature increase per log
   - Number of logs needed = 20 / 5 = 4 logs

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups formed.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members that each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members bringing back seashells. We calculate 3/5 of the total number of groups:

\[
\text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Thus, 6 groups had members bringing back seashells.

Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Since each group consists of 9 members, the total number of seashells brought back by one group is:

\[
\text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18

First, let's calculate the pass rate for each grade:

1. **Third Grade:**
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340
   - Total number of third-graders: 500
   - Pass rate for third grade = (Number of third-graders who passed) / (Total number of third-graders) = 340 / 500 = 0.68 or 68%

2. **Fourth Grade:**
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40
   - Total number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Pass rate for fourth grade = (Number of fourth-graders who passed) / (Total number of fourth-graders) = 40 / 100 = 0.40 or 40%

3. **Fifth Grade:**
   - The pass rate for fifth grade is twice the pass rate of the fourth grade.
   - Pass rate for fifth grade = 2 * (Pass rate for fourth grade) = 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 or 80%
   - Total number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed = Pass rate for fifth grade * Total number of fifth-graders = 0.80 * 400 = 320

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test:

- Total number of students who passed = Number of third-graders who passed + Number of fourth-graders who passed + Number of fifth-graders who passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

- Total number of students who took the test = Total number of third-graders + Total number of fourth-graders + Total number of fifth-graders = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Finally, the overall pass rate for the school is calculated as follows:

Overall pass rate = (Total number of students who passed) / (Total number of students who took the test) = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%

   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - The number of 20-minute intervals in 240 minutes is \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\).
   - Therefore, Jack uses 12 quarters.

2. **Two Friends' Playtime (each can play half as long as Jack):**
   - Each of these friends can play for half of 20 minutes with 1 quarter, which is \(20 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - The number of 10-minute intervals in 240 minutes is \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\).
   - Therefore, each of these two friends uses 24 quarters.
   - Since there are two friends, the total number of quarters used by these two friends is \(24 \times 2 = 48\).

3. **One Friend's Playtime (can play 1.5 times as long as Jack):**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times 20 minutes with 1 quarter, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

- \( f \) as the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
- \( s \) as the amount of salt (in ounces).
- \( o \) as the amount of oil (in ounces).
- \( u \) as the amount of sugar (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance: \( z = f \).
2. The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar: \( s = u \).
3. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
4. The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest: \( s = 2z \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + o + u = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total equation:
- Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \).
- Since \( s = u \), we can replace \( u \) with \( s \).
- Since \( o = 2s \), we can replace \( o \) with \( 2s \).
- Since \( s = 2z \), we can replace \( s \) with \( 2z \).

The equation becomes:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2(2z) + 2z = 10 \]

Simplifying:
\[ 2z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we find \( s \) using \( s = 2z \):
\[ s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

Substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Now substitute \( B = 3P + 12 \) and \( S = 3P \) into the total equation \( B + S + P = 341 \):
\[
(3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( P \):
\[
7P = 329
\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[
P = 47
\]

Now that we have \( P = 47 \), we can find \( S \) using \( S = 3P \):
\[
S = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]

Finally, we find \( B \) using \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 141 + 12 = 153

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.
   - Refund = 0.75 * $32 = $24

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - Cost per pound = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

   - The shipping company also charges $0.08 per mile. The distribution center is 20 miles away.
   - Cost per mile = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

   - Total shipping cost = Cost per pound + Cost per mile = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

3. **Calculate the total loss:**
   - Milly originally paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will pay $3.00 for shipping.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos each week = 18 videos × 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup each day for six days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup each week = 15 minutes/day × 6 days = 90 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on TikTok-related activities each week:

The initial installation package for $129.00 includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela needs to install:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, let's calculate the additional items Angela needs installed:

1. **Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors, but the package includes installation for 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs installation for \(6 - 4 = 2\) additional mirrors.

2. **Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the package includes installation for 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs installation for \(2 - 1 = 1\) additional chandelier.

3. **Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, but the package includes installation for 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs installation for \(20 - 10 = 10\) additional pictures.

Now, let's calculate the total number of additional items:
- Additional mirrors: 2
- Additional chandeliers: 1
- Additional pictures: 10

Total additional items = \(2 + 1 + 10 = 13\)

The cost for installing additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the cost for the additional items is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the additional items to the initial installation cost:
\[ 129 + 195 = 324 \]

   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's Lifting Capability:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.

3. **Kagiyami's Lifting Capability:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.

4. **Naruto's Lifting Capability:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Finally, we need to convert Naruto's lifting capability from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[
\text{Height in feet} = \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}

1. **First Part of the Journey:**
   - Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours.
   - The distance covered in this part is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - After taking a rest, Mason continues to travel at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for another 6 hours.
   - The distance covered in this part is:

835,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between speed, time, and distance. The key here is that the distance traveled by the kangaroos and the turtles is the same.

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v \). Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the time taken by one kangaroo to travel the same distance is also 18 hours, because the number of kangaroos does not affect the time taken if they are traveling independently.

The distance \( d \) traveled by a kangaroo is given by the formula:
\[
d = v \times t
\]
where \( t = 18 \) hours.

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

We need to find the time \( t' \) it takes for a turtle to travel the same distance \( d \). Using the formula for distance again:
\[
d = \frac{v}{2} \times t'
\]

Since the distance \( d \) is the same for both the kangaroo and the turtle, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
\[
v \times 18 = \frac{v}{2} \times t'
\]

We can cancel \( v \) from both sides (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):
\[
18 = \frac{1}{2} \times t'
\]

Solving for \( t' \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
t' = 36
\]

Therefore, it will take one turtle 36 hours to travel across the highway. Since the turtles are traveling independently, the number of turtles does not affect the time taken for one turtle to travel the distance.

Thus, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is also 36 hours.

846,"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, accounting for the intermission.

1. **Calculate the total time for each group:**
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Performance time: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

   Total time per group = 2 minutes (get on stage) + 6 minutes (perform) + 2 minutes (exit) = 10 minutes.

2. **Account for the intermission:**
   - Intermission time = 10 minutes

3. **Calculate the total available time for performances:**
   - Total concert time = 2 hours = 120 minutes
   - Subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find the time available for groups to perform.

   Available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes.

4. **Determine how many groups can perform:**
   - Each group takes 10 minutes.
   - Divide the available time by the time per group to find the number of groups.

   Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

847,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that her investment accumulates simple interest.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the rate of interest per year,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The rate of interest \( r \) is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, three-quarters of this is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{300} \times 3 \]

Since the rate is given as a dollar amount per year, we can directly use it:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

1. **Determine the number of indoor plants:**
   - Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in total.
   - One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants.
   - Calculate the number of indoor plants: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
     \]
   - So, there are 25 indoor plants.

2. **Determine the number of remaining plants:**
   - Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants:
     \[
     100 - 25 = 75
     \]
   - So, there are 75 remaining plants.

3. **Determine the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants.
   - Calculate the number of outdoor plants:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
     \]
   - So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

4. **Determine the number of flowering plants:**
   - The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants.
   - Subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:
     \[
     75 - 50 = 25
     \]
   - So, there are 25 flowering plants.

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   - The percentage of flowering plants is calculated by dividing the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and then multiplying by 100:
     \[
     \left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. We are told that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can express the speed of the thingamabob as follows:
   \[
   \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

3. We are also told that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can express the speed of the whirligig as follows:
   \[
   \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}

1. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
4. In total, Ellen pays $11 for her goods every day.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( x \).

The total cost for two carrots is \( 2x \).

The total cost for all the items Ellen buys is:
\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to solve for \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so the total amount she earned from Joe is \( 6x \).

**First Week:**
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- We don't know how much Kamala paid per mowing, so let's denote the payment per mowing for Kamala as \( k \). Therefore, the total amount she earned from Kamala is \( 3x \cdot k = 3kx \).

**Second Week:**
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Similarly, let \( a \) be the payment per mowing for Alba. Therefore, the total amount she earned from Alba is \( 5x \cdot a = 5ax \).

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts from Joe, Kamala, and Alba:
\[
6x + 3kx + 5ax
\]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Therefore, we have:
\[
L + 6x + 3kx + 5ax = 80
\]

However, we don't have enough information to determine the values of \( k \) and \( a \), so we need to make an assumption or find another way to solve the problem. Since the problem doesn't provide specific amounts for \( k \) and \( a \), let's assume that the total amount from mowing lawns is equal to the amount Joe paid, which is $6, as the problem doesn't specify any other payments.

Thus, the total amount from mowing lawns is $6, and the rest of the $80 must come from lemonade sales:
\[
L = 80 - 6 = 74

   - Let the number of notebooks Martha initially had be \( x \).
   - Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3x \) notebooks.

2. **Martha's Purchase:**
   - Martha bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     x + 5 = 7
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \), we subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 7 - 5 = 2
     \]
   - So, Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

3. **Joseph's Initial Count:**
   - Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha initially, he had:
     \[
     3x = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - Joseph initially had 6 notebooks.

4. **Current Situation:**
   - Martha now has 7 notebooks.
   - Joseph still has 6 notebooks (since there is no indication that Joseph's number of notebooks changed).

5. **Comparison:**
   - To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph now, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has:
     \[
     7 - 6 = 1

   - Therefore, the number of packages he completes per hour is \(50 - 10 = 40\) packages.

2. **Calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday:**
   - If Colby completes 40 packages per hour, then in an eight-hour workday, he completes:
   \[
   40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the day:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for 320 packages are:
   \[
   320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

1. **Calculate the time for a normal sudoku:**
   - A normal sudoku takes John 45 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time for an extreme sudoku:**
   - An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku.
   - Therefore, the time for an extreme sudoku is \(4 \times 45\) minutes.
   - \(4 \times 45 = 180\) minutes.

3. **Determine how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes (half an hour).
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, divide 180 by 30.
   - \(180 \div 30 = 6\).

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- \( r = 20 \) (since there are 20 red balloons).
- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation for the total pieces of bologna thrown can be set up as follows:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

Substituting \( r = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ y = 6 \]

Thus, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

1. **Cost of the cake:** $11

2. **Cost of the balloons:**
   - 1 dozen balloons means 12 balloons.
   - The cost is $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3
     \]
   - So, the cost of the balloons is $3.

3. **Cost of the ice cream:**
   - They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream is:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

Now, let's calculate the total expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of the cake + Cost of the balloons + Cost of the ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to make these purchases, the total amount of money they had together was $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each received:

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \),
- Paul's age as \( Pa \),
- Jean's age as \( J \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. This can be written as:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age. This can be written as:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( P = 2J + 10 \) and \( Pa = J + 10 \) into equation (1):
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( Pa \) using equation (2):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we find \( P \) using equation (3):
\[
P = Pa + J = 30 + 20 = 50

   - Maria's friends: 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons
   - Maria: 1 balloon

   Total initial balloons = 8 (friends) + 1 (Maria) = 9 balloons

2. **Additional Balloons from Maria's Mom:**
   - Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons.
   - There are 5 people, so the total additional balloons = 5 people × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

3. **Total Balloons:**
   - Add the initial balloons and the additional balloons:
   - Total balloons = 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24 balloons

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls have is 24.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- Produces 60 widgets per hour.
- Runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.

The total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month is:
\[
60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets}
\]

**WidgetMaster 9000:**
- Produces 45 widgets per hour.
- Runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.

The total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month is:
\[
45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 32,400 \, \text{widgets}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

**Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
\[
43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 \, \text{dollars/widget} = 259,200 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours.
   - From 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the total duration of his stay is 12 + 5 = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay plus additional hours option:**
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 5 hours, the cost is 70 pesos per hour.
   - Additional cost for 5 hours = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for this option = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

4. **Determine the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay plus additional hours
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, by choosing the 12-hour stay plus additional hours option, Cameron saves 250 pesos.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of points Bahati scored,
- \( A \) as the number of points Azibo scored,
- \( D \) as the number of points Dinar scored.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   B = D + 10

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

Substitute \( B = A + 20 \) into equation 1:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
Simplify:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}

Substitute \( B = D + 10 \) into equation 1:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45

Simplify:

A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtract 10 from both sides:

A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we have two new equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (Equation 4)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (Equation 5)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's solve for \( D \) in terms of \( A \) from Equation 4:
\[
D = 25 - 2A
\]

Substitute \( D = 25 - 2A \) into Equation 5:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Simplify:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtract 50 from both sides:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Divide by -3:

A = 5

3. **Calculating the number of sheets of paper**: Since the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, we calculate the total number of sheets of paper as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of sheets} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages per inch} = 150 \, \text{sheets}
   \]

4. **Pages per sheet**: Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book on each side. Therefore, each sheet of paper contains 2 pages of the book.

5. **Calculating the total number of pages in the book**: Since each sheet contains 2 pages, the total number of pages in the book is:
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{sheets} \times 2 \, \text{pages per sheet} = 300 \, \text{pages}
   \]

Thus, the book contains 300 pages.

952,"To determine how many reports Vince stapled altogether, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. **Calculate the total time spent stapling:**

   Vince started stapling at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. We need to find the total number of hours between these two times.

   - From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (noon) is 4 hours.
   - From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours.

   Adding these together gives:

   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 11 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Convert hours to minutes:**

   Since Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes:

   \[
   15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of 15-minute intervals:**

   Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes per interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled:**

   Vince staples 30 reports per interval. Therefore, the total number of reports he staples is:

   \[
   60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports per interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}

955,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, given the current occupancy and the rate of new patient admissions.

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied beds initially is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
     \]
   - The number of unoccupied beds initially is:
     \[
     1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds}
     \]

2. **Patient Admissions:**
   - Each day, 50 new patients are admitted to the hospital.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is:
     \[
     50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients}
     \]

3. **Final Occupancy:**
   - After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of new patients:

Courtney reported that the audience was 48 people. According to Kelly, this number is 20% more than the actual number of attendees. Let's denote the actual number of attendees as \( x \).

If 48 is 20% more than the actual number, we can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( x \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Therefore, Jason carried \( 2x \) balls.

It is also given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Therefore, Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) balls.

The problem states that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we have:

1. On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of each day:

- At the end of the first day: 10 holes.
- At the end of the second day: \(10 + 13 = 23\) holes.
- At the end of the third day: \(23 + 6 = 29\) holes.

According to the problem, by the time they found the treasure on the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes.

Therefore, by the time they found the treasure, there were 40 holes. Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Thus, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- \( W \) as the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]

Simplify:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Now substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W = 40 \), substitute back to find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

   - Distance traveled = speed × time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles south.

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird turns and flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - The bird changes direction again and flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled = speed × time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles south.

Now, we calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:

- Total distance traveled south = 300 miles (first leg) + 110 miles (third leg) = 410 miles.
- Distance traveled north = 36 miles (second leg).

The net distance traveled south is the total distance south minus the distance north:

972,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges:**
   Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:
   \[
   12 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 240 \text{ oranges}
   \]

2. **Determine how many boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away:**
   Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. In total, she gave away:
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of oranges given away:**
   Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges given away is:
   \[
   4 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 80 \text{ oranges}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington has left:**
   After giving away 80 oranges, Mrs. Harrington has:
   \[
   240 \text{ oranges} - 80 \text{ oranges} = 160 \text{ oranges}
   \]

5. **Determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington kept:**
   Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges she kept is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 160 \text{ oranges} = 40 \text{ oranges}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold:**
   The number of oranges she sold is the remaining oranges after keeping some for herself:
   \[
   160 \text{ oranges} - 40 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges}

First, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. We are also told that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20. \]

Now, we know that Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know the total number of cherries is 60, and we have already determined the number of cherries Richard and Robert have. Therefore, we can find the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the sum of Richard's and Robert's cherries from the total number of cherries:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10. \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Finally, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20. \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday.**

- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. We don't know yet how many boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday, so we'll come back to this.

**Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Sunday.**

- On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Since he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, he sold \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.**

- Since Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and he sold 15 boxes on Sunday, he sold \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

**Step 4: Calculate the earnings for each day.**

- **Saturday's earnings:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes at $6 each = \(10 \times 6 = 60\) dollars.
  - Apple pie: 11 boxes at $15 each = \(11 \times 15 = 165\) dollars.
  - Total earnings on Saturday = \(60 + 165 = 225\) dollars.

- **Sunday's earnings:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes at $6 each = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) dollars.
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes at $15 each = \(15 \times 15 = 225\) dollars.
  - Total earnings on Sunday = \(90 + 225 = 315\) dollars.

**Step 5: Calculate the total earnings for both days.**

- Total earnings for both days = Saturday's earnings + Sunday's earnings = \(225 + 315 = 540\) dollars.

   - We are given that the price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Price of the Red Car:**
   - The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. This means the red car costs 40% less than the blue car.
   - To find out how much cheaper the red car is, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price.
   - 40% of $100 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.40 \times 100 = 40

991,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Bill and his father when they saw Comet Halley.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( x \) be the age of Bill when he first saw the comet.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet at age 30, so the comet appeared again 75 years later.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it, which is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Calculating Bill's Age:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet for the second time at age 90, and the comet appears every 75 years, he must have seen it for the first time 75 years before he was 90.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he first saw the comet is \( 90 - 75 = 15 \).

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas Bill**: Similarly, Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Therefore, he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church Donations**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Thus, he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes one check every quarter for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}

First, let's find out how many flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane:

\[ \text{Number of trips by the first plane} = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now that we know the first plane makes 88 trips in a day, we can determine how these trips are distributed among the destinations.

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[ \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. First, we calculate the number of remaining flights:

\[ \text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22 \]

These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro's age: \( B = 4 \)
- Helene's age: \( H \)
- Wilfred's age: \( W \)

We are given that the total age of the children is 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
A + B + H + W = 20
\]

Substituting the known values for Akbar and Alessandro, we have:
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]

Simplifying this equation gives:
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we find:
\[
H + W = 13

Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we have:

H = 2 \times 5 = 10

Now that we know Helene's age, we can substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):

Let's denote the size of the slice each kid gets as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices in terms of \( x \) is:
- For the 4 kids: \( 4 \times x = 4x \)
- For the 2 adults: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of all these slices:

  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did on the first day. Therefore, the amount of water Ms. B pumped is:

1. The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
2. After that, it loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
3. At the end of these 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28% of the total capacity.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \% \).

**Step 1: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours.**

Each hour, the power bank loses 9% of its total capacity. Therefore, after 5 hours, it loses:

\[ 5 \times 9\% = 45\% \]

So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:

\[ x - 45\% \]

**Step 2: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours.**

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, over these 3 hours, it loses:

\[ 3 \times 7\% = 21\% \]

So, the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:

\[ (x - 45\%) - 21\% = x - 66\% \]

**Step 3: Set up the equation for the final charge.**

We know that after 8 hours, the remaining charge is 28% of the total capacity. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x - 66\% = 28\% \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \).**

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x - 66\% = 28\% \]

Add 66% to both sides:

\[ x = 28\% + 66\% \]

\[ x = 94\% \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was 94%.

   \[
   10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per week:**

   Janet works 40 hours a week. Therefore, her total earnings per week are:

1. **Cost of Peaches:**
   - Jamaar bought 3 peaches.
   - Each peach costs $0.5.
   - Total cost for peaches = 3 peaches × $0.5/peach = $1.5.

2. **Cost of Pears:**
   - Jamaar bought 4 pears.
   - Each pear costs $0.5.
   - Total cost for pears = 4 pears × $0.5/pear = $2.0.

3. **Cost of Kiwis:**
   - Jamaar bought 2 kiwis.
   - Each kiwi costs $1.
   - Total cost for kiwis = 2 kiwis × $1/kiwi = $2.0.

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Jamaar bought 5 apples.
   - Each apple costs $0.75.
   - Total cost for apples = 5 apples × $0.75/apple = $3.75.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the fruits he has already purchased:

- Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of pears + Cost of kiwis + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased from the $10:

- Money left = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the money left by the cost of one plum:

- Number of plums = $0.75 ÷ $0.25/plum = 3 plums

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums with the money he has left.

- Let \( y \) be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.

We know from the problem statement that:

1. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so each large stuffed animal costs \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( x = 2y \).

1. **Red Balloons:**
   - Sally initially had 25 red balloons.
   - 40% of the red balloons burst due to the wind.
   - Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10.
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15.

2. **Green Balloons:**
   - Sally had 7 green balloons.
   - There was no change in the number of green balloons.
   - Remaining green balloons = 7.

3. **Yellow Balloons:**
   - Sally initially had 12 yellow balloons.
   - She accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.
   - Number of yellow balloons released = 12 / 2 = 6.
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6.

4. **Blue Balloons:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons in a tree.
   - She added 75% of them to her collection.
   - Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6.

Now, we add up all the remaining balloons Sally carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.

1030,"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he might not have to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present, and in this case, the homework will not be collected. Therefore, there's a 50% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - If the normal teacher is present, which happens with a 50% chance (since there's a 50% chance of a substitute), we need to consider the following:
     - There's a 40% chance the teacher will give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension.
     - If no class-wide extension is given, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher to give him a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher:** 0% (since homework is not collected with a substitute).
- **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:**
  - Probability that the normal teacher is present: 50%
  - Probability that no class-wide extension is given: 60%
  - Probability that Marcus does not get a personal extension: 80%

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework with the normal teacher is calculated by multiplying these probabilities:

\[ 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24 \]

So, there's a 24% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present.

Finally, since there's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher (where he doesn't have to turn in homework), and a 24% chance of having to turn it in with the normal teacher, the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 0.24 \]

Converting this to a percentage, we get 24%.

1. **Calculate the total loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the lost income:**
   Jim was earning $25,000 per year before college. Over 4 years, he loses:
   \[
   \text{Lost income} = 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of education:**
   The total cost includes both the loans and the lost income:
   \[

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person. Therefore, the share of the second person is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took. Therefore, the share of the third person is \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount divided among the three people:

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

According to the problem:
1. In the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).
2. In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can now set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
4x + x + 8 = 38

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

- \( r = 0.21 \) (depreciation rate),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
\]

Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

Now raise 0.79 to the power of 3:

\[
0.79^3 = 0.493039

Now calculate the depreciated value:

\[
V = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78

According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's time can be expressed as \( x + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal preparation was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + (x + 18) = 98
\]

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms:

Then, divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):

The cost of one pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost of two pounds of butter under the promotion is calculated as follows:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Thus, the total cost for two pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can divide the 6 pounds into three sets of two pounds each. For each set of two pounds, he will pay $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
3 sets of 2 pounds × $6.00 per set = $18.00.

1071,"To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to calculate the total number of guests attending and then apply the theater's pricing structure.

1. **Calculate the total number of invited guests:**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - Additionally, she invited 13 family members.

   Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45 guests.

2. **Determine the number of guests attending:**
   - Out of the 45 invited guests, 4 people said they could not come.

   Total attending guests = 45 (invited) - 4 (not coming) = 41 guests.

3. **Calculate the cost of the party:**
   - The theater rental fee covers a party of up to 20 guests for $125.
   - For each additional guest beyond the initial 20, there is an extra charge of $6.

   Number of additional guests = 41 (attending) - 20 (covered by base fee) = 21 additional guests.

   Additional cost = 21 (additional guests) × $6 = $126.

   Total cost = Base fee ($125) + Additional cost ($126) = $251.

1072,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left after spending part of their money.

First, let's calculate how much money Maggie spent. Maggie had $60 initially and spent a quarter of it. A quarter of $60 is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Amount Maggie spent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
\]

So, Maggie spent $15. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount she spent from her initial amount:

\[
\text{Maggie's remaining money} = 60 - 15 = 45
\]

Next, let's calculate how much money Riza spent. Riza also had $60 initially and spent one-third of it. One-third of $60 is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Amount Riza spent} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Riza spent $20. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount she spent from her initial amount:

\[
\text{Riza's remaining money} = 60 - 20 = 40
\]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money both Maggie and Riza have left. We do this by adding the remaining amounts of both individuals:

\[
\text{Total remaining money} = \text{Maggie's remaining money} + \text{Riza's remaining money} = 45 + 40 = 85
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is $85.

First, let's calculate how many bananas the first monkey eats each day. According to the problem, the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

Next, we determine how many bananas the second monkey eats each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \]
bananas each day.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. We know that the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day is the total number of bananas divided by the number of days in a week. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, and a week has 7 days, the total number of bananas eaten each day by all three monkeys is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \]
bananas per day.

The first and second monkeys together eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \]
bananas each day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas each day, which is:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \]

First, let's calculate how many seconds are in 4 hours:

1 hour = 60 minutes  
1 minute = 60 seconds  
Therefore, 1 hour = 60 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds.

So, 4 hours = 4 × 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds.

Now, since each spring creates one jellyfish per second, one spring would create 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Since there are 5 springs, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5:

14400 jellyfish/spring × 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch averages 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:

\[
10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought these 40 bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[
40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}

   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
   \]

   So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.

2. **Calculate the total earnings:** The orchard sells each bag for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
   \]

Therefore, the orchard earned a total of $1000 from selling the apples.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining weight is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
   The remaining weight after the velociraptors is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is equal to the remaining weight:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

To find the initial weight \( x \), solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Thus, the initial weight of the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = width × height = 10 feet × 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - There are two such walls (north and south), so the total area for these walls is 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = width × height = 5 feet × 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - There are two such walls (east and west), so the total area for these walls is 2 × 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. **Calculate the total area to be painted:**
   - Total area = area of north and south walls + area of east and west walls
   - Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

4. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = total area / coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
   - Each gallon of paint costs $12.
   - Total cost = number of gallons × cost per gallon = 12 gallons × $12 per gallon = $144.

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

- April 19th is the 19th day of April.

So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is:
\[ 31 \text{ (days in March)} + 19 \text{ (days in April)} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50 days:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph.
   - It takes him 2 hours to reach his parents' house.
   - Distance is calculated using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.
   - Therefore, the one-way distance to his parents' house is: 
     \[
     70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - A round trip means traveling to his parents' house and back.

First, let's calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in seven days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Therefore, in 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. This means that the distance Sofie walks is twice the distance Brian walks. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

We know that Sofie walks 70 miles, so we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

To find the distance Brian walks, we need to solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

First, let's calculate how many toys the first four workers produce in total during their 10-hour shift:

1. The first two workers each produce 6 toys per hour. Therefore, in 10 hours, each of these two workers produces:
   \[
   6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys}
   \]
   So, together, these two workers produce:
   \[
   2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. The next two workers each produce 4 toys per hour. Therefore, in 10 hours, each of these two workers produces:
   \[
   4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys}
   \]
   So, together, these two workers produce:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

Adding the toys produced by these four workers, we get:
\[
120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

The total order is for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means that 380 toys have been produced in total by all five workers.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining:
\[
380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
\]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
\]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is 18.

- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56: \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the total equation:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

We also have the equations:
\[ C + S = 30 \]
\[ C = S + 12 \]

Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Now we know:
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.

\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

   \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**

   Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find the time spent on the sidewalk, we use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**

   The total time for Grandma's walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

   \[
   \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes}

1. **Calculate the amount Jane has already saved:**
   Jane saves $4 every week. She has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount she has saved so far is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much more she needs to save:**
   Jane wants to have a total of $60. She has already saved $32. Therefore, the additional amount she needs to save is:
   \[
   60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more weeks it will take:**
   Jane continues to save $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save $28, we divide the additional amount needed by the amount she saves per week:
   \[
   \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}

1. **Determine the initial number of marbles Bob has:**

   We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. A dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.

   Let \(x\) be the initial number of marbles Bob has. According to the problem, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can write this as an equation:

   \[
   x + 24 = 60
   \]

   To find \(x\), we solve the equation by subtracting 24 from both sides:

   \[
   x = 60 - 24
   \]

   \[
   x = 36
   \]

   So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

2. **Calculate the number of marbles after losing 10:**

   Now that we know Bob initially has 36 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have \(\boxed{26}\) marbles.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
1137,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that when mixed with the water from the first mug, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees (temperature of the first mug)
- \( T_2 \) as the unknown temperature of the second mug
- \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces (volume of water taken from the first mug)
- \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce (volume of water taken from the second mug)

The total volume of the mixture is \( V_1 + V_2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The condition for Donny to drink the water is that the average temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. The average temperature \( T_{\text{avg}} \) of the mixture can be calculated using the formula for the weighted average:

\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{5}
\]

We need \( T_{\text{avg}} \geq 40 \). Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**

   Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00/\text{pack} = \$40.00
   \]

2. **Apply the 10% discount:**

   A 10% discount on \$40.00 is calculated as:
   \[
   0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00
   \]

   Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00

   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Calculation: \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for the scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - First, calculate the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops (since 1 less than 3 is 2):
     - Calculation: \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes for 2 scoops.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes are needed per scoop.
   - Calculate the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:

1158,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of carrot juice are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

First, let's understand the energy coverage provided by one bottle of juice. Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need:

\[ \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles per person} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each person requires 5 bottles, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles per person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total requirement:

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles needed} - 4200 \text{ bottles produced} = 7300 \text{ additional bottles needed} \]

First, let's break down the information given:

1. Carla has identical octuplets, which means there are 8 babies in total.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple. Therefore, the number of babies in purple is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
   \]
3. 1/4 of them are dressed in blue. Therefore, the number of babies in blue is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
   \]

Next, let's determine how many babies are wearing bows:

1. All the blue-wearers wear bows. So, the number of blue-wearers with bows is 2.
2. 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows. Therefore, the number of purple-wearers with bows is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
   \]

Now, we calculate the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[
2 \text{ (blue-wearers with bows)} + 2 \text{ (purple-wearers with bows)} = 4
\]

Finally, we find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the ratio of purple-wearers with bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination of the bills:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills on his way home. Therefore, the number of $20 bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Paying a Bill:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Tripling His Money:**
   Each of the remaining 20 bills is worth $20, so the total amount of money he has is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Thomas then triples his money:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the denomination of the bills:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}

**First Half:**

- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. Therefore, Team B scores:
  \[
  4 - 2 = 2 \text{ goals}
  \]

**Second Half:**

- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half it scores:
  \[
  4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ goals}

1176,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk at a rate of 20% per day before it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The piece of chalk is initially 5 inches long.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk was used, we calculate:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, 2.25 inches of chalk were used on Monday.

3. **Chalk Remaining After Monday**: Subtract the used chalk from the initial length:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, 2.75 inches of chalk remain after Monday.

4. **Daily Chalk Usage**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. Calculate 20% of the remaining chalk:
   \[
   0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches per day}
   \]

5. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling**: The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days he can use the chalk before it reaches this length.

   Start with 2.75 inches and subtract 0.55 inches each day until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
   - After 1 day: \(2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20\) inches
   - After 2 days: \(2.20 - 0.55 = 1.65\) inches

   After 2 days, the chalk will be 1.65 inches long, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it needs to be recycled.

Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

1. **First piece of information:**
   - Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - Seven years from now, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).
   - Therefore, Wendy's age is \( W = 5(C + 7) \).

2. **Second piece of information:**
   - In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
   - Wendy's current age is \( W \), so \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

**Step 1: Solve the first equation for \( W \):**
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35 \]

**Step 2: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

**Step 3: Simplify the second equation:**
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C}{3} + \frac{35}{3} \]

Multiply every term by 3 to eliminate the fractions:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]

Expand the left side:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( C \):**
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin is currently 20 years old.

**Verification:**

- If Colin is 20 now, in 7 years, he will be 27. Wendy is 5 times 27, which is 135. So, Wendy is 135 years old now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be 45. A third of Wendy's current age (135) is 45, which matches.

- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is:
  \[
  6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese pizza slices}

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:

- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is:

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For cheese pizzas:

- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}

   - Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour. This means he makes \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) snowballs per minute.

2. **Snowball Melting Rate:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs melt per minute.

3. **Net Snowball Rate:**
   - The net rate at which Jay accumulates snowballs is the production rate minus the melting rate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}

   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. Convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}

   So, Jay accumulates snowballs at a net rate of \( \frac{1}{5} \) snowballs per minute.

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how long it takes to reach 60 snowballs, divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate:

2. John is currently 28 years old.

Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, we can calculate John's age at that time:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.

2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80

First, let's calculate the number of red pens. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. According to the problem, Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 5 packs of red pens, she bought twice that amount in black pen packs:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

1. **Cost per bottle of scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost per bottle of cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - 50% more than $60 is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Number of bottles of cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does scotch.
   - Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
     \]

4. **Total cost of cognac:**
   - The total cost for the cognac is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total expenditure:**
   - The total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac is the sum of the total costs for each:

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is:
  \[
  2 \times 20 = 40
  \]

**Second Day:**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. Therefore, the number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is:
  \[
  20 + 10 = 30
  \]
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:

We are given that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. We need to find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x \).

Eight more than this amount is represented by the expression \( 4x + 8 \).

We are told that this expression equals 40. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

   \[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]

   \[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

   \[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]

   \[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan is responsible for the remaining diaper changes. Thus, Jordan changes:

\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes/day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

Therefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is 5.

1215,"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the number of red jelly beans he would estimate based on the given information and then compare it to the true number of red jelly beans.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**

   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans:**

   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) available for the jelly beans is:

   \[
   V_{\text{eff}} = 0.8 \times 540 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**

   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the effective volume is:

   \[
   N = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**

   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:

   \[
   N_{\text{red}} = 0.3 \times 2880 = 864
   \]

5. **Calculate how far off Tim's guess was:**

   The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = |900 - 864| = 36

1. **First 5 Years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost per visit is $2.
   - Over 5 years, the total number of visits is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) visits.
   - The total cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Price Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - A 150% increase on $2 is calculated as follows:
     - 150% of $2 is \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) dollars.
     - Therefore, the new cost per visit is \(2 + 3 = 5\) dollars.

3. **Next 3 Years:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year.
   - The new cost per visit is $5.
   - Over 3 years, the total number of visits is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) visits.
   - The total cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = 45\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**

According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is 40 feet, and this is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 4x = 40

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
x = \frac{40}{5} = 8

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes can be expressed as \( 5x - 4 \).

We are also told that the total number of ice cubes is 116. This means the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes is 116. We can write this relationship as an equation:

\[
x + (5x - 4) = 116
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
x + 5x - 4 = 116
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
6x - 4 = 116
\]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
6x = 120
\]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 20
\]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes. We use the expression for the number of blueberry cubes, which is \( 5x - 4 \):

\[
5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final result is:

1. **Identify the cost of the main phone:**
   - The main phone costs $20.

2. **Determine the cost of each additional phone:**
   - The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs half of the main phone's cost.
   - Cost of each additional phone = $20 / 2 = $10.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all phones:**
   - There are five phones in total: one main phone and four additional phones.
   - Total cost for the main phone = $20.
   - Total cost for the additional phones = 4 additional phones × $10 per additional phone = $40.

4. **Add the costs together:**
   - Total cost of the phone plan = Cost of the main phone + Total cost of the additional phones.
   - Total cost of the phone plan = $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60.

First, let's calculate the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page contains 450 words, and there are 10 pages, so the total number of words is:

\[ 450 \text{ words/page} \times 10 \text{ pages} = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find John's new speaking speed after his training. His original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster. Therefore, his new speaking speed is:

\[ 150 \text{ WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we need to calculate how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at this new speed of 375 WPM. The time taken to speak a certain number of words is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} \]

2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
3. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

Let \( r \) represent the number of red blocks. According to the problem, the total number of blocks is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + r \text{ (red blocks)} = 32

1. **Initial Group of Children:**
   - At the end of the first street, there are 5 children following the ice cream truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. This means each child is now paired with one additional child.
   - Therefore, the number of children doubles: \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

3. **Third Street:**
   - On the third street, each child in the group of 10 is joined by another 2 children.
   - This means each child is now in a group of 3 (the original child plus 2 more).

1304,"To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, we calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students every year.

Next, we find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from that at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
4000 - 3000 = 1000

4. **Total Items on the Lab Bench:**
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Petri dishes: 16
- Beakers: Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench.

The equation for the total number of items is:
\[
8 + 16 + x = 29
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
24 + x = 29
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 29 - 24 = 5
\]

Igor placed 5 beakers on the lab bench. Since he originally picked up 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - 5 = 2

First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances:

1. **Aaron's Speed and Distance:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

2. **Vanessa's Speed and Distance:**
   - Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.

Let's denote:
- \( v_A \) as Aaron's speed in miles per minute.
- \( v_V \) as Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we have:
\[ v_A = 2v_V \]

Now, let's calculate Aaron's distance:
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
- Let \( d_A \) be the distance Aaron ran in miles.

The formula for distance is:
\[ d_A = v_A \times \text{time} \]

Given that Aaron's time is 16 minutes, we have:
\[ d_A = v_A \times 16 \]

Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron:
\[ d_V = 2d_A \]

We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, so:
\[ d_V = 4 \]

Thus:
\[ 2d_A = 4 \]
\[ d_A = 2 \]

Now, we know Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, Aaron's speed \( v_A \) is:
\[ v_A = \frac{d_A}{\text{time}} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since \( v_A = 2v_V \), we have:
\[ 2v_V = \frac{1}{8} \]
\[ v_V = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles:
\[ \text{time}_V = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{4}{v_V} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( w \) as the number of cows.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. We can write the following equations based on this information:

1. \( c + w = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2c + 4w = 70 \) (since the total number of legs is 70)

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Let's start with the first equation:

\[ c + w = 20 \]

We can express \( w \) in terms of \( c \):

\[ w = 20 - c \]

Now, substitute \( w = 20 - c \) into the second equation:

\[ 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70 \]

Distribute the 4:

\[ 2c + 80 - 4c = 70 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ -2c + 80 = 70 \]

Subtract 80 from both sides:

\[ -2c = 70 - 80 \]

\[ -2c = -10 \]

Divide both sides by -2:

\[ c = 5 \]
