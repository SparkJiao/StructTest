The trains travel westward for 80 miles on the first day.

### 2. Identify the Distance Covered on the Second Day
The trains travel northwards for 150 miles on the second day.

### 3. Calculate the Total Distance Covered by Each Train
To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on both days.

### 4. Add the Distances Covered on Both Days
Total distance = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

### 5. Consider the Direction of Travel
Since the trains travel in two different directions (west and north), we cannot simply add the distances to find the total distance between the starting and ending points. However, the question asks for the distance covered by each train, not the distance between the starting and ending points.

### 6. Realize That the Direction Does Not Affect the Total Distance Covered
The direction of travel does not affect the total distance covered by each train. The distance covered is a scalar quantity and does not depend on the direction.

### 7. Confirm That the Calculation Is Correct
We have correctly calculated the total distance covered by each train by adding the distances covered on both days.

**Step 2** Calculate the total hours Jill works as a coach in a year.
To find the total hours Jill works as a coach in a year, we multiply the hours she works per week as a coach (15 hours) by the number of weeks she works in a year (50 weeks).
Total hours as a coach = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year


**Step 3** Calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher.
To find Jill's annual salary as a teacher, we multiply the total hours she works as a teacher in a year (1750 hours) by her hourly wage as a teacher ($20/hour).
Annual salary as a teacher = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

The total distance of Henry's bike trip is 60 miles.

## Step 2. Identify the distance traveled before the first stop
Henry stopped after 20 miles, so the distance traveled before the first stop is 20 miles.

## Step 3. Identify the distance remaining after the first stop
The distance remaining after the first stop is the total distance minus the distance traveled before the first stop, which is 60 - 20 = 40 miles.

## Step 4. Identify the distance traveled before the second stop
Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so the distance traveled before the second stop is the distance remaining after the first stop minus 15 miles, which is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

## Step 5. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops
The distance traveled between the first and second stops is the distance traveled before the second stop, which is 25 miles.

=============================================

1. Let's Represent Darrell's and Allen's Ages as Variables
--------------------------------------------------------

* Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant multiplier.


2. Set Up an Equation Based on the Total Age
---------------------------------------------

* The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.


3. Solve for x
----------------

* Combine like terms: 18x = 162.
* Divide both sides by 18: x = 9.


4. Calculate Allen's Current Age
---------------------------------

* Allen's age is 11x, so Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.


5. Calculate Allen's Age 10 Years from Now

Since Sophia needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank after traveling 100 miles, we can assume that the 4 gallons were consumed during those 100 miles.


2. Calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of Sophia's car.
To do this, we divide the total miles traveled (100 miles) by the total gallons consumed (4 gallons).

mpg = total miles / total gallons = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles/gallon


3. Determine the total capacity of Sophia's gas tank.
According to the owner's manual, Sophia's gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas.


4. Calculate the total miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.
To do this, we multiply the total capacity of the gas tank (12 gallons) by the miles per gallon (25 miles/gallon).

Let's break down the problem step by step.


1. Define the variables for the problem
* Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L.


2. Set up the equation based on the given information
* We know that the team played 22 games in total. Since they either won or lost each game, the total number of games won and lost should add up to 22: W + L = 22.
* We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost: W = L + 8.


3. Solve the system of equations
* We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for L: (L + 8) + L = 22.
* Combine like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.
* Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.


4. Find the number of games won
* Now that we know L = 7, we can substitute this value back into the equation W = L + 8 to find W: W = 7 + 8 = 15.

88,"1. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H and the number of copies Marilyn sold as M.
 

2. We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so we can express this relationship as M = 10H.

3. We also know that they sold 88,000 copies combined, which can be expressed as M + H = 88,000.

4. Now, we can substitute the expression for M from step 2 into the equation from step 3, giving us 10H + H = 88,000.

5. Combining like terms, we get 11H = 88,000.

6. To find the value of H, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 11.

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her run into two parts: 
* The first part where she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
* The second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

### 2
First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first 3 hours:
* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
* Distance = 30 miles

### 3
Next, we need to find out how much time is left after the first 3 hours:
* Total time = 7 hours
* Time left = Total time - 3 hours
* Time left = 7 hours - 3 hours
* Time left = 4 hours

### 4
Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:
* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
* Distance = 20 miles

### 5
Finally, we add the distances covered in both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

5. Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie puts stamps on 20 letters.


6. To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters initially, we need to subtract the 20 letters that Jennie stamped from the total of 30.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total time spent by doctors, we multiply the number of patients by the average time spent per patient.
Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes


### 2. Convert the total time spent by doctors from minutes to hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total time spent by doctors in minutes by 60 to get the total time in hours.
Total time spent by doctors = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours


### 3. Calculate the total cost charged by doctors to the hospital
The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital. To find the total cost charged by doctors, we multiply the total time spent by doctors in hours by their hourly rate.

2. We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so we can express this relationship as B = 2Q.

 

3. Since W = 2B and B = 2Q, we can substitute B in the first equation with 2Q to get W = 2(2Q), which simplifies to W = 4Q.

 

4. We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can set up the equation Q + B + W = 700.

 

5. Substituting B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the equation Q + B + W = 700, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, which simplifies to 7Q = 700.

 

6. Solving for Q, we get Q = 700 / 7 = 100.

 

7. Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives us B = 2(100) = 200.

 

8. Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives us W = 2(200) = 400.

To compare the time it takes for Steve and Tim to get home, we need to convert their distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.


**Step 2. Calculate Steve's Distance in Feet**
Steve lives 3 miles from school, so we multiply 3 miles by 5280 feet/mile to get Steve's distance in feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet.


**Step 3. Calculate Tim's Distance in Feet**
Tim lives 2 miles from school, so we multiply 2 miles by 5280 feet/mile to get Tim's distance in feet: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.


**Step 4. Calculate Steve's Time**
Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so we divide Steve's distance in feet by his speed to get his time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.


**Step 5. Calculate Tim's Time**
Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so we divide Tim's distance in feet by his speed to get his time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.


**Step 6. Determine the Winner and Loser**
Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner and Tim is the loser.


**Step 7. Calculate the Waiting Time**
To find out how long the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house before the loser (Tim) finishes the race, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time: 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

### 2. Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month.
In the first month, Elaine collected three times the initial number of cards. 
So, she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards.


### 3. Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the second month.
In the second month, Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. 
So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.


### 4. Calculate the combined number of cards Elaine collected in the first and second months.
The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.


### 5. Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the third month.
In the third month, Elaine collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. 
So, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.


### 6. Calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now.
The total number of cards Elaine has now is the sum of the initial cards and the cards collected in each month. 
So, the total number of cards is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

* Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.
* We know that W = R + 2, since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

### 2. Calculate the total number of eggs produced per day
* Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is 3R.
* White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is 5W.
* Since W = R + 2, we can substitute this into the equation for the total number of eggs from white chickens: 5(R + 2).

### 3. Set up the equation for the total number of eggs collected per day
* Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so we can set up the equation: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.
* Simplify the equation: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

### 4. Solve the equation for R
* Combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42.
* Subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32.

It takes half as many days to travel by car, so it takes 6 / 2 = 3 days to travel by car.


3. Since Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to add the number of days for each trip.
The total number of days for the round trip is 6 days (to Rochester by bus) + 3 days (return from Rochester by car).

To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide.

### 2
Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of Mitchel's total.

* Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
* 30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9.

### 3
Now we subtract 30% of Mitchel's total from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total.

* Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

### 4
Since Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply Anne's total by 4.

* Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

### 2
* Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.
* To find out how many cows each stall gets, we divide the new cows by the total number of stalls.
* New cows per stall = 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall.

### 3
* Now, let's calculate the total number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows.
* Each stall already had 20 cows, and 10 stalls get 2 new cows each, while the other 10 stalls get 2 new cows each as well.
* Total cows per stall = 20 cows/stall + 2 cows/stall = 22 cows/stall.

### 4
* We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls.
* Since each stall has 22 cows, we multiply the number of stalls by the number of cows per stall.

Substituting R = 6S into the equation R + 9 = 3(S + 9) gives us 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).


### Step 6. Expand and simplify the equation from Step 5
Expanding the equation gives us 6S + 9 = 3S + 27. Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us 3S + 9 = 27. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us 3S = 18.


### Step 7. Solve for S
Dividing both sides of the equation 3S = 18 by 3 gives us S = 6.


### Step 8. Verify the solution (optional)
We can verify our solution by checking if it satisfies both original equations.

To find the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones in the necklace.

### 2
Since each topaz gemstone is one inch long and there are 8 gemstones per necklace, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

### 3
Next, we need to find the remaining length of the necklace that will be filled with sterling silver beads. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

### 4
So, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

### 5
Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we need to divide the remaining length by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

### 6
To divide 17 inches by one-quarter of an inch, we can multiply 17 by 4, since there are 4 quarters in an inch.

### 7
17 * 4 = 68.

### 8
However, this calculation assumes that the sterling silver beads will be placed at the very end of the necklace, but in reality, they will be placed between the topaz gemstones.

### 9
Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, there will be 7 spaces between them, and the sterling silver beads will be placed in these spaces.

### 10
Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads will be the total number of beads (68) divided by the number of spaces between the topaz gemstones, but since the beads are placed between the gemstones, the number of beads will be the same as the number of spaces between the gemstones multiplied by the number of beads in each space.

### 11
However, the above step 10 is incorrect. The correct calculation is simply the total number of beads (68) since the beads are placed between the gemstones and at the ends of the necklace.

To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding pattern and how the pages are arranged.


### 2
When a piece of paper is folded vertically and unfolded, it creates two sides: the front and the back.


### 3
Each side can have multiple pages printed on it, depending on the folding pattern.


### 4
In this case, the pages are arranged in a way that page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front.


### 5
This arrangement suggests that the pages are printed in a continuous sequence, with the front and back sides of each sheet of paper being used.


### 6
Since there are 32 pages in total, and each sheet of paper can have 4 pages printed on it (2 on the front and 2 on the back), we can calculate the number of sheets needed.


### 7
To calculate the number of sheets, we divide the total number of pages (32) by the number of pages that can be printed on each sheet (4).

32 pages / 4 pages per sheet = 8 sheets

However, since each sheet of paper is folded in half, we need to consider that each sheet will produce 2 ""sides"" of the tabloid.

* Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning: 2/3 * 60 = 40 loaves.

### 3
* Now, let's calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales. This can be calculated as 60 - 40.

### 4
* Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales: 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

### 5
* Since half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as 1/2 * 20.

### 6
* Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon: 1/2 * 20 = 10 loaves.

325,"# Calculating Total Programmer Salaries
## Step-by-Step Solution


1. **Determine the Number of Junior Programmers**
The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. Given that there are 100 employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers


2. **Calculate the Number of Senior Programmers**
Since the problem doesn't specify the number of senior programmers, we'll assume the remaining employees are senior programmers. However, we need to note that not all employees are programmers. Let's denote the total number of programmers as P. We know that 40 are junior programmers, but we cannot determine the exact number of senior programmers without knowing the total number of programmers. We'll proceed with the given information.


3. **Determine the Salary of Senior Programmers**
Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Given that junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, we can calculate the salary of senior programmers as follows:
$2000 + $400 = $2400 per month


4. **Calculate the Total Salary of Junior Programmers**
We know that there are 40 junior programmers, each paid $2000 per month. We can calculate their total salary as follows:
40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month


5. **Address the Missing Information**
We realize that we cannot accurately calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers without knowing the total number of programmers or the number of senior programmers. However, we can express the total salary in terms of the number of senior programmers (S). The total salary would be the sum of junior and senior programmers' salaries:
$80,000 + $2400S


6. **Make an Assumption for the Sake of Calculation**
Since we cannot determine the exact number of senior programmers, let's assume that the remaining employees (100 - 40 = 60) are a mix of non-programmers and senior programmers. For the sake of calculation, let's assume that all 60 are senior programmers, which is an overestimation.


7. **Calculate the Total Salary with the Assumption**
Using the assumption from step 6, we can calculate the total salary as follows:
$80,000 + $2400 * 60 = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month


8. **Conclusion**
Please note that the actual total salary might be lower than our calculation, as we overestimated the number of senior programmers.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x.


#### Step 2. Express the number of students in the smallest group
The smallest group has 10 less students than each of the other groups, so the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.


#### Step 3. Set up the equation based on the total number of students
Since there are 200 students in total, the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, the equation is x + x + (x - 10) = 200.


#### Step 4. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms to simplify the equation: 3x - 10 = 200.


#### Step 5. Add 10 to both sides of the equation
To isolate the term with x, add 10 to both sides of the equation: 3x = 210.


#### Step 6. Divide both sides of the equation by 3
To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 70.


#### Step 7. Calculate the number of students in the smallest group
Now that we know x, we can calculate the number of students in the smallest group: x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.

393,"### 1. Calculate the time spent writing the song
Carol spends 4 hours writing a song.

### 2. Calculate the time spent recording the song
She spends half the time recording the song as she did writing it, so she spends 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording the song.

### 3. Calculate the time spent editing the song
Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

### 4. Calculate the total time spent working on the song
Total time spent working on the song is the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

### 5. Calculate the percentage of time spent editing the song
To calculate the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time spent working on the song and multiply by 100: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%.

### 6. Final calculation check
We have calculated the percentage of time spent editing the song.

419,"1. Determine the elevation of Stanley's comb after it fell 4,000 feet.
 
The comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so we need to subtract the distance it fell from its original elevation to find its new elevation.


2. Calculate the new elevation of Stanley's comb.

New elevation = Original elevation - Distance fallen
New elevation = 10,000 - 4,000
New elevation = 6,000 feet


3. Determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

To find this, we need to subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of Stanley's comb.

Kenny spent $100 on the amusement park ticket and had $50 left for spending cash, so he must have earned a total of $100 + $50 = $150.

Since Kenny sold each card for $1.5, we can divide the total amount he earned ($150) by the price per card ($1.5) to find the number of cards he sold: $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards.


**Step 3** Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with.
Kenny kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. Since he sold 100 cards, we can set up the equation: (2/3) × Total cards = 100. To solve for the total number of cards, we can multiply both sides by 3/2: Total cards = 100 × (3/2) = 150.

To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we need to calculate the total points of both Joey and Marcy after their turns.


### 2
Joey initially had 214 points and scored 26 points, so we add these two numbers together to get his new total.


### 3
Marcy initially had 225 points and scored 10 points, so we add these two numbers together to get her new total.


### 4
Now we compare the total points of Joey and Marcy to find out by how many points Joey is winning.


### 5
Joey's new total is 214 + 26 = 240 points.


### 6
Marcy's new total is 225 + 10 = 235 points.


### 7
To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's total from Joey's total.


### 8
The difference between Joey's total and Marcy's total is 240 - 235 = 5 points.


### 9
Since Joey has more points than Marcy, he is winning by 5 points.


### 10
Therefore, Joey is winning by 5 points.

* The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.
* To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers: $576 ÷ 48 = $12 per sneaker.


**Step 2** Calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday
* The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.
* To find the total revenue from the flash sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker: 17 × $20 = $340.


**Step 3** Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store
* The salesman started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 at the flash sale.
* To find the number of sneakers sold to the department store, we subtract the number sold at the flash sale from the total: 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers.


**Step 4** Calculate the revenue from selling sneakers to the department store
* The salesman sold 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each.
* To find the total revenue from the department store, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker: 31 × $25 = $775.


**Step 5** Calculate the total revenue
* The salesman earned $340 from the flash sale and $775 from the department store.
* To find the total revenue, we add the revenue from both sources: $340 + $775 = $1115.

We need to find the regular price of popcorn given that a super ticket costs $20, a regular ticket costs $12, and a soda costs $3. We also know that with the super ticket, a popcorn and a soda cost $1 extra.


**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda
The total cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda is $20 + $1 = $21.


**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda
Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as x. The total cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda is $12 + x + $3.


**Step 4** Understand the relationship between the costs
We know that the person who didn't buy the super ticket ended up saving $2. This means that the total cost of the regular ticket with popcorn and soda is $2 less than the total cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda.


**Step 5** Set up the equation
We can set up the equation: $12 + x + $3 = $21 - $2.


**Step 6** Solve the equation
Simplifying the equation, we get: $15 + x = $19.


**Step 7** Find the value of x
Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get: x = $4.

Let's denote the total number of students as x. We know that 1/4 of the students do not have desktop computers, and this number is given as 20. So, we can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20.


**Step 4** Solve the equation for x
To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to cancel out the fraction: x = 20 * 4.


**Step 5** Calculate the value of x
x = 20 * 4 = 80.

506,"#### Calculating the Total Cost of Snowshoes for Mario's Sled Dogs


1. Determine the number of legs per dog
Each dog has four legs.


2. Calculate the total number of legs for all dogs
Mario has 6 sled dogs, so the total number of legs is 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.


3. Determine the number of legs per pair of snowshoes
Each pair of snowshoes is for 2 legs.


4. Calculate the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed
Since each pair of snowshoes is for 2 legs, the total number of pairs needed is 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.


5. Calculate the total cost of snowshoes
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost is 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

1. **Determine the number of bus trips per week**
Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week.

2. **Calculate the cost of individual bus trips per week**
Each bus trip costs $2.20. So, the total cost of individual bus trips per week is 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week.

3. **Compare the cost of individual bus trips with the weekly bus pass**
The weekly bus pass costs $20.00. This is less than the cost of individual bus trips per week, which is $22.00.

4. **Calculate the savings from buying a weekly bus pass**
To find the savings, subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the cost of individual bus trips per week: $22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week.

To find the number of days, we need to calculate the days from December 31st to July 19th. December has 31 days, so there is 1 day left in December. The months January, February, March, April, May, and June have 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively. From July, we only need 19 days. So the total number of days is 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days.


2. Calculate the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs.
Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 lbs is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.


3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to reach the goal.
To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days. So, the daily calorie deficit is 105,000 / 211 ≈ 498 calories.

We are given that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount to be divided is $100.


### 2. Represent Brad's share as a variable
Let's represent Brad's share as x.


### 3. Express Jeff's share in terms of Brad's share
Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.


### 4. Set up the equation based on the total amount
The sum of Jeff's and Brad's shares is equal to the total amount, which is $100. So, the equation is x + 4x = 100.


### 5. Combine like terms in the equation
Combine the x terms: 5x = 100.


### 6. Solve for x (Brad's share)
Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x: x = 100 / 5 = 20.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week
* Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.
* To find the number of pages she can read per minute, divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes: 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages/minute.
* Total pages in the first week = 105 minutes * 1.33 pages/minute = 140 pages.


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks
* In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.
* Total pages in two weeks = Total pages in the first week + Total pages in the second week = 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.

* Let's denote the number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna as R, M, and A respectively.
* We are given that Richie scored 80 goals, so R = 80.

### 2
* We are also given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can express this as R = M + 20.
* Since we know R = 80, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 80 = M + 20.

### 3
* Solving for M, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to get M = 60.

### 4
* We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can express this as R = A + 45.
* Since we know R = 80, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 80 = A + 45.

To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonade that weekend than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mitchell made.

### 2
Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade.

### 3
Mitchell's total earnings = 21 lemonades * $4/lemonade = $84

### 4
Now, we need to find the difference between Mitchell's earnings and Liam's earnings.

### 5
Liam made $63 that weekend, so we can calculate the difference by subtracting Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

### 6
Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings = $84 - $63

### 7
Performing the subtraction will give us the amount of money Mitchell made more than Liam.

### 8
Difference = $21

### 9
So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

## 2. Calculate the Number of Small Pieces per Crayon
Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of small pieces per crayon, we'll assume each crayon can be divided into an average number of small pieces. However, this information isn't necessary for our calculation because we're given that 8 small pieces are melted together to make one muffin crayon.

The difference between the actual temperature (468) and the set temperature (450) is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.


2. Calculate the percentage by which the oven is off.
To calculate the percentage, divide the difference (18) by the set temperature (450) and multiply by 100: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.


3. Calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature for the recipe.
Since the oven is off by the same percentage (4%) for any recipe, calculate 4% of the recipe temperature (520): (520 * 4) / 100 = 20.8 degrees.

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.


**Step 2** Calculate the total calories burned from running
Hannah spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.


**Step 3** Calculate the total calories burned
Total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running. Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.


**Step 4** Calculate the total amount of water needed
Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many 200-calorie units she burned, we divide the total calories burned by 200. 1600 calories / 200 calories/unit = 8 units. Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, the total amount of water needed is 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.


### 2. Translate the given information into mathematical expressions
From the note on the jar, we have the following expressions:
- R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
- G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)


### 3. Express the total number of jelly beans using the variables
The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
R + B + G = 4500


### 4. Substitute the expressions for R and G from step 2 into the equation from step 3
Substituting R = 0.99B and G = 1.01B into the equation, we get:
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500


### 5. Combine like terms and solve for B
Combining like terms, we get:
3.00B = 4500
Dividing both sides by 3.00, we get:
B = 1500


### 6. Calculate the number of red and green jelly beans
Now that we have the value of B, we can calculate R and G:
R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515


### 7. Calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans
The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

We need to find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob. The key elements are:
* The initial distance between Bob and Tom: 75 miles
* Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
* Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour


### 2. Calculate the relative speed between Bob and Tom
To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. The relative speed is the difference between Tom's speed and Bob's speed:
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph


### 3. Use the formula distance = speed × time to find the time
We can use the formula distance = speed × time to find the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob. We know the distance (75 miles) and the relative speed (15 mph), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for time:
Time = distance / relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Now we can calculate the time:

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.


## Step 2. Calculate the cost of the leather seats
The leather seats cost one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. 
One-third of $7,500 is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.


## Step 3. Calculate the cost of the running boards
The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats. 
$2,500 - $500 = $2,000.


## Step 4. Calculate the total cost of the added features
The total cost of the added features is the sum of the costs of the king cab upgrade, leather seats, running boards, towing package, and the upgraded exterior light package. 
However, the cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will denote it as x for now.
The total cost of the added features is $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + x + $1,500 = $13,500 + x.


## Step 5. Calculate the total cost of the truck
The total cost of the truck is the sum of the base price and the total cost of the added features.
However, the cost of the towing package is not provided, so we will denote it as x for now.
The total cost of the truck is $30,000 + $13,500 + x = $43,500 + x.


## Step 6. Determine the cost of the towing package
Since the problem does not provide the cost of the towing package, we will assume that the towing package is included in the ""several added features"" and its cost is not provided, so we cannot calculate the total cost of the truck without this information.


## Step 7. Re-evaluate the problem
However, we can still calculate the total cost of the truck without the towing package.
The total cost of the truck without the towing package is $43,500.


## Step 8. Provide the final answer
Since we cannot calculate the total cost of the truck with the towing package, we will provide the total cost of the truck without the towing package.

3. We also know that each animal has one head, so the total number of heads is S + G = 20.

There is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so the total number of children is 2 (twins) + 3 (triplets) = 5.


### 4
The combined ages of the children are 44, so we can express this as 2T + 3t = 44.


### 5
We can substitute the expression for T from step 2 into the equation from step 4: 2(t + 7) + 3t = 44.


### 6
Expanding the equation from step 5, we get 2t + 14 + 3t = 44.


### 7
Combining like terms in the equation from step 6, we get 5t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation from step 7, we get 5t = 30.

* The price of an orange is three times the price of a banana.
* The price of a banana is $1.
* Therefore, the price of an orange is 3 * $1 = $3.


**Step 3** Calculate the total price of the fruits in a crate
* A crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
* The price of a banana is $1, the price of an apple is $0.5, and the price of an orange is $3.
* The total price of the bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
* The total price of the apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
* The total price of the oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.


**Step 4** Calculate the total price of a crate
* The total price of a crate is the sum of the prices of all the fruits.
* The total price of the bananas is $5.
* The total price of the apples is $6.
* The total price of the oranges is $21.

726,"### 1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches
First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches by multiplying 8 by 12, then add the 4 inches.


### 2. Perform the conversion calculation
8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches: 96 + 4 = 100 inches


### 3. Set up the equation for the length of Topher's shoe
Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as B. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. So, the equation is:
9B + 10 = 100


### 4. Solve the equation for B
Now, we need to isolate B. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
9B = 100 - 10
9B = 90


### 5. Continue solving for B
Next, divide both sides of the equation by 9 to find B:
B = 90 / 9
B = 10


### 6. Verify the solution
We can plug B back into the original equation to verify that it's true:
9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100


### 7. Conclusion
Since the equation holds true, we can conclude that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed 10 inches.

Now, we know that the activity requires 12 groups, and each group should have 9 students.


### 4
To find the total number of students required for 12 groups, we multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group.
12 groups * 9 students per group = 108 students


### 5
However, we are not concerned with the total number of students, but rather the number of groups.


### 6
Since we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups.


### 7
To do this, we subtract the number of groups we already have from the total number of groups required.
12 groups - 6 groups = 6 groups


### 8
Therefore, we need 6 more groups to form a total of 12 groups.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.


2. Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading small stickers.
Since each large button is worth three small stickers, Lorraine gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons from trading small stickers.


3. Determine the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.


4. Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers for large buttons.
Since each large sticker is worth one large button, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers for large buttons.


5. Determine the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for small buttons.
Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers, which is 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers, for small buttons.


6. Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers for small buttons.
Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, Lorraine gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers for small buttons.


7. Calculate the total number of large buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine gets 9 large buttons from trading small stickers and 20 large buttons from trading large stickers for large buttons. So, she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.


8. Calculate the total number of small buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine gets 60 small buttons from trading large stickers for small buttons and she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left, which is equivalent to 3 small buttons. So, she has 60 + 3 = 63 small buttons.


9. Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Since each large button is worth three small buttons, Lorraine has 29 * 3 = 87 small buttons equivalent from large buttons. Adding this to the 63 small buttons she has, Lorraine has a total of 87 + 63 = 150 small buttons equivalent.

2. We are given that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, so we can express this relationship as F = 2A.


3. We also know that the total number of council members is 33, and since each member votes either in favor or against, the total number of votes is F + A = 33.


4. Now we can substitute the expression for F from step 2 into the equation from step 3, giving us 2A + A = 33.


5. Combining like terms, we get 3A = 33.


6. Solving for A, we find A = 33 / 3 = 11.


7. Now that we know A, we can find F using the relationship F = 2A from step 2.

* So, the number of students who need size small shirts is 2 * 11 = 22.


**Step 3** Calculate the number of students who need size medium shirts.
* Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
* So, the number of students who need size medium shirts is 22 - 4 = 18.


**Step 4** Calculate the number of students who need size large shirts.
* Half as many students need size large as size medium.
* So, the number of students who need size large shirts is 18 / 2 = 9.


**Step 5** Calculate the number of students who need size extra-large shirts.
* Six more students need size extra-large than large.
* So, the number of students who need size extra-large shirts is 9 + 6 = 15.

To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed.


### 2
Since each group consists of 9 people and there are 90 people in total, we can calculate the number of groups by dividing the total number of people by the number of people in each group.


### 3
Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people in each group
= 90 / 9
= 10


### 4
Next, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back seashells. We are given that 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells.


### 5
Number of groups with seashells = (3/5) * Number of groups
= (3/5) * 10
= 6


### 6
Now, we know that each member in these groups brought back 2 seashells.


### 7
Total number of seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of people in each group * Number of seashells per person
= 6 * 9 * 2

### 8
However, the question asks for the number of seashells brought back by the members of the groups, not the total number of seashells including the leaders. Since the leaders are also part of the group, we need to subtract the number of leaders (which is equal to the number of groups) from the total number of people who brought back seashells.


### 9
Number of people who brought back seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of people in each group
= 6 * 9

### 10
Since each person brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells is:
Total number of seashells = Number of people who brought back seashells * Number of seashells per person

1. **Identify the Speed Difference**
The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, and the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The speed difference between the two cars is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour.


2. **Determine the Time Frame**
We are interested in finding the distance between the two cars after 2 hours.


3. **Calculate the Distance Gained by the Second Car**
Since the second car is traveling 10 miles per hour faster than the first car, it will gain 10 miles per hour * 2 hours = 20 miles on the first car.


4. **Conclusion**
After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The problem states that the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. We are given that there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, and we need to find out how many additional students would have joined by the end of May.


**Step 2** Calculate the Number of Students at the End of Each Month
Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- January: 10 * 2 = 20
- February: 20 * 2 = 40
- March: 40 * 2 = 80
- April: 80 * 2 = 160
- May: 160 * 2 = 320


**Step 3** Calculate the Additional Students Joined by the End of May
To find the additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320).


**Step 4** Perform the Calculation
Additional students joined = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
= 320 - 10

They play for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.


**Step 2** Calculate the time each friend plays.

Two of his friends play half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
One of his friends plays 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.


**Step 3** Calculate the number of quarters each person uses.
Jack plays for 240 minutes, so he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
Two of his friends play for 240 minutes, so they use 240 / 10 = 24 quarters each.
One of his friends plays for 240 minutes, so he uses 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.


**Step 4** Calculate the total number of quarters used.
Jack uses 12 quarters.
Two of his friends use 24 quarters each, so they use 2 * 24 = 48 quarters.
One of his friends uses 8 quarters.
The total number of quarters used is 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

3. Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the amount of sugar will also be 2x ounces.


4. Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.
So, the amount of oil will be 2 * 2x = 4x ounces.

To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to first determine how high Saskay, Kagiyami, and then Naruto can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei's ability.

### 2
Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

### 3
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches high.

### 4
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.

### 5
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

### 6
To convert inches to feet, we divide the total inches by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot.

* We are given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway.
* We need to find out how many hours it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance.
* The turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos.


#### Step 2. Calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo to travel the distance
* Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, we can calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.
* Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 = 6 hours.


#### Step 3. Calculate the time it would take for one turtle to travel the distance
* Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance.
* Time for one turtle = 2 * Time for one kangaroo = 2 * 6 hours = 12 hours.


#### Step 4. Calculate the time it would take for four turtles to travel the distance
* Since all turtles are traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance is the same as the time it takes for one turtle.
* Time for four turtles = Time for one turtle = 12 hours.

To find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student will get. total_glue_sticks_needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.


## Step 2. Determine the number of glue sticks in each pack
We know that the glue sticks come in packs of 8.


## Step 3. Calculate the minimum number of packs needed
To find the minimum number of packs needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in each pack. packs_needed = total_glue_sticks_needed / glue_sticks_per_pack = 54 / 8 = 6.75.


## Step 4. Consider that packs can only be bought whole

## Step 1. Define the variables and the problem
Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as x minutes. We are given that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore.


## Step 2. Formulate the equation for the final concert
The runtime of the final concert is twice the runtime of her usual concerts plus the 15-minute encore. Therefore, the equation for the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65.


## Step 3. Solve the equation for x
To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to solve the equation 2x + 15 = 65 for x.


## Step 4. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation
Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation gives us 2x = 65 - 15, which simplifies to 2x = 50.


## Step 5. Divide both sides of the equation by 2
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us x = 50 / 2, which simplifies to x = 25.


## Step 6. Verify the solution
We can verify our solution by plugging x = 25 back into the original equation: 2(25) + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65, which is correct.

* We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.
* We also know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.


### 2
* Since a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can use this information to find the speed of a thingamabob.
* We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so we can set up the equation: whatchamacallit speed = 11 * thingamabob speed.
* Substituting the known value, we get 121 = 11 * thingamabob speed.


### 3
* To find the speed of a thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11.
* This gives us thingamabob speed = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.


### 4
* Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a whirligig.
* We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Martha decided she needed more notebooks and then bought 5 more for a total of 7 notebooks. How many more than Joseph does she now have?


## Step 1. Determine Martha's Initial Number of Notebooks
Martha bought 5 more notebooks for a total of 7. To find Martha's initial number of notebooks, we subtract 5 from 7.


## Step 2. Calculate Martha's Initial Number of Notebooks
Martha's initial number of notebooks = 7 - 5 = 2


## Step 3. Determine Joseph's Initial Number of Notebooks
Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Since Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.


## Step 4. Calculate the Difference Between Martha's and Joseph's Notebooks After Martha's Purchase
Martha now has 7 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's number of notebooks.


## Step 5. Calculate the Difference
Difference = Martha's notebooks - Joseph's notebooks = 7 - 6 = 1

945,"## Step 1. Calculate the distance James swims at his initial pace
James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance at his initial pace of 2 miles per hour. To find the distance he swims at this pace, we calculate 60% of 20 miles: 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

## Step 2. Calculate the time James takes to swim the initial distance
Since James swims 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour, we can find the time taken by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

## Step 3. Calculate the time James rests on the island
James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours. Therefore, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

## Step 4. Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim
Since James has already swum 12 miles, the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

## Step 5. Calculate the speed at which James swims the remaining distance
James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

## Step 6. Calculate the time James takes to swim the remaining distance
Since James swims 8 miles at a pace of 1 mile per hour, we can find the time taken by dividing the distance by the speed: 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

## Step 7. Calculate the total time James takes to get across the lake
The total time is the sum of the time taken to swim the initial distance, the resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

Let's denote Bahati's score as B, Azibo's score as A, and Dinar's score as D.


#### Step 2. Translate the given information into equations
We know that B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. We also know that the total score is 45, so B + A + D = 45.


#### Step 3. Express A and D in terms of B
From the first equation, A = B - 20. From the second equation, D = B - 10.


#### Step 4. Substitute A and D in terms of B into the total score equation
Substituting A and D into the total score equation, we get B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45.


#### Step 5. Solve for B
Combine like terms to get 3B - 30 = 45. Add 30 to both sides to get 3B = 75. Divide by 3 to get B = 25.


#### Step 6. Find Azibo's score
Now that we know Bahati's score, we can find Azibo's score using the equation A = B - 20. A = 25 - 20 = 5.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. To find the initial number of occupied beds, we multiply the total capacity by 1/5.
Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds


**Step 2** Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds
The initial number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the initial number of occupied beds.
Initial unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks
The hospital admits 50 patients each day. To find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks, we multiply the daily admissions by the number of days in 2 weeks (14 days).
Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients


**Step 4** Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks
The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied beds and the total patients admitted in 2 weeks.

 Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number, but Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%.


2. Determine the number of people Courtney overstated
 To find the number of people Courtney overstated, we need to calculate 20% of the number she reported, which is 48.


3. Calculate 20% of 48
 20% of 48 is equal to 0.20 * 48 = 9.6.


4. Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number
 We round down 9.6 to 10, but since we are looking for the actual number of people who attended the concert, we will use 9.6 as the number of people Courtney overstated.


5. Calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert
 To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we subtract the number of people Courtney overstated from the number she reported.


6. Perform the subtraction
 Actual number of people = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4


7. Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number
 We round down 38.4 to 38.


8. Verify the result
 We can verify our result by checking if 20% of 38 is indeed less than 48.


9. Perform the verification
 20% of 38 is equal to 0.20 * 38 = 7.6, which is less than 48.

* We also know that A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan).
* Additionally, S = 4D - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe).

**Step 3** Substitute the equations to solve for S
* We can substitute A from the second equation into the first equation: (S + 5) + S + D = 339.
* Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + D + 5 = 339.
* We can also substitute S from the third equation into the simplified equation: 2(4D - 13) + D + 5 = 339.

**Step 4** Solve for D
* Expanding the equation, we get 8D - 26 + D + 5 = 339.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, we have two sides of 15 feet and two sides of 10 feet.


2. Apply the perimeter formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).
Using the given dimensions, we can plug in the values: Perimeter = 2(15 + 10) = 2(25) = 50 feet.


3. Determine the total number of feet of fencing needed.
Since the perimeter of the garden is 50 feet, Robert will need 50 feet of fencing.


4. Calculate the total number of wooden slats required.
Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. To find the total number of slats, we multiply the total feet of fencing by 2: 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.


5. State the final result.
Based on the calculations, Robert will need a total of 100 wooden slats.

* Let's denote Emil's dad's current age as D.
* Let's denote Emil's brother's current age as B.

**Step 2** Calculate Emil's age when he turns 24
* Emil will turn 24 in 5 years (24 - 19 = 5 years).
* At that time, Emil's age will be 24 years old.

**Step 3** Calculate Emil's dad's age when Emil turns 24
* When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches


### 2. Calculate the total space required for each plant
Each plant grows 12 inches wide and needs 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) of space between it and the next plant. So, the total space required for each plant is:
12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between plants) = 30 inches


### 3. Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed
Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the total space required for each plant:
1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants
Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

999,"### 1. Determine the total number of slices
* Let's assume the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids).
* However, we need to consider the size of the slices, not just the number.

### 2. Assign a variable to the size of a kid's slice
* Let's say the size of a kid's slice is x.
* Then, the size of an adult's slice is 2x, since it's twice as big as a kid's slice.

### 3. Calculate the total size of all slices
* The total size of all slices is the sum of the sizes of the adult slices and the kid slices.
* Total size = 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

### 4. Calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets
* The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is the size of their slice divided by the total size, multiplied by 100.
* Percentage per adult = (2x / 8x) * 100 = (1/4) * 100 = 25.

### 5. Verify the calculation
* We can verify the calculation by checking that the total percentage adds up to 100.
* 2 adults * 25% = 50% for adults, and 4 kids * (100% - 50%) / 4 = 12.5% each for kids, which adds up to 100%.

* Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars.
* Peter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars.
* Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.
* We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.


### 2. Calculate the total number of boxes sold
* Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
* To find the total number of boxes sold, we add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
* Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.


### 3. Set up an equation to represent the situation
* Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box.
* Since they sold 8 boxes in total, the total number of chocolate bars sold is 8x.
* We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 64.


### 4. Solve the equation to find the number of chocolate bars in a box
* To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8.

## Step 1. Calculate the Total Number of Sweets in the Box
The box contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. To find the total number of sweets, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack.
Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces


## Step 2. Determine the Number of Packs Anne Gave Away
Anne kept 2 packs and gave the rest to her friends. To find the number of packs she gave away, we subtract the number of packs she kept from the total number of packs.
Packs given away = 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs


## Step 3. Calculate the Total Number of Sweets Given Away
Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack.
Total sweets given away = 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces


## Step 4. Calculate the Number of Sweets Each Friend Received
Anne gave the sweets to her 10 friends equally. To find the number of sweets each friend received, we divide the total number of sweets given away by the number of friends.

Let's denote the share of the first person as x.

### 2. Express the share of the second person in terms of the first person's share
The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is x + 80.

### 3. Express the share of the third person in terms of the second person's share
The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

### 4. Write the equation representing the total amount shared
The sum of the shares of the three people is equal to the total amount of $1920, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

### 5. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.
Combine x terms: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, the painters worked 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day, we need to convert this fraction to hours.
There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours per day.


3. Now, let's calculate the total hours worked by all painters.
The painters worked 21 days, 9 hours per day, so the total hours worked is 21 * 9 = 189 hours.

2. According to the problem, Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, so we can express this as x = y + 4.


3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so we can express this as z = y / 2.


4. We also know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can express this as x + y + z = 19.


5. Now, we can substitute the expressions for x and z from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 4: (y + 4) + y + (y / 2) = 19.


6. To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2(y + 4) + 2y + y = 38.


7. Expanding the equation, we get 2y + 8 + 2y + y = 38.


8. Combining like terms, we get 5y + 8 = 38.


9. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 5y = 30.


10. Dividing both sides by 5, we get y = 6.


Now that we know y, we can find x using the equation from step 2: x = y + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

## Step 1. Determine the Number of Jellyfish Created per Second by One Spring
* One spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.


## Step 2. Calculate the Number of Jellyfish Created per Second by 5 Springs
* Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per second is 5 * 1 = 5 jellyfish per second.


## Step 3. Calculate the Number of Seconds in 4 Hours
* There are 60 seconds in 1 minute.
* There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.
* Therefore, the total number of seconds in 1 hour is 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.
* The total number of seconds in 4 hours is 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.


## Step 4. Calculate the Total Number of Jellyfish Created by 5 Springs in 4 Hours
* Multiply the number of jellyfish created per second by 5 springs (5 jellyfish/second) by the total number of seconds in 4 hours (14400 seconds).
* Total jellyfish created = 5 jellyfish/second * 14400 seconds = 72000 jellyfish.

We are given that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice as high as Binkie's score. We also know that Binkie's score is 90.

To find Frankie's score, we first need to calculate twice Binkie's score. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.


**Step 3** Add 15 to twice Binkie's score
Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. So, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score. Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

* But since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we will assume that the bride, the groom, and the people who were part of the ceremony were already inside the church before the ceremony started.
* Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is equal to the total number of people who attended the ceremony plus the bride, the groom, and the people who were part of the ceremony.
* However, since the problem does not provide information about the number of people who were part of the ceremony, we will assume that the number of people who were part of the ceremony is negligible.
* Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is approximately equal to the total number of people who attended the ceremony.

* Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is approximately equal to the total number of people who attended the ceremony.

### 5. Calculate the final answer
* Since the total number of people who attended the ceremony is equal to the total number of people outside the church, we can conclude that the total number of people inside the church is approximately equal to the total number of people outside the church.
* However, this is not possible because the people outside the church were the ones who came to attend the ceremony, and the people inside the church were the ones who were part of the ceremony.
* Therefore, we need to add the bride and the groom to the total number of people outside the church to get the total number of people inside the church.

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, which is 1/5. A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the proportion of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (1/5) = 1/15.


**Step 2** Determine the total number of jellyfish that change color under UV light.
We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.


**Step 3** Set up an equation to find the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
Let x be the total number of jellyfish in the tank. Since 1/15 of the jellyfish change color, we can set up the equation: (1/15)x = 6.


**Step 4** Solve the equation to find the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15: x = 6 * 15.


**Step 5** Calculate the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
x = 6 * 15 = 90.

=============================================

### Problem Description

Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.


### Solution Steps


1. Determine Sofie's Total Distance in 7 Days
--------------------------------------------

Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can calculate her total distance in 7 days by multiplying her daily distance by 7.

Sofie's total distance = 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles


2. Determine Brian's Total Distance in 7 Days
---------------------------------------------

We are given that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in 7 days. Therefore, we can calculate Brian's total distance by dividing Sofie's total distance by 2.

Brian's total distance = Sofie's total distance / 2 = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

The first 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour.
The other 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour.
So, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one hour is 12 + 8 = 20 toys.


**Step 2** Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours.
Since the first 4 workers produce 20 toys an hour, in 10 hours they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of toys still needed after the first 4 workers finish their shift.
The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total and still needs 20 toys after the first 4 workers finish their shift.
So, before the first 4 workers finish their shift, the total number of toys needed is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.


**Step 4** Calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours.
Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys after the first 4 workers finish their shift, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in 10 hours is 380 toys.


**Step 5** Calculate the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours.
Since the first 4 workers produce 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker produces 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.


**Step 6** Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour.
Since the fifth worker produces 180 toys in 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as x. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted x + 12 eggs. We know that the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30.


**Step 3** Solve the equation to find the number of eggs painted by Sarah.
Combine like terms: 2x + 12 = 30.
Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x = 18.
Divide both sides by 2: x = 9.

To find the number of boxes needed, divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box.
Number of boxes = Total crayons / Crayons per box = 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.


3. Calculate the total weight of crayons
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of crayons is:
Total weight of crayons = Total crayons * Weight per crayon = 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.


4. Calculate the total weight of boxes
Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of boxes is:

Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes = 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.


6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds
Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to get the weight in pounds.
Total weight in pounds = Total weight in ounces / 16 = 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

* Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
* The distance covered on the beach is 2 miles.

### 2. Calculate the speed of Grandma on the beach
* Speed is calculated as distance divided by time.
* Since the time is given in minutes, we need to convert it to hours to get the speed in miles per hour (mph).
* Time spent on the beach in hours = 40 minutes / 60 = 2/3 hours.
* Speed on the beach = 2 miles / (2/3 hours) = 3 mph.

### 3. Calculate the speed of Grandma on the sidewalk
* Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
* Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph.

### 4. Determine the time spent walking on the sidewalk
* The distance covered on the sidewalk is 1 mile.
* Time spent on the sidewalk = distance / speed = 1 mile / 6 mph.
* Since the speed is in miles per hour, we need to convert the time to minutes.
* Time spent on the sidewalk in hours = 1/6 hours.
* Time spent on the sidewalk in minutes = (1/6 hours) * 60 = 10 minutes.

### 5. Calculate the total time spent on the walk
* Total time spent = time spent on the beach + time spent on the sidewalk.

Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. To find the total amount she has saved, we multiply the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32


**Step 2** Determine the remaining amount Jane needs to save.
Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:
$60 - $32 = $28


**Step 3** Calculate the number of weeks it will take Jane to save the remaining amount.
Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can divide the remaining amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each week to find the number of weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

49 small-sized scenes / 7 small-sized scenes per day = 7 days


### 4. Determine the total number of days required to complete the project

Since Lauren can only work on one size of picture scene per day, we need to find the maximum number of days required among the three sizes.
Maximum days required = max(9 days, 6 days, 7 days) = 9 days


### 5. Consider if Lauren can work on multiple sizes of picture scenes in a single day

However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that Lauren can only work on one size of picture scene per day. But based on the given information, we can assume that she can only work on one size per day.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.


## Step 2. Express the relationship between the blue and yellow ropes
We know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write an equation: B = Y - 7.


## Step 3. Express the relationship between the red and blue ropes
We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation: R = 4B.


## Step 4. Write an equation for the combined length of the ropes
The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.


## Step 5. Substitute the expressions for R and B into the combined length equation
Substituting R = 4B and B = Y - 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get: 4B + B + Y = 37, and then 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37.


## Step 6. Simplify the equation
Expanding the equation, we get: 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, which simplifies to 6Y - 35 = 37.


## Step 7. Solve for Y
Adding 35 to both sides of the equation, we get: 6Y = 72, and then dividing both sides by 6, we get: Y = 12.


## Step 8. Find the length of the blue rope
Now that we know Y = 12, we can find B using the equation B = Y - 7, so B = 12 - 7 = 5.


## Step 9. Find the length of the red rope
Finally, we can find R using the equation R = 4B, so R = 4 * 5 = 20.

* The teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk on Monday.
* To find the amount of chalk used, multiply the total length of the chalk by the percentage used: 5 inches * 0.45 = 2.25 inches.

**Step 2** Calculate the amount of chalk left after Monday
* The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 2.25 inches on Monday.
* To find the amount of chalk left, subtract the amount used from the total length: 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

**Step 3** Calculate the amount of chalk the teacher will use each day
* The teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day.
* To find the amount of chalk used per day, multiply the total length of the chalk by the percentage used: 5 inches * 0.20 = 1 inch.

**Step 4** Calculate the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk
* The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left and will use 1 inch per day (20% of the original 5 inches).
* However, since the teacher will be using 20% of the original 5 inches, we should calculate the number of days based on the remaining percentage of the original chalk.
* The teacher has 2.75 inches / 5 inches = 0.55 or 55% of the original chalk left.
* Since the teacher uses 20% of the original chalk per day, we can divide the remaining percentage by the daily usage percentage: 55% / 20% = 2.75.
* Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk and recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we should round down to the nearest whole number, as the teacher will not be able to use the chalk for a full day when it is smaller than 2 inches.
* However, in this case, we should round down to 2 days, because on the third day the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches.


**Step 5** Add the day the teacher already used the chalk
* The teacher already used the chalk for 1 day (Monday).
* To find the total number of days, add the day already used to the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk: 2 days + 1 day = 3 days, but since on the third day the chalk will be smaller than 2 inches, the teacher will not be able to use it for the full day.

* Since Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, we need to calculate how many he can build in 15 minutes.
* There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.
* In 0.25 hours, Jay can build 20 * 0.25 = 5 snowballs.

### 2. Calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can build in 15 minutes
* We know that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
* So, the net number of snowballs Jay can build in 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

### 3. Calculate the total number of 15-minute intervals needed to build 60 snowballs
* Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many 15-minute intervals it will take to build that many.
* In each 15-minute interval, Jay builds a net of 3 snowballs.
* To find the number of intervals, we divide the total number of snowballs needed (60) by the net number of snowballs built per interval (3).
* 60 / 3 = 20 intervals.

### 4. Calculate the total time needed to build 60 snowballs
* Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the length of each interval.
* 20 intervals * 15 minutes/interval = 300 minutes.

1188,"**Step 1** Understand the Problem
We are given that Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and when it came out, John was twice as old as Jim. We also know that John is currently 28 years old.


**Step 2** Calculate John's Age 20 Years Ago
To find out how old John was 20 years ago, we subtract 20 from his current age.
John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8


**Step 3** Calculate Jim's Age 20 Years Ago
Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can calculate Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2.
Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2 = 4


**Step 4** Calculate Jim's Current Age
To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago.
Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

The nurses used 38 bandages on the first day.


**Step 2** Calculate the total number of bandages used on the second day.
The nurses used 10 fewer bandages on the second day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of bandages used on the third day.
The nurses used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

We are given an equation that represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. The equation is: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40"". We need to find the number of coffee mugs.


### 2. Translate the problem into an equation
Let's represent the number of coffee mugs as ""x"". The equation can be written as: 4x + 8 = 40.


### 3. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation
To isolate the term with the variable, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8, which simplifies to 4x = 32.


### 4. Divide both sides of the equation by 4
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 32 / 4.


### 5. Simplify the equation
x = 8.

1. Determine Mattison's height in inches.
Mattison is 60 inches tall.


2. Calculate the total height of the two-story house.
The house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.


3. Calculate the height of the first floor.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.


4. Calculate the height of the second floor and the roof combined.
Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor and the roof combined is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.


5. Calculate the height of the second floor.
Assuming the height of the second floor is the same as the first floor (thrice as high as Mattison), the height of the second floor is also 180 inches.


6. Calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.
However, we cannot assume the height of the second floor is the same as the first floor. We only know the combined height of the second floor and the roof. Since we do not have the exact height of the second floor, we can only calculate the height of the roof if we know the height of the second floor is the same as the first floor or if we have more information about the second floor's height.

* Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B.
* Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so B = 3C - 2.

**Step 2** Determine the total number of treats needed for the class.
* There are 5 people in the class, and each person gets 2 treats.
* The total number of treats needed is 5 * 2 = 10.

**Step 3** Express the total number of treats in terms of cupcakes and brownies.
* The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so C + B = 10.

**Step 4** Substitute the expression for B from Step 1 into the equation from Step 3.
* Substitute B = 3C - 2 into C + B = 10, resulting in C + 3C - 2 = 10.

**Step 5** Solve the equation for C.
* Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

There are 20 plants in total. 4 plants need half of a cup of water and 8 plants need 1 cup of water. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.


**Step 2** Calculate the total amount of water needed for the plants that need half of a cup of water.
4 plants need half of a cup of water. So, the total amount of water needed for these plants is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.


**Step 3** Calculate the total amount of water needed for the plants that need 1 cup of water.
8 plants need 1 cup of water. So, the total amount of water needed for these plants is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.


**Step 4** Calculate the total amount of water needed for the plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water. So, the total amount of water needed for these plants is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.


**Step 5** Calculate the total amount of water needed for all the plants.
The total amount of water needed for all the plants is the sum of the water needed for each type of plant. So, the total amount of water needed is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

* The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
* To find the cost price of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons: $80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 per watermelon.


### 2. Calculate the selling price of each watermelon with a 25% profit
* The vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit.
* To find the selling price, we calculate 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price: 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 × $1.60 = $0.40.
* Add the profit to the cost price: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

1314,"1. Determine James' current age
  * Since James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate Dora's current age by subtracting 3 from 12.
  * Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
  * Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

2. Determine John's current age
  * John had James when he was 19 years old.
  * Since James is currently 18 years old, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

3. Determine the youngest son's current age
  * John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
  * Since John is currently 37 years old, the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

4. Calculate the youngest son's age in 3 years
  * To find the youngest son's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.
  * The youngest son's age in 3 years will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

* First, let's calculate the cost of the new radiator at the junk shop.
* The original price of the radiator is $400.
* Mark gets it for 80% off, so we need to calculate 80% of $400.

### 2
* To calculate 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8.
* 80% of $400 is $400 * 0.8 = $320.
* Since Mark gets it for 80% off, we subtract $320 from the original price.
* The cost of the radiator at the junk shop is $400 - $320 = $80.

### 3
* Next, let's calculate the cost of hiring a mechanic to install the radiator.
* The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.
* We multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours to get the total cost.

1317,"**Solving the Problem: Number of Chickens on Farmer Brown's Farm**
====================================================================


1. **Understanding the Problem**
We are given that Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, which are either chickens or cows. The total number of legs of all the animals is 70.


2. **Identifying the Number of Legs for Each Animal**
Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.


3. **Representing the Number of Chickens and Cows Algebraically**
Let's represent the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that C + W = 20 (the total number of animals).


4. **Representing the Total Number of Legs Algebraically**
The total number of legs can be represented as 2C + 4W = 70.


5. **Solving the System of Equations**
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.


6. **Rearranging the First Equation**
Rearrange the first equation to isolate W: W = 20 - C.


7. **Substituting W into the Second Equation**
Substitute W into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.


8. **Simplifying the Equation**
Simplify the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.


9. **Solving for C**
Combine like terms and solve for C: -2C = -10, C = 5.
