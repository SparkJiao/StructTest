• The paper discusses the detection of normal galaxies in deep x-ray surveys, particularly focusing on the cdf-n survey, which has reached a depth necessary to detect individual normal galaxies to 0.52 keV fluxes. The study aims to constrain the evolution of the ratio of x-ray luminosity to x-ray band luminosity of normal "" spiral galaxies up to 0.59, which is an indicator of current star formation rates. The paper also explores the fraction of the diffuse x-ray background explained by galaxies lingering below the cdf-n detection threshold, thus contributing to the x-ray luminosity of normal galaxies. The study also examines the properties of the sources that were excluded from the stacking samples due to x-ray detections, such as the x-ray candidates and the x-ray candidates from narrow-line galaxies. The paper concludes by comparing the average x-ray luminosity of the cdf-n sample with the average x-ray luminosity of the shapley et al. sample, which is consistent with the predictions of Ghosh & White (2001). The study also highlights the importance of considering the x-ray properties of the detected galaxies in the analysis of typical spiral galaxies.</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27, 'symbol': '•'}"

7,"• The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively.
• Folklore suggests that Feynman mentioned this notion in casual conversations circa 1985, but to this author's knowledge, there did not exist concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates until the mid-1990s.
• Encoding information in spin may have certain advantages, such as lower power dissipation in switching logic gates, and the possibility of lower energy dissipation in spintronic logic gates.
• First, there is the possibility of lower power dissipation in switching logic gates. In charge-based devices, such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors, switching between logic 0 and logic 1 is accomplished by moving charges into and out of the transistor channel.
• Motion of charges is induced by creating a potential gradient (or electric field). The associated potential energy is ultimately dissipated as heat and irretrievably lost.
• In the case of spin, we do not have to move charges. In order to switch a bit from 0 to 1, or vice versa, we merely have to toggle the spin. This may require much less energy.
• Second, spin does not couple easily to stray electric fields (unless there is strong spin-orbit interaction in the host material). Therefore, spin is likely to be relatively immune to noise.
• Finally, it is possible that spin devices may be faster. If we do not have to move electrons around, we will not be limited by the transit time of charges.
• In 1994, the author proposed a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (nand) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field. By ""three spins,"" the author means the spin orientations of three conduction band electrons, each confined in a semiconductor quantum dot.
• The system is shown schematically in fig. 
• Exchange interaction is allowed only between nearest neighbor spins (second nearest neighbor interaction is considered too weak to have any effect).
• Because of the magnetic field, the spin orientation in any quantum dot becomes a binary variable; it is either parallel or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field.
• In the presence of exchange interaction between two electrons confined to two separate potentials (such as two different quantum dots), the anti-ferromagnetic ordering, or the singlet state, is preferred over the ferromagnetic ordering, or triplet state (two neighboring spins are anti-parallel).

8,"• The paper investigates the evolution of short-period binaries (CVs) under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum (AM). It finds that the observed period gap in CVs is a result of the lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range, which is sharp cut-off near 77 minutes. The paper proposes a model to explain this period gap, suggesting that the observed shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off is due to the accumulation of systems within this range. The model also predicts that the period minimum of CVs can be increased by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of caml efficiencies in the CV population. The paper also discusses the potential mechanisms that could increase the bounce period of CVs from the canonical theoretical value to the observed value, and proposes ways to wash out the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the minimum period. The paper concludes that the period minimum problem and period spike problem remain an open issue, and suggests that the period spike can be washed out sufficiently to rule out the period minimum problem on the basis of an objective statistical test against the observed CV period distribution.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '•'}"

1. The text discusses the possibility of injecting isotopic heterogeneity into the solar nebula, which could lead to a spatially heterogeneous chronometer for studying early phases of planet formation.
2. The authors present several new sets of mgu disk models that examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula, by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection process, for various disk and central protostar masses, including protostars with dwarf mass masses.
3. The models were computed with the same three-dimensional, gravitational hydrodynamics code that has been employed in previous mgu disk models.
4. The code performs second-order accurate hydrodynamics on a spherical coordinate grid, including radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation.
5. The models are designed to simulate the effects of varying minimum values of the stability parameter.
6. The authors present results for a variety of protostellar and protoplanetary disk masses, varied initial minimum stability parameters, and varied injection radii, for disks of two different sizes.
7. The dispersion of the color field about its mean radial value is used as a measure of isotopically distinct gas or small particles resulting from uv photochemistry.
8. The dispersion is a massless passive tracer that has no effect on disk dynamics, so the total amount of color added is irrelevant for the subsequent evolution of the disk.
9. The models seek to follow the deviations from uniformity of the color field, not the absolute amounts of color added; the evolution of the dispersion of the color field about its mean radial value is the goal of these models.
10. The dispersion is a strong function of orbital radius and time, with the dispersion initially being relatively large (i.e., at 180 yr) as a result of isotopes traveling downward and radially inward and outward.
11. The dispersion decreases dramatically in the outer disks for both models by 777 yr to a value of 1% to 2%.
12. The dispersion in both models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 and 1.0 - 2.6 - 2 at two times is similar, showing that the exact location of the injection location has little effect on the long-term evolution of the distribution.

The nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon is currently being studied both theoretically and experimentally. The similarity between the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the van der Waals forces suggests the existence of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. Similar experiments of eos and indra followed shortly. Using different reactions, the plateau-like region was identified, which was absent in most cases. Factors contributing to these discrepancies include the precision of experimental measurements and the finite size effects of the caloric curve. The smm calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of 600 meV/nucleon bombarding energy. The microcanonical multifragmentation model from ref. *xcite is improved by refining the primary break-up part and including the secondary particle emission. The caloric curve is reduced with the new version of the model, preserving its general aspect and indicating the transition regions clearly.

21,"The standard model of elementary particles (SM) has been successful in describing the nature at the electroweak (EW) scale. Recently, the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle, which is consistent with the SM Higgs boson. This discovery strengthens the correctness of the SM. Several groups have reported anomalies in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (μg-2), which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions. The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than *xmath10, as listed in table [tab: g-2]. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, we expect new particles and interactions related with the muon sector once we regard it as a hint of new physics. Gauge interactions have played a central role in constructing fundamental models in particle physics history. Following this line, in this paper, we propose the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The measured muon g-2 and the estimated differences from recent SM predictions in several references have been calculated. The most efficient interaction which induces the symmetry violation by the majorana masses is shown in figure [fig: m]. Its rate is given by *xmath41.

22,"• The study of entanglement in quantum multipartite systems, particularly in two qubits embedded in two independent amplitude damping reservoirs, reveals that entanglement can be stably distributed among all subsystems, regardless of the markovian approximate result or decoherenceless double j-c model result. The identity about entanglement in all subsystems is always satisfied, independent of any detail of the reservoirs and their coupling to the qubit. This identity is shown to be independent of any detail of the reservoirs and their coupling to the qubit, affecting only the explicit time evolution behavior and the final distribution.

25,"• The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum (ATX) in either hadronic or nuclear collisions is traditionally framed in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered partons to the detected hadron.
• The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part makes use of fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
• The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
• The actual application of the shower parton distributions (SPD) developed here to heavy ion collisions will be considered elsewhere.
• The concept of shower partrons is not new, since attempts have been made to generate such partons in PQCD processes as far as is permitted by the validity of the procedure.
• The significance of the SPD is not to be found in problems involving only collisions of leptons and hadrons, but in the recombination of shower partons with other partons that are not in the jet but in the ambient environment.
• The SPD that is determined through the use of eqs. (1) and (2) depends on the specific form of the shower parton FFs, which in turn depends on the wave function of the meson produced.
• The SPD obtained from eqs. (1) and (2) is not independent of the shower partons in the first place at any reasonably approximate @xmath1 in heavy ion collisions where hard partons are produced in a range of transverse momentum.

28,"• The need for efficient use of wireless spectrum in cognitive radio networks has led to significant interest in the analysis of cognitive radio systems.
• One possible scheme for the operation of the cognitive radio network is to allow secondary users to transmit concurrently on the same frequency band with primary users as long as the resulting interference power at primary receivers is below the interference temperature limit.
• Note that interference to primary users is caused by the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions, which allows signals to be received by all users within the communication range.
• Note further that this broadcast nature also makes wireless communications vulnerable to eavesdropping.
• The problem of secure transmission in the presence of an eavesdropper was first studied from an information-theoretic perspective in [1] where Wyner considered a wiretap channel model.
• In [1], the secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum achievable rate from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver, which can be attained while keeping the eavesdropper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages.
• Later, Wyner's result was extended to the Gaussian channel in [2].
• Recently, motivated by the importance of security in wireless applications, information-theoretic security has been investigated in fading multi-antenna and multiuser channels.
• For instance, cooperative relaying under secrecy constraints was studied in [3].
• In [3], for amplify and forward relaying schemes, not having analytical solutions for the optimal beamforming design under both total and individual power constraints, an iterative algorithm is proposed to numerically obtain the optimal beamforming structure and maximize the secrecy rates.
• Although cognitive radio networks are also susceptible to eavesdropping, the combination of cognitive radio channels and information-theoretic security has received little attention.
• Very recently, Pei et al. studied secure communication over multiple input, single output (miso) cognitive radio channels.
• In this work, finding the secrecy capacity-achieving transmit covariance matrix under joint transmit and interference power constraints is formulated as a quasiconvex optimization problem.
• In this paper, we investigate the collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in the cognitive radio network.
• First, we characterize the secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (af) cognitive relay channel.
• Then, we formulate the beamforming optimization as a quasiconvex optimization problem that can be solved through convex semidefinite programming (sdp).

* The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a major puzzle in particle physics, consisting of several pieces. The first piece is that the vacuum energy density (vacuum energy density) can be the cosmological constant (vacuum energy density), and various sources of vacuum energy exist, such as zero point energy of each particle and potential energies accompanied by phase transitions like the breakdown of electroweak symmetry via Higgs mechanism and the chiral symmetry breaking due to quark condensations. The second piece is that the experimental value of the vacuum energy density is estimated as 10^-47 gev, where the Newton constant (Newton constant) is 10^-46. The third piece is that the energy-momentum tensor of perfect fluids is given by (t - pf) and (t - v), and the energy-momentum tensor of vacuum is of the form (t - v). The vacuum has a negative pressure with -10^-46, and the Einstein equation is given by (t - v) and (e - eq), where (t - v) and (e - eq) are the cosmological constant and the vacuum expectation value on the neutral component of the Higgs doublet, respectively. The vacuum energy density can receive large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale.

49,"* Spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkalies have benefited from high precision experimental techniques, allowing for the interpretation of experimental results. Two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy is presented as a tool for studying atomic properties in higher excited states, overcoming the limitations of direct absorption of the probing laser. The method involves two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapour before being directed to the interaction region. The absorption of the pump laser as a function of probe laser detuning is monitored, presenting sub-doppler peaks corresponding to atomic resonances with trademark sidebands. This technique overcomes the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser, low signal-to-noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at the desired wavelength. The summary concludes that the two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy method is a reliable and simple tool for studying atomic properties in excited states, offering a valuable alternative to direct absorption of the probing laser.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"

The trihydrogen dication, @xmath1, consisting of three protons and one electron, is among the simplest coulomb systems. Its stability has been studied intensely in the sixties and early seventies. In a series of articles, Conroy, Schwartz, and Schaad investigated the potential energy surfaces of the electronic ground state and the lowest excited states at linear and isosceles triangular configurations. They concluded that @xmath1 is not stable. Later, the issue was reconsidered from the theoretical side by Shoucri and Darling, who examined equilateral configurations with variational linear combinations of atomic orbitals and two particular configurations with a more compact variational approach. No bound state has been determined in these calculations. Johnson and Poshusta reported another single-point calculation in the context of Gaussian basis set optimization for some one-electron systems. The molecular ion @xmath1 is studied in an equilateral triangle of size @xmath9. The protons are assumed to be infinitely massive according to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation at zero order. The Schrödinger equation for the system is written as @xmath10\psi({\mathbf r } ) = e\psi({\mathbf r } ) , where @xmath11 is the electron momentum, @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the distances from each proton to the electron and @xmath9 is the interproton distance. Atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath14=@xmath15=@xmath16=1 ) , although energies are expressed in rydbergs ( ry ) . The authors excluded the possibility of stable @xmath1 in the electronic ground state. However, the explicit electronic energy data are reported only for one particular equilateral triangular configuration at the triangle size @xmath7. In conclusion, accurate ab initio results on the basis of which the non-existence of @xmath1 can be demonstrated are scarce and not convincing. This question is thus addressed once again in the present study.</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 32, 'symbol': '*'}"

* Hybrid inflation and reheating models share an important common thread, involving the coupling of two or more dynamical, interacting scalar fields (or higher spin fields).
* The hybrid models as well as the dynamics of reheating typically include processes such as spinodal decomposition and parametric amplification, which require one to go beyond the tree level by including quantum effects either in a perturbative expansion or by means of non-perturbative mean field techniques such as the Hartree approximation or a large-n expansion.

* The Dirac equation tells us that for spin one-half point-like particles, *xmath6* for spin angular momentum, and is unity for orbital angular momentum (verified experimentally by Foley and Kusch).
* The lowest-order correction gives the famous Schwinger result, *xmath7*, which was verified experimentally by Foley and Kusch.
* The electron anomaly is now measured to a relative precision of about four parts in a billion (ppb), better than the precision on the fine-structure constant and kinoshita has used the measured electron anomaly to give the best determination of *xmath16*.
* The muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), and the relative contributions of heavier particles to *xmath5* scales as *xmath17*, so the muon has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections of about 40,000 over the electron.
* The standard model value of *xmath20* has measurable contributions from three types of radiative processes: qed loops containing leptons, hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops, and weak loops involving the higgs contribution, which is negligible.
* A few examples of such potential contributions are lepton substructure, anomalous *xmath25* couplings, and supersymmetry.
* The measurements of *xmath20* have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model.
* The muon anomaly is sensitive to the presence of new physics at the 100 gev scale.
* The muon presents a unique opportunity to observe an edm in a second-generation particle, where the cp phase might be different from the first generation, or the scaling with mass might be quadratic rather than linear.

• The Kepler mission has revolutionized our understanding of planet occurrence rates around stars of all types, with over 4100 planetary candidates discovered in 3200 systems.
• One of Kepler's most significant discoveries is that small planets (e.g., * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) are nearly ubiquitous, with some of the most common planets having sizes between Earth-sized and Neptune-sized.
• The transition from rocky planets to non-rocky planets is sharp, occurring near a planet radius of 100 AU.
• The mean correction factor for planets detected with radial velocity and high-resolution imaging is only 10% of the mean correction factor for single-star planets.
• The authors explored the effects of undetected companions on the derived occurrence rates of planets in the Kepler sample.
• If stars are assumed to be single and no companion vetting with radial velocity and/or high-resolution imaging is performed, the planetary radii are underestimated, leading to an overestimation of the planet bulk density by 10%.
• The authors found that if the Kepler objects of interest are all assumed to be single, the fraction of earth-sized planets may be overestimated by 15-20% and the fraction of large planets may be underestimated by 30%.
• Companion vetting simulations presented here show that a full understanding and characterization of the planetary companions is dependent upon also understanding the presence of stellar companions, but is also dependent upon understanding the limits of those observations.
• For a final occurrence rate determination of earth-sized planets and, more importantly, an uncertainty on that occurrence rate, the stellar companion detections (or lack thereof) must be taken into account.
• The authors would like to thank Ji Wang, Tim Morton, and Gerard van Belle for useful discussions during the writing of this paper.

* The authors suggest that the low-mass dwarf galaxies (lmds) and the low-mass spiral galaxies (lmsps) are the most likely candidates for dlas, as they are expected to be brighter and have larger separation on the sky between the bright qso and the dla galaxy.

* These arguments are independent of the value of the coupling at the CFT fixed point (a fixed line in the case of CFT4 sym).
* To linear order in the deformation parameter, the anomalous dimension matrix is expressed as a function of the coupling.

* The anomalous dimension matrix is the same as for the marginal case presented at the end of section 2.
* The callan-symanzik equation is used to include the running of the coupling at leading order in the deformation parameter.
* The authors define the renormalized operators starting from the undeformed bare theory.
* The renormalization matrix has entries _ ab = _ ab _ a+ u 2 ^ 2 a_dab.

80,"<summary>Source: The paper discusses the detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star, which are among the most important sources of gravitational waves due to the huge energy released in the process. In particular, the coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) may radiate about 10x10^6 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4-1.6 kHz, and range covered by most of the ground-based laser interferometers like Virgo, LIGO, GEO, or TAMA. The detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo, respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations is estimated. Besides the emission produced by the coalescence of the nearest DNS, the superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of GW. The paper extends its investigation to the extra-galactic contribution. Using DNS merging rates estimated in the precedent study, the gravitational wave background spectrum produced by these coalescences is estimated. Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods were performed to determine the critical redshift beyond which the duty cycle condition required to have a continuous background is satisfied. The redshift at which the progenitors have evolved and the system is now constituted by two neutron stars is estimated. The redshift at which the coalescence occurs is estimated by the duration of the inspiral phase, which depends on the orbital parameters just after the second supernova and on the neutron star masses.

The localization length in disordered systems, where negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) systems suppresses Anderson localization, is studied extensively.

The localization length in mixed stacks of alternating LH and RH layers is also analyzed, showing a quadratic dependence on disorder for low-disordered m stacks. The results suggest that the localization length is modulated by the reflection amplitude between alternating layers and decreases with disorder. The study of the localization length in homogeneous and mixed stacks with non-symmetric band distributions reveals more pronounced irregularities in the transmission spectrum compared to homogeneous stacks.

102,"<summary>Analysis of Resonance States: Methods and Convergence Properties</summary>

1. **Understanding Resonance States**: Resonance states are characterized by isolated complex eigenvalues, which are considered quasi-bound states with energy and inverse lifetime. These states are embedded in the continuum and are stabilized by the variational spectrum.

2. **Methods for Resonance States**: Various methods have been proposed to calculate the energy and lifetime of resonance states, including complex scaling methods, complex absorption potential methods, and complex absorption potential methods with variational bases.

3. **Complex Scaling Methods**: These methods rely on complex scaling properties to approximate the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. They are based on the assumption that the eigenvalues scale with the basis set size, leading to a linear scaling of the resonance energy with the basis set size.

4. **Complex Absorption Potential Methods**: These methods use complex absorption potentials to stabilize the resonance states. They are based on the assumption that the eigenvalues scale with the basis set size, leading to a linear scaling of the resonance energy with the basis set size.

5. **Complex Absorption Potential Methods with Variational Bases**: These methods use variational bases to approximate the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. They are based on the assumption that the eigenvalues scale with the basis set size, leading to a linear scaling of the resonance energy with the basis set size.

6. **Resonance States in One Body**: The analysis of resonance states in one body systems is particularly challenging due to the complex scaling properties of the eigenvalues. The use of complex scaling methods and complex absorption potential methods with variational bases is essential for obtaining accurate results.

7. **Resonance States in Two Body Systems**: The analysis of resonance states in two body systems is more complex due to the interaction between the two particles. The use of complex scaling methods and complex absorption potential methods with variational bases is essential for obtaining accurate results.

8. **Convergence Properties**: The convergence properties of the eigenenergies with respect to the basis set size are well understood. However, the appearance of bundles in the spectrum is not completely understood. The numerical evidence supports the idea that the systems studied here are quite general. The use of complex scaling methods and complex absorption potential methods with variational bases is essential for obtaining accurate results.",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '*'}"
103,"<summary>Research on Symmetric Systems: A New Approach</summary>

Symmetric systems have been a subject of interest in quantum mechanics and nonlinear optics. The work by @xmath0-invariant hamiltonians, which are not necessarily hermitian, may still give rise to completely real spectra, making them suitable for the description of physical settings. The authors propose a generalization of the one-dimensional @xmath0-symmetric oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which may be used as fundamental building blocks for the construction of @xmath0-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. The authors also introduce four basic types of plaquettes, three of which in the form of four-site squares. The final one was in the form of the five-site cross, motivated by earlier works on cross-shaped vortex solitons in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation. The authors analyze the stability of stationary modes and the perturbed dynamics of unstable modes. The difference of such modes from the @xmath0-symmetric ones considered in the present work is the fact that modes with the unbroken symmetry form a continuous family of solutions, with energy depending on the solution amplitude. The authors also introduce a more general nonlinearity, which includes @xmath0-balanced cubic gain and loss terms, in addition to their linear counterparts. The issue of potential existence of isolated solutions versus branches of solutions in @xmath0-symmetric systems is already starting to be addressed in the relevant literature. The present work may pave the way to further considerations of two-dimensional @xmath0-symmetric lattice systems, and even three-dimensional ones. The first step that needs to be completed would consist of the examination of a @xmath0-symmetric cube composed of eight sites, and the nonlinear modes that it can support. This, in turn, may be a preamble towards constructing full three-dimensional @xmath0-symmetric lattices.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16, 'symbol': '*'}"

• It proves useful in making quantitative predictions to quantify entanglement.
• When one has complete information about a bipartite system, the state of the system is pure and there exists a well-established measure of entanglement, the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix, with a unity for the bell states and a conserved under local operations and classical communication.

• Various measures have been proposed to circumvent this problem, most of which evaluate a lower bound.

The absence of obvious discontinuities in the ms turnoff / subgiant region indicates a more or less continuous star formation activity with possible intensity variations over time, but no big time gaps between successive bursts. The presence of a conspicuous hb is not seen in the cmd, suggesting that the fraction of stars older than 10 gyr is small, indicating that star formation may have been delayed in Leo I compared to other dsph galaxies.

130,"<summary>Colloidal suspensions present the possibility to develop novel materials via self-assembly. Colloidal crystals, whose optical properties can generate iridescent colours, provide a means by which photonic crystals may be produced. Further applications range from lasers to display devices, with recent advances demonstrating tunable colours through control of lattice spacing with an external field. Further to the practical importance of colloidal crystals, their well-defined thermodynamic temperature allows colloidal dispersions to be viewed as mesoscopic ` model atoms'. Recently, the ability to tune the colloid-colloid interactions has led to the observation of a wide variety of structures. Of particular interest here, to first order, ac electric fields can induce dipolar interactions between colloidal particles, leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures, some of which are not observed in atomic and molecular systems. External control of the colloid-colloid interactions allows direct observation of phase transitions. Direct microscopic observation at the single-particle level allows an unprecedented level of detail to be accessed. The introduction of a rotating ac field opens up even more possibilities. In this case, the dipolar interactions lead to an attraction in the plane of rotation and to repulsions above and below. Studies with a rotating magnetic field on granular matter indeed produced disc-like patterns consistent with expectations. Unlike granular matter, since colloidal dispersions exhibit brownian motion, thermodynamic equilibrium structures (ie crystals) may be obtained. In previous work, snoswell et al. showed that lattice spacing within quasi-2d colloidal crystals could be controlled in situ by means of coplanar rotating electric field. The interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field may be treated to first order as a circularly symmetric attraction due to the time averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field (1000 Hz). In considering the interactions between particles, the asymmetry between colloids (10nm-1@xmath0 m) and smaller molecular and ionic species must be addressed. A number of coarse-graining schemes have been developed where the smaller components are formally integrated out. This generates a one-component picture, where only the effective colloid-colloid interactions are considered, and the complexity of the description is vastly reduced. The equilibrium behaviour of the colloids in the original multi-component system may then be faithfully reproduced by appeal to liquid state theory and computer simulation. Central to the success of this one-component approach is the use of a suitable effective colloid-colloid interaction.

The development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2D Bose and fermi ultracold gases has also been a significant area of interest. The analysis of 2D and quasi-2D scattering of dipoles has been a key component of this research. The use of a method based on partial wave analysis has been shown to be efficient for describing dipole-dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial waves in the asymptotic region. The study of 2D collisions of unpolarized dipoles has been extended to the case of an orthogonally directed polarization. The method of finding the scattering amplitude on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer has been developed, which permits the description of 2D collisions of unpolarized dipoles. The convergence of the scattering amplitude has been found to be efficient with the use of the sweeping method or LU decomposition. The detailed structure of the matrix of the coefficients has been discussed in the appendix.

160,"<summary>**Turbulence in Quantum Fluids: A New Approach to Understanding Nonlinear Phenomena**</summary>

Turbulence in quantum fluids, such as superfluid helium and one-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), exhibits unpredictable behavior due to the multiple degrees of freedom and nonlinearity of quantum systems. This situation complicates our understanding of turbulence, making it one of the unresolved problems in modern physics. Recent studies in atomic BECs suggest that quantum turbulence (QT) can shed light on understanding turbulence in classical fluids. In QT, the velocity field is disturbed, leading to the formation of tangles and the generation of novel turbulence. The Kolmogorov spectrum is observed in QT, which is related to the vortex dynamics. The study of both sides of turbulence completes the story. In this paper, we treat the problem of turbulence in spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BECs, focusing on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of superfluid velocity is given by *xmath27*, where *xmath28* and *xmath29* are the total particle number. The superfluid velocity is given by *xmath30* by using the Fourier series, and the spectrum for the kinetic energy per unit mass is defined by *xmath33*. The spin-dependent interaction energy per unit mass is defined by *xmath42* where *xmath43* is defined by *xmath44*. The hydrodynamic equations derived from these hydrodynamic equations are derived in *xmath38* and *xmath39*, and the hydrodynamic equations are applied to the spin-1 spinor gp equations.

• White dwarfs, particularly those with masses in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 solar masses, have been found to exhibit molecular and atomic transitions in their spectra, which can be used to study the coupling between the Higgs field and specific curvature invariants, such as the Ricci scalar and the kreschmann invariant.
• The analysis of the pressure shifts in the c@xmath3 bands, which are caused by the Higgs field, has revealed that the presence of nonminimal couplings between the Higgs and spacetime curvature is crucial to various proposals in which the Higgs also plays the role of the inflaton, and as a mechanism to suppress the dark energy contribution of quantum fields to the level compatible with the astrophysical observations based on SNIA.
• The spectroscopic analysis of white dwarf lines, such as the ultraviolet carbon and other metal lines, can help disentangle the pressure shifts from the gravitational redshift measurement, and a detailed scan of the white dwarf spectral energy distribution combined with an updated atmosphere model can help understanding the details of molecular and atomic carbon features.
• Additional objects of this type, such as scalar fields invoked to accommodate the acceleration of the universe, have a compton wavelength that exceeds the one associated with the Higgs field, provided that compact astrophysical sources with non-zero Ricci scalar are found, which can then be used to assess the local gravity and further diversify the sample to counterbalance peculiar systematic effects.
• The spectroscopic analysis presented here could be improved in the near future, with measurements and calculations of pressure shifts of c@xmath97 swan bands under white dwarf conditions being needed, and observations of ultraviolet carbon and other metal lines from lower energy levels being used to help disentangle the pressure shifts from the gravitational redshift measurement.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '•'}"

The provided text discusses a model for strong interactions at low energies, proposed by H. Weyl in 1919. The model is based on the observation that dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat space-time form when subject to a conformally-flat metrical field, instead of the usual Minkowski background. The model describes quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency, independent of flavor mass, inside closed universes, as well as photons that freely travel through flat space-time. The model is based on the assumption that the vacuum expectation values of the respective vacuum expectation values satisfy a relation, which leads to the introduction of two scalar fields that spontaneously break the xmath7 symmetry down to xmath8 and xmath9 symmetry, respectively. The model also includes a symmetric second-order tensor field that serves as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism. The model is further simplified to only its main property, namely its flavor-independent oscillations, which are coupled to the channels of two or more hadronic decay products for which scattering amplitudes can be measured. The model reveals itself through the structures observed in hadronic mass distributions.

• The document discusses the measurement of the longitudinal thermal conductivity in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) using a mixed state model. The authors find that the longitudinal thermal conductivity exhibits fourfold oscillations at temperatures below 1 kelvin, which can be explained by the presence of a predominant gap symmetry. They also measure the angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures for the twinned and untwinned crystals, showing that the symmetry of the angular patterns is related to the temperature. The authors propose a model involving doppler shifts in the energy spectrum of quasiparticles and an impurity scattering rate, which explains the observed oscillations. They also discuss the implications of the observed angular patterns for the thermal transport at different temperatures. The model reproduces the observed oscillations well, suggesting that the gap symmetry is the dominant mechanism at low temperatures. The authors also discuss the implications of the observed angular patterns for the thermal transport at different temperatures, including the possibility of a competition between the thermal activation of quasiparticles in the direction of the thermal current and the gap structure.

The unitarized two-gluon exchange model predicts a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon initiated processes compared to the two-gluon exchange model. The unitarized rpwe framework allows for the inclusion of regularization parameters, which are crucial for capturing the non-perturbative dynamics of color singlet exchange. The analysis shows that the unitarized gluon exchange model can describe the formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events, even though it is an extension of the two-gluon exchange model. The unitarized rpwe framework provides a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data, with the gap survival probability and phase describing the color singlet exchange fractions in partonic subprocesses.</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 4, 'symbol': '*'}"
193,"<summary>Several techniques for forecasting electric energy consumption have been proposed in the last few decades. For operators, energy consumption (load) forecasting is useful for managing power systems. Consumers can also benefit from forecasted information to yield maximum satisfaction. Additionally, load forecasting has been used for system security purposes, such as detecting vulnerabilities in advance. The accuracy of the forecast depends on several factors, including historical load, mean atmospheric temperature, mean relative humidity, population, GDP per capita, and historical trends. Several algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem of electric energy consumption forecasting. The time series approach, functional based approach, and soft computing based approach are some of the methods used. The results of the proposed ann model for forecasting electric energy consumption in the Gaza Strip are presented, and the error criteria used for performance analysis are within tolerable bounds.

• The present invention provides a fabricated implantable nerve guidance conduit (NGC) with integrated spiral structured porous sheets decorated with surface channels and electrospun fibers. Such NGCs offer superior mechanical strength compared to NGCs in the prior art, along with integrated multiple channels, stable aligned fibrous layers, good inter-cell communication, and high surface/volume ratios within the NGCs. Chambers at the distal and proximal ends of the NGC provide additional space for fitting nerve stumps in order to reduce tension at the suture line between the NGC and the nerve stump. A dense outer fibrous tube on the outside of the spiral structured porous sheet can prevent the infiltration of scar tissue while the regeneration process takes place. One embodiment of the NGC of the present invention comprises a three-dimensional (3-D) spiral structured porous sheet having two chambers at the ends thereof. The spiral structure includes a highly porous PCL sheet, which may be formed as a spiral-wound sheet using known methods and decorated with surface channels on a surface of the spiral wound sheet, coated with a thin layer of aligned electrospun fibers on the surface channels, and a dense randomly-oriented fibrous tube on the outside of the NGC. Other bioresorbable materials known for use in the biomedical arts may be used in place of PCL for the sheet and fibers (e.g., collagen/PCL blends for the fibers). 

• Other embodiments of the present invention provide a process for fabricating an implantable NGC, such as the embodiment of an NGC described above, which can be used as a medical device for facilitating the repair and regeneration of nerve tissues.

202,"<summary>Field of Invention: Seat Base Support Assemblies for Furniture</summary>
<summary>Background of Invention: Over the past ten to twelve years, furniture seat spring torsioners such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,210,064, No. 3,388,904, and No. 3,525,514, met the industry's long sought need for deep-drop uplift at the back rail and contributed to the luxury seat. During the past three to four years, however, there has been a move toward thicker and thicker cushions, necessitating the lowering of seat frame heights dramatically. This urgent need was created for more upward resilience of a strong dynamic nature in the spring base. The invention for the first time provides seat spring-enhancing connectors that combine the four essential seat-force-generators: torsion, dynamic uplift, expansion-contraction, and leverage-amplification. These, in turn, produce to the greatest degree the four most desired seat-performance characteristics: initial-drop, deep-drop, softness without oil canning, bucketing, and jack-knifing. The invention can be used with sinuous, arced, or de-arced spring bands, wire grids, chord-rubber webbing, or flexible steel bands. The spring attachment legs are designed to amplify the leverage-induced torque, and the rail-attachment leg is inclined upwardly from the horizontal. The spring-attachment leg is also designed to seat over the penultimate linear segment of the spring band, while the rail-attachment leg seats against the back of the rail. The spring band assembly can be connected to the ultimate linear segment of the band by a conventional VLE clip, and the connector can be used with a conventional EKS clip. The spring band assembly can also be connected to the ultimate linear segment of the band by a conventional SWING ANCHOR connector clip. The spring band assembly can be used with wire grids, chord-rubber webbing, or flexible steel bands. The spring band assembly can be used with sinuous, arced, or de-arced spring bands, wire grids, chord-rubber webbing, or flexible steel bands.</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 6, 'symbol': '*'}"

* The invention describes a process for rapidly assembling DNA sequences for stable integration into plant chromosomes. This approach allows for efficient optimization of sequences to be expressed by testing various transcription, translation assembled units, and different protein fusions or targeting or post-translational modifications.

* The process involves assembly of a DNA sequence of interest from two or more precursor vectors by site-specific DNA recombination. The choice of suitable recombinases/integrases is crucial for high efficiency in planta assembly.

These recombinases/recombination site systems are preferred for this invention.

* The assembly of a DNA sequence of interest from precursor vectors can be facilitated by the presence of helper sequences A′ and B′, which may end up in recombination products that do not contain the DNA sequence of interest. These auxiliary sequences can provide genes of interest for assembly.

* The invention uses a mixture of more than two different precursor vectors for assembling various DNA sequences of interest. The DNA sequences of interest may be the result of random site-specific recombination events between two sets of precursor vectors.

* The assembly of a DNA sequence of interest for stable integration into a chromosome of a plant cell allows for selection of plant cells with the DNA sequence of interest integrated into the chromosomal DNA. The assembly of a functional selectable marker gene is an advantage in some cases, e.g., when the gene of interest is toxic for bacterial cells.

* The assembly of complex vectors in planta from precursor vectors that are of simpler structure can be a further advantage, allowing to avoid complex cloning steps and/or manipulation with unstable DNA structures in bacterial cells. The assembly of DNA sequences of interest for generating different derivative vectors in allelic position toward each other is shown in 12.

256,"<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>

The present invention provides methods and apparatus for accurately detecting, measuring, and removing rotational variability from a covered roll (e.g., sensing roll) used in nip presses. The invention compensates for this effect, allowing a more accurate display of the nip pressure profile to be calculated and displayed. The apparatus includes multiple sensors circumferentially spaced at various cross-directional positions along the sensing roll, which are strategically placed to measure pressure at each CD position. The data collected from these sensors is averaged to provide a more accurate nip pressure profile. The invention can compensate for rotational variability by calculating an average pressure measurement at each cross-directional position, which is then used to create a more accurate nip pressure profile. The results can be displayed on a monitor or other visual screen, and can be used to adjust the nip pressure profile based on the rotational variability. The invention can also be used to compensate for high or low pressure spots along the nip pressure profile.",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 6, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The invention includes a foot pad that attaches to a presser bar and a travelling assembly with an initial position relative to the foot pad. The travelling assembly moves with work fed during the sewing of a buttonhole and includes a slidable member that may be positioned by a button for which a buttonhole is to be sewn. The slidable member carries a tab to actuate a tripping lever on the machine during movement of the assembly and cause the length of a buttonhole formed with the buttonhole device be limited to that suitable for the button inserted in the travelling assembly. An adjustable stop mounted on the travelling assembly engages the tripping lever to terminate the formation of a buttonhole. By properly positioning the stop, an operator can precisely define the closure point and so prevent the formation of an open buttonhole or one in which stitches overlap. The device includes a foot pad, a travelling assembly, and a tripping lever. The device is adapted to control the operation of the tripping lever and flexible contacts to cause the machine to sew a buttonhole when in a buttonhole mode. The device is particularly adapted to accomplish the primary objective of the invention but is generally similar to the device disclosed in U.S. Pat.

259,"<summary>Summary of the Application</summary>

* The application is a continuation of Ser. No. 919,223, filed on October 15, 1986, now abandoned.
* The invention relates to an apparatus for treating a dyed or printed textile web with a liquid.
* German Patent No. 830 040 discloses a technique of spraying a treatment solution onto a moving textile web at several points along the direction of transport, with the solution applied at a certain point being removed by suction before additional solution is applied.
* German Patent No. 830 040 is applicable to knitted fabrics, but not to printed materials.
* As disclosed in German Patent Document No. 23 62 109, an endless sieve belt passes over a pair of guide drums, with cloth spread out on an upper section or segment of the belt, and the cloth is guided on the belt while lying flat and completely slack.
* The distance between the point of application of the liquid and the suction point is relatively short, with the consequence that the liquid has little time to act on the substances to be removed from the web.
* German Petty Patent No. 17 40 815 discloses a boot-like water-filled washing chamber in which the fabric is placed in a stacked configuration, with chamber the fabric being guided on the belt while lying flat and completely slack.
* The distance between the point of application of the liquid and the suction point is relatively short, with the consequence that the liquid has little time to act on the substances to be removed from the web.
* German Petty Patent No. 17 40 815 is applicable to knitted fabrics, but not to printed materials.
* An object of the present invention is to provide an improved apparatus of the above-described type.
* Another, more particular, object of the present invention is to provide such an apparatus in which a washing or rinsing may be adequately effectuated without maintaining the textile web in a stacked configuration.
* The invention is particularly advantageous in that effective washing is possible without soiling a white background, inasmuch as the washing solution is spread onto the textile web and the cloth is neither placed into a stacked configuration nor run through a vat or the like.
* A preferred area of application of the invention is so-called ""soilage washing,"" because considerable amounts of soilage can be removed at relatively little expense.

The present invention provides an arrangement for controlling thread tension in a spool creel, comprising a plurality of controllers that are simultaneously settable by fluid pressure. Each controller is coupled to a different corresponding one of the spool holders. The controllers have a brake rotor and an adjustable, tension-responsive braking element coupled to the brake rotor. The arrangement also has a tensioning lever coupled to the braking element for biasing it. The tensioning lever has a roller adapted to engage and be biased by the threads. This tensioning lever is operable to occupy an angular position dependent upon thread tension and weight. Additionally, a biasing arrangement adapted to be activated by fluid pressure and connected to the tensioning lever, each of the tension levers being simultaneously settable by the fluid pressure. The force generated by the preferred biasing arrangement operates in addition to the weight force on the tensioning lever, whereby the thread tension is also altered. When the warping machine is shut off, the braking force throughout the entire creel can be increased, allowing a quick braking action to be possible. The biasing arrangement operates by fluid pressure, which can influence the tensioning lever without hindering the swinging action necessary for the control procedure. The brake shoe can be held by the tensioning lever, giving rise to a simple construction with few additional parts. The tensioning lever ensures that the braking shoe on restart of the warping machine is removed from contact with the further braking surface, preventing locking. The brake rotor may be a brake drum, wherein the braking element is a braking band contactable therewith and tensionable by the tensioning lever. The braking element is magnetic and can be displaced by the tensioning lever into a position more or less covering the braking disc. The magnetic system can comprise a permanent magnet adjacent one of a pair of legs straddling the braking disc. The brake rotor is a braking disc of electro-conductive material and the braking element is a magnetic system, which is displaceable by the tensioning lever into a position more or less covering the braking disc.

The present invention provides a simplified process for the continuous production of viscose rayon yarns with a high degree of whiteness. The process involves the following critical operations:  
1. Completion of coagulation, which is achieved by passing time without other reagents or liquors except those entrained by the yarn.  
2. Treatment with water having a non alkaline pH, followed by washing under the specified conditions.  
3. Drying, possibly finishing, and drying again.  
The process is carried out at spinning speeds not lower than 90 m/min, and the washing water is weakly acid exchange resin with a pH between 4.0 and 5.5. The criticality of the combination of operations is demonstrated by comparison data with conventional processes, where washing and finishing treatments are required, but not with the preferred conditions of the invention. The degree of whiteness is improved, but not significantly, by the use of weakly acid exchange resin. The invention is not bound to any interpretation of the phenomenon on which the invention is based, and does not go beyond the experimental finding that a simplified, more rapid and more economical process, whenever the conditions of the invention are observed, is always associated with a high degree of whiteness. </summary>",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 1, 'n_sentences_total': 3, 'symbol': '*'}"

295,"<summary>TECHNICAL FIELD</summary>
The invention generally relates to ladders, and more specifically to ladder attachments for positioning the ladder away from the work surface, preventing the ladder from defacing the work surface, and preventing the ladder from slipping or sliding.

<summary>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</summary>
A ladder is used to help people reach places they would not ordinarily be able to reach. Ladders are often used to climb onto roofs of buildings and are used when washing window or painting. In normal use, the bottom portion of the ladder rests on the ground or other surface, and the top end of the ladder typically leans against the building or work surface. The ladder is oriented at an angle which makes it easy for a user to climb up and down the ladder, and also aids in keeping the ladder from slipping. However, typical ladders often rest on the side of the house with the only contact with the house being a small portion of the siderails of the ladder. When a person on the ladder reaches outside the rails, the center of gravity shifts causing one or both rails may slide along the work surface, thereby damaging the work surface. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a ladder that has lateral stability under normal working conditions and resists sliding.

<summary>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</summary>
The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above. Briefly summarized, according to one aspect of the present invention, a brace for a ladder having first and second siderails connected by a rung comprises an extension arm having a flange on one end portion and an opening in the distal end portion. The flange has first and second openings. A U-bolt has its legs inserted through the first and second openings of the flange. The legs have threaded ends and are spaced to receive said ladder rung therebetween. First and second nuts are threadably mateable with the legs of the U-bolt to secure the flange to the U-bolt. A resilient pad assembly is pivotally connected to the extension arm.

The present invention pertains to a collated nail strip formed with a debris-free plastic material for use in a fastener driving tool. The strip is molded onto and adhered to the nails, with the plastic material defining a collar portion that captures or encircles the nail shank and a connecting portion extending between and connecting adjacent collar portions. The plastic material is formulated from an adhesive polymer such as a polyolefin, a polyolefin blend, an epoxy or the like. The strip can be coiled for use in driving tools that accept collations in this manner.

298,"<summary>Field of the Invention</summary>
The present invention relates to position and motion sensors, particularly to sensors that can be multiplexed with other sensors to reduce the number of wires and energy required for monitoring and control of moving objects.

<summary>Background</summary>
Many mechanical systems contain moving parts that require monitoring and control with correction schemes for safe or efficient operation. Position and motion sensors are commonly used in these systems to monitor the position and timing of moving objects.

<summary>Field of the Invention</summary>
The invention provides a method of multiplexing multiple position sensors on a minimum number of wires with a minimum of energy required from each sensor monitoring system.

<summary>Overview</summary>
The invention includes a waveform generator and an error correction generator for modifying a sensing signal by removing unneeded power and providing the signal to a remote monitor via two wires. The waveform generator receives an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer and modifies it in response to an error correction signal for providing a conditioned sensing signal. The error correction generator determines and eliminates strong static signals and error signals that do not deliver information about the position of the object being sensed, and generates a sensor signal output that is close to a desired minimum value.

<summary>Window Reference Circuit</summary>
A window reference circuit constantly compares a desired conditioned sensor signal output to an existing conditioned sensor signal output and adjusts the output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal. The signal processor generates a relatively small reference signal that is large enough to eliminate small values of drift in a negative going direction yet not generate a significant amount of signal due to the discrete nature of the calibration voltages from a DAC and counter combination employed thereby.

<summary>Window Comparator</summary>
A window comparator compares the ideal sensor output to the existing sensor output and adjusts the output if it is below a preset large reference signal or above a preset small reference signal. The comparator generates a low output from the DAC 106 and drives differential amplifier 102 output 102 S low, causing the output 102 S of differential amplifier 102 to rise. The output 102 S of differential amplifier 102 rises above the low end of the window comparator 118 if the sensor output is below the low end of the window.

• The invention proposes a method for compressing natural gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method includes compressing the gas at least during individual intervals to a substantially higher pressure than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by the heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and obtaining the further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure. A compressor station for a gas pipeline for carrying out the method includes at least one compressor for compressing gas, at least one heat exchanger for cooling compressed gas, additionally valve-controlled pipelines for connecting the compressor and the heat exchanger to one another and to the gas pipeline, and control units for controlling the compressor and the valves. The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series. During the warmer period of the year, in which the use of re-cooling units was necessary for ensuring the required exit temperature, the invention provides for a different type of cooling. The invention utilizes the known physical effect according to which a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure, either by throttling or with the simultaneous performance of work. The invention provides that the compression to the excess pressure is carried out in a total of three stages, wherein a predominant portion of the compression takes place in two successive primary stages which are equipped with machines producing approximately the same pressure ratio.

The invention relates to a rolling body guide cage which is produced as such under the influence of forming production steps from at least one ring element and several guide structures arranged in succession in the circumferential direction and in each case provided to guide rolling bodies. The invention furthermore also relates to a method for manufacturing such a rolling body guide cage. 

<summary>Background</summary>
The object on which the invention is based is to indicate solutions by means of which it is possible to reduce the production costs which arise during manufacture of rolling body guide cages. 

<summary>Summary</summary>
Proceeding from the disadvantages set out of the known prior art, the object on which the invention is based is achieved by a rolling body guide cage with a ring element which is produced from a sheet metal material and has an axial profiling formed by forming techniques and several rolling body guide structures which are arranged in succession in the circumferential direction, the ring element being composed of at least two flat material ring segments which are joined to one another in succession in the circumferential direction and are connected, in particular welded, to one another in a production step which precedes the formation of the axial profiling. 

The invention has been shown to be particularly advantageous in particular in the manufacture of rolling body guide cages with an internal diameter of more than 140 mm since the process costs associated with the formation of three weld joints are, at this diameter, already substantially below the material costs of the cutting waste which has hitherto arisen. 

The invention is suitable for the manufacture of radial bearing cages and axial bearing cages, in particular cages of groove and angular ball bearings. The rolling body guide cage can be structured such that it is composed of a first ring element and a structurally identical second ring element positioned in mirror-symmetry. The per se structurally identical ring elements are preferably put together in such a manner that the weld points formed between the ring segments of the ring elements of both ring elements are offset with respect to one another in the circumferential direction, i.e. a weld point is overlapped by an unwelded point. 

The ring segments can be produced in such a manner that they initially have a slight oversize and are initially further cut and where necessary calibrated after welding in the context of a contouring step. However, the ring segments can in principle also be cut to their final dimensions in terms of their material width and are subsequently only formed and where necessary punched internally.

The invention relates to waveguide holograms for illuminating objects with specific illumination requirements. These holograms can be used to illuminate display holograms or spatial light modulators. The invention includes a thin substrate waveguide optically coupled to a coherent light source, which provides extremely high diffraction efficiencies. Non-uniformity of the diffracted wavefront in the direction of propagation can be compensated for by exposing a photographic emulsion to the beam without compensation. The hologram can be recorded non-uniformly, so that the reconstructed beam is uniform in intensity. Both corrections can be employed. The invention also includes a method for selectively illuminating demanding objects, such as holograms and spatial light modulators. The illumination system can occupy less space than conventional lens illumination systems. The invention has advantages in terms of absence of stray light and uniform illumination. However, it may not achieve high efficiency over large area holograms due to the non-uniformity of the diffracted wavefront. The invention also has potential solutions for two-sidedness and polarization analysis. The configuration of the waveguide hologram can be modified to achieve higher spectral selectivity. The invention has been disclosed with reference to generic description and specific embodiments. The examples set forth are not intended to be, and shall not be construed as, limiting in any way.

By a functional memory is understood a memory in which updates, such as additions, are carried out in such a way that first the path from the root of a tree-shaped structure to the point of updating is copied, and thereafter the update is made in the copied data (i.e., the update is not directly made to the existing data). Such an updating procedure is also termed “copy-on-write”.  
<summary>Background of the Invention</summary>
In overwrite memory environments, in which updates are not made in the copy but directly in the original data (overwrite), a FIFO queue is normally implemented by means of a double-ended list of the kind shown in FIG. 1. The list comprises nodes of three successive elements in a queue, three of such successive nodes being shown in the figure (references N(i−1), Ni and N(i+1)). The element on the first edge of each node has a pointer to the preceding node in the queue, the element on the opposite edge again has a pointer to the next node in the queue, and the middle element in the node has either the actual stored data record or a pointer to a record (the figure shows a pointer).  
<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>
The idea of the invention is to implement and maintain a queue by means of a tree-shaped structure in which the nodes have a given maximum size and (1) additions of data units (to the queue) are directed in the tree-shaped data structure to the first non-full node, seen from below, on the first edge of the data structure and (2) deletions of data units (from the queue) are also directed to a leaf node on the edge of the tree, typically on the opposite edge. Furthermore, the idea is to implement the additions in such a way that the leaf nodes remain at the same hierarchy level of the tree-shaped data structure, which means that when such a non-full node is not present, new nodes are created to keep the leaf nodes at the same hierarchy level. The tree-shaped data structure will also be termed shortly a tree in the following.

* The invention is a novel electron multiplier design that uses thin foils to multiply electrons in a series of transmission stages. Foils are used to accelerate electrons emitted from the back of one foil to an energy level that effectively transmits the electrons through the next foil in the series, generating secondary electrons that add on to the transmitted electrons and continue on to the next foil in the series. The foil electron multiplier can be used for amplification of an incident electron flux or for detection of particles (e.g., photons, ions, electrons, and the like). The foil electron multiplier has a thin foil thickness and a resistor divider between each foil with an applied voltage V APP, which accelerates secondary electrons between successive stages in the multiplier. The foil electron multiplier can span a large active area and is used in photomultiplier tubes and particle detectors, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates. The foil electron multiplier has a mean gain of approximately 1.88, which is higher than the gain of conventional electron multipliers. The foil electron multiplier can be used for ion detection and position-sensitive information on where an incident particle impacted a stage of the foil electron multiplier.

The invention relates to the fabrication of semiconductor structures, particularly capacitors, MOS transistors, and electrooptic applications, using high-dielectric oxide materials. High-dielectric oxide materials provide advantages such as ferroelectric properties and size reduction of capacitors. Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric materials are convenient due to their low annealing temperatures and desirable properties in small grains. The integration of non-SiO2-based oxides directly or indirectly on Si is difficult because of strong reactivity with oxygen. A Ge buffer layer on Si oxidizes less readily and can be used to prevent or minimize the formation of a low dielectric constant layer. The use of a second ferroelectric layer as a buffer layer allows many stable ferroelectrics, such as BaTiO3, to be used in RAMs. The use of a second buffer layer of SrTiO3 or some other stable ferroelectric allows even chemically reactive ferroelectric oxides to be used.

The invention provides a receiver input circuit that eliminates unwanted signal actuation of non-linear components in the signal path, taking into account adequate small signal behavior and using conventional components. The circuit includes a control loop for amplification control, with the control signal derived from the intermediate frequency signal and supplied to the part of the circuit preceding the mixer stage, and an outer control circuit that includes the intermediate frequency amplifier. The control signal for the first control circuit is obtained at the output of the preamplifier stage, for the second control circuit at the output of the mixer stage, and for the third control circuit in the signal frequency selective intermediate frequency amplifier. The circuit achieves the following tasks:

1. First amplification control circuit: Avoids unwanted overloading of the mixer stage and/or varactor diodes, if the second control circuit is inactive. The effective band width is approximately identical with the transmission band width of the network 5 (HF selective filter) and the signal response threshold for control application is below the modulation limit for the mixer input or--if applicable--the varactor diodes of the selective filter 5. The maximum response threshold is determined by the fact that no relaxation oscillations or control oscillations occur in the given frequency and level range, even if its amplitude is modulated.

2. Second amplification control circuit: Avoids overloading of the mixer stage (also on the output side) as well as frequency influences acting upon the oscillator because of powerful usable signals to which the receiver is tuned, or by means of spurious signals in close proximity to the frequency. The effective band width is less than that of the first control circuit but greater than that of the third control circuit and it corresponds approximately to the selective characteristics of the intermediate frequency filter 7. The signal response threshold is set lower than that of the first control circuit.

3. Third amplification control circuit: Supports the other control circuits, with the effective band width and signal response threshold lower than for the second control circuit. The control circuit according to the invention based on a PIN diode also has the advantage that the following amplifier component is protected against high-voltage discharge surges from the antenna.

412,"* The Comanche program was established in 1983 to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet. The contractor team of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Helicopter Company were expected to design a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing the primary missions of armed reconnaissance and attack. Critical to achieving these capabilities are the successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, advanced avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals in order to realize significantly lower operating and support costs predicted for this program and achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day. In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program as part of efforts to meet budgetary constraints. The Secretary’s restructure decision reduced funding for the program from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. In addition to extending the development phase by 3 years, it also called for two flyable prototypes to be produced and the Comanche production decision to be deferred. In response to the Secretary’s decision, the Army proposed a program restructure that would allow it to acquire, within the Secretary’s funding constraint, six aircraft in addition to the two prototypes by deferring developmental efforts to fiscal year 2002 and beyond. DOD approved the proposal in March 1995. The Army’s restructuring of the Comanche program continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and of higher program costs. The Comanche was originally justified to the Congress as a relatively inexpensive aircraft. However, since 1985, the program has experienced significant increases in program acquisition unit cost. Funding reductions have caused the program to undergo significant restructuring, resulting in sharp decreases in planned acquisition quantities and lengthening of development schedules, thereby increasing Comanche program costs. In 1985, the Comanche had estimated total program acquisition unit cost of about $61 billion for 5,023 aircraft (or $12.1 million per aircraft). In 1992, we reported that (1) as of October 1991, the program acquisition unit cost had increased to $27.4 million, (2) acquisition quantities had been reduced to 1,292 aircraft, and (3) future increases in cost per aircraft were likely",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 20, 'symbol': '*'}"
413,"• The Food Stamp Program provides eligible low-income households with paper coupons or electronic benefits that can be redeemed for food in stores nationwide. FNS funds food stamp benefits and about half of the states' administrative costs and establishes regulations for implementing the Food Stamp Program. FNS regulations require that states certify household eligibility at least annually and establish requirements for households to report changes that occur after they are certified. Recently, FNS introduced several options and waivers to food stamp rules and regulations in order to increase program access and reduce the reporting burden on working families while minimizing the potential for payment errors. These include options and waivers related to program eligibility, reporting requirements, extending food stamp benefits to households leaving TANF, and options related to TANF recipients. To monitor program accountability, FNS’s quality control system measures states' performance in accurately determining food stamp eligibility and calculating benefits. States implement the Food Stamp Program by determining whether households meet established limits on gross income and assets, calculating monthly benefits for eligible households, and issuing benefits to households. The actual amount of the food stamp benefit is based on household income after certain deductions, including shelter, dependent care, and child support. To be eligible for benefits, a household’s gross income may not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level and the value of its assets may not exceed $2,000. If the household owns a vehicle worth more than $4,650, the excess value is included in calculating the household’s assets. Recipients of TANF cash assistance are automatically eligible for food stamps—a provision referred to as ""categorical eligibility""—and do not have to go through a separate food stamp eligibility determination process. In the wake of welfare reform, many needy families that are no longer receiving TANF cash assistance may receive other TANF-funded services or benefits. FNS gave states the option to extend categorical eligibility to families receiving TANF-funded benefits or services. States can determine which TANF-funded services or benefits confer categorical eligibility to food stamps. FNS offers two options that states can use to allow households to own a vehicle worth more than the amount allowed in current regulations and remain eligible for food stamp benefits. One option allows states to replace the federal food stamp vehicle asset rule with the vehicle asset rule from any TANF assistance program, as long as the rule is more liberal than the federal rule. States adopting the rule of a TANF-funded program must apply it to all applicants for food stamp benefits.

• The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) was established in 1976 and amended in 1984 to govern the management of hazardous waste from generation to disposal. RCRA governs the identification, listing, and management of hazardous waste, including the identification of waste that should be classified as hazardous.
• RCRA contains provisions governing the identification and listing of hazardous waste. EPA has established criteria for identifying waste that should be classified as hazardous. Some types of waste are listed by their source, such as electroplating, which generates sludge from wastewater treatment.
• RCRA’s regulations govern all hazardous waste, regardless of where or how it is generated. Waste from both current and past industrial operations is regulated. The requirements apply to any waste that EPA has identified as hazardous or, under its ""contained-in"" policy, to any environmental medium, such as soil or groundwater, that has been mingled with an identified hazardous waste until the medium no longer contains the waste.
• Waste associated with cleanups (often referred to as remediation waste) must generally be managed under RCRA if it contains a hazardous component. The waste generated at a wide variety of cleanups, including those under RCRA, Superfund, and state enforcement and voluntary programs, must generally be managed under RCRA’s stringent requirements.
• Both the Congress and EPA have considered proposals to amend the application of RCRA’s requirements to remediation waste. Since 1995, several legislative proposals have been introduced that would exempt certain types of remediation waste from these requirements and give the states the authority to establish their own requirements for managing this waste. Likewise, in 1995, the administration, as part of its effort to reinvent government, tasked EPA with identifying for statutory reform any RCRA provision whose implementation incurred costs that far outweighed the environmental benefits achieved.
• Since 1995, several legislative proposals have been introduced that would exempt certain types of remediation waste from these requirements and give the states the authority to establish their own requirements for managing this waste. EPA has identified RCRA remediation waste as a key area. In April 1996, EPA proposed a comprehensive rule that would have provided alternative ways of managing remediation waste. However, in September 1997, the agency announced plans to withdraw its proposed rule because, among other things, stakeholders disagreed on many remediation waste issues.

In 1998, following a presidential call for VA and DOD to start developing a ""comprehensive, life-long medical record for each service member,"" the two departments began a joint course of action aimed at achieving the capability to share patient health information for active duty military personnel and veterans. Their first initiative, undertaken in that year, was the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project, which aimed to create an electronic interface that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities to access data from any of the other agency's health information systems. The interface was expected to compile requested patient information in a virtual record that could be displayed on a user's computer screen. In our reviews of the GCPR project, we determined that the lack of a lead entity, clear mission, and detailed planning to achieve that mission made it difficult to monitor progress, identify project risks, and develop appropriate contingency plans. In 2001, we recommended that the participating agencies (1) designate a lead entity with final decision-making authority and establish a clear line of authority for the GCPR project and (2) create comprehensive and coordinated plans that included an agreed-upon mission and clear goals, objectives, and performance measures, to ensure that the agencies could share comprehensive, meaningful, accurate, and secure patient health care data. In 2002, we recommended that the participating agencies revise the original goals and objectives of the project to align with their current strategy, commit the executive support necessary to adequately manage the project, and ensure that it followed sound project management principles. VA and DOD took specific measures in response to our recommendations for enhancing overall management and accountability of the project. By July 2002, VA and DOD had revised their strategy and had made progress toward being able to electronically share patient health data. The two departments had refocused the project and named it the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) program and, consistent with our prior recommendation, had finalized a memorandum of agreement designating VA as the lead entity for implementing the program. This agreement also established FHIE as a joint activity that would allow the exchange of health care information in two phases. ● The first phase, completed in mid-July 2002, enabled the one-way transfer of data from DOD’s existing health information system (the Composite Health Care System, CHCS) to a separate database that VA clinicians could access. ● A second phase, finalized in March 2004, completed",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 6, 'symbol': '•'}"

432,"* The electricity industry is composed of four distinct functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. Once electricity is generated, it is sent through high-voltage, high-capacity transmission lines to local distributors. Once there, it is transformed into a lower voltage and sent through local distribution lines for consumption by industrial plants, businesses, and residential consumers. Because electricity is generated and consumed almost instantaneously, the operation of the electricity network requires that a system operator constantly balance the generation and consumption of power. Utilities and others own and operate electricity assets, which may include generation plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations. Utilities may be owned by investors, municipalities, and individuals (as in cooperative utilities). System operators manage the electricity flows using control systems—IT- and network-based systems that monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions, including opening and closing circuit breakers. As the electricity industry has matured and technology has advanced, utilities have begun taking steps to update the electricity grid—the transmission and distribution systems—to integrate new technologies and additional IT systems and networks. Despite these efforts, the electricity industry faces challenges related to cybersecurity, including the lack of technologies to monitor and control the flow of electricity, the need for better communication networks, and the need for more comprehensive cybersecurity standards. The industry and government stakeholders have begun to articulate a broader, more integrated vision for transforming the electricity grid into one that is more reliable and efficient, facilitating alternative forms of generation, and giving consumers real-time information about fluctuating energy costs.",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 12, 'symbol': '*'}"

OSC, an office within Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt, has an agreement with ARC, an office within Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt, to provide contracting support for a fee. This type of fee-for-service procurement process generally involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services. The requiring agency officials determine the goods or services needed and, if applicable, prepare a statement of work, sometimes with the assistance of the ordering agency. The contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or order is properly awarded or issued (including any required competition) and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements. If contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer's representative—generally an official at the requiring agency with relevant technical expertise—is normally designated by the contracting officer to monitor the contractor's performance and serve as the liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor. While interagency contracting can offer the benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness, this approach needs to be effectively managed. Due to the challenges associated with interagency contracts, we recently designated interagency contracting as a governmentwide high-risk area. As authorized by OSC’s appropriation, OSC may use 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants. Section 3109 permits agencies, when authorized by an appropriation or other statute, to acquire the temporary or intermittent services of experts or consultants. Under the statute, appointments of experts and consultants may be made without regard to competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements. Individuals appointed under this authority may not be paid in excess of the highest rate payable for a GS-15 unless a higher rate is expressly provided for by statute or an appropriation. Under section 3109, OPM is responsible for prescribing criteria governing circumstances in which it is appropriate to employ an expert or consultant and for prescribing criteria for setting pay. Section 3109 of title 5 and OPM’s implementing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 304 provide for broad discretion in the appointment of experts and consultants. In promulgating its regulations, OPM recognized that agencies need to obtain outside opinion and expertise to improve federal programs, operations, and services and that by bringing in the talent and insights of experts and consultants, agencies can work more economically and effectively. OSC’s primary mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited personnel practices.

• The VA mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans, ensuring they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. It is the second largest federal department and operates in 167 medical centers, 800 community-based outpatient clinics, 300 veterans centers, 56 regional offices, and 131 national and 90 state or tribal cemeteries throughout the nation. The department relies on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits.
• The IT infrastructure is critical to VA’s efforts to provide benefits and services to veterans. As such, the department operates and maintains an IT infrastructure that is intended to provide the backbone necessary to meet the day-to-day operational needs of its medical centers, veteran- facing systems, benefits delivery systems, and all other IT systems supporting the department’s mission.
• The department has identified several IT challenges, including the failed modernization of a system, suspended development of another system, and the extent of system interoperability with DOD. The department has recommended several actions to improve key systems development and acquisition processes essential to the second outpatient scheduling system effort.
• The VA has engaged in several near-term efforts focused on expanding interoperability between its existing electronic health record systems and those of DOD. The department has developed a plan for its VistA modernization effort, including an interoperability plan and a road map for functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018.

446,"* FAA's funding structure is primarily supported by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from a series of excise taxes paid by users of the NAS. The Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through the dedicated excise taxes. In most years, General Fund revenues have been used to fund FAA. About $2.6 billion was appropriated for fiscal year 2006 from the General Fund for FAA’s operations. This amount represents about 18% of FAA’s total appropriation. The Trust Fund was established by the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 to help fund the development of a nationwide airport and airway system. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA’s two capital accounts—the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account—which provide grants to airports and funds for modernizing the air traffic control system, respectively. The Trust Fund also provides funding for the Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account and supports part of FAA’s Operations account. To fund these accounts, the Trust Fund is credited with revenues collected from system users through the dedicated excise taxes. In fiscal year 2005, the ticket tax was the largest single source of Trust Fund revenue, followed by the international departure and arrival tax, the passenger segment tax, and fuel taxes (see table 1 for a description of current taxes). The administration's reauthorization proposal would change FAA’s financing system from one based mainly on excise taxes to one based more on cost-based charges. Under the proposed system, funding for ATO would come primarily from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft. In addition, contributions from the General Fund would be appropriated to FAA to cover ATO costs of providing services to military and other public aircraft, flight service stations, and a few other services. Funding for AIP, EAS, and part of RE&D would come from an equal fuel tax on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers. Funding for Safety and Operations would include some fees, but mostly General Fund contributions. The reauthorization proposal would also create an advisory board and give FAA limited borrowing authority. * The reauthorization proposal would change FAA’s budget structure by establishing two new budget accounts—(1) Air Traffic Organization and (2) Safety and Operations—to align with FAA’s lines of business and proposed funding. These two new accounts would replace the Operations and F&E accounts.

474,"• Medicare is a federal health insurance program designed to assist elderly and disabled beneficiaries. Hospital insurance, or part A, covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and certain home health services. Supplemental medical insurance, or part B, covers physician and outpatient hospital services, laboratory and other services. Claims are paid by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers. Intermediaries process claims from hospitals and other institutional providers under part A while carriers process part B claims. The intermediaries’ and carriers’ responsibilities include: reviewing and paying claims; maintaining program safeguards to prevent inappropriate payment; and educating and responding to provider and beneficiary concerns. Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from that of most federal programs. Most federal agencies, under the Competition in Contracting Act and its implementing regulations known as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), generally may contract with any qualified entity for any authorized purpose so long as that entity is not debarred from government contracting and the contract is not for what is essentially a government function. Agencies are to use contractors that have a track record of successful past performance or that demonstrate a current superior ability to perform. The FAR generally requires agencies to conduct full and open competition for contracts and allows contractors to earn profits. Medicare, however, is authorized to deviate from the FAR under provisions of the Social Security Act enacted in 1965. For example, there is no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts. Rather, intermediaries are selected in a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association. When one of the local Blue plans declines to renew its subcontract, the Association nominates the replacement contractor. Carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers, and the number of such companies seeking Medicare claims-processing work has been dwindling in recent years. The Social Security Act also generally calls for the use of cost-based reimbursement contracts under which contractors are reimbursed for necessary and proper costs of carrying out Medicare activities but does not expressly provide for profit. Further, Medicare contractors cannot be terminated from the program unless they are first provided with an opportunity for a public hearing––a process not afforded under the FAR. Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms. Freeing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis from a broader array of entities able to perform needed tasks would enable Medicare to benefit from efficiency and performance improvements related to competition. It also could address concerns about the dwindling number of insurers with which the",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27, 'symbol': '•'}"

Federal agencies face ongoing challenges in protecting privacy and ensuring compliance with privacy laws, particularly in the context of data mining and RFID technology. The Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government Act of 2002 provide limitations on agencies' collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The Fair Information Practices, outlined in the Privacy Act, are a set of principles for protecting privacy and ensuring that personal information is handled in a fair and transparent manner. Agencies must notify the public by system-of-records notice when establishing or making changes to a system of records. They must define and limit themselves to specific predefined purposes, and conduct PIA (Privacy Impact Assessment) before developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates information that is in a personally identifiable form. The E-Government Act of 2002 aims to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems and information collections by requiring agencies to develop agencywide information security programs. The Fair Information Practices are a set of principles for balancing privacy with other public policy interests, and the version shown in table 1 was issued by the OECD in 1980.

• The NCIC system, managed by the FBI, is a comprehensive computerized criminal justice information system that serves as a repository for data on crimes and missing persons. It includes approximately 35,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the United States, with 85,820 active records in its missing persons file as of January 1, 2011. The system is managed cooperatively by FBI's CJIS (Division) and the state and local agencies that access it. The FBI's Advisory Process, consisting of an Advisory Policy Board with representatives from criminal justice and national security agencies, and working groups, is responsible for establishing policy for NCIC use by federal, state, and local agencies and providing advice and guidance on all CJIS Division programs. The Board creates ad hoc subcommittees as necessary to review policies and develop alternatives or recommendations for the Board's consideration. The Board also requires that each local LEA appoint a Terminal Agency Coordinator who serves as the representative and point of contact for disseminating information on NCIC policies and procedures to that agency. The Board's audit of CSAs is conducted by the CSA, which is a criminal justice agency that has overall responsibility for administering NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and ensuring LEA compliance with operating procedures within its jurisdiction. The Board's audit of CSAs consists of a pre-audit questionnaire, on-site visit, and follow-up report. The pre-audit questionnaire is sent to CSAs and selected LEAs within the state to obtain written responses as well as assist CJIS in gathering the relevant information to better inform the audit process. In selecting LEAs, CJIS takes into account a number of factors, including the number of records entered by each LEA, the total number of records to be reviewed in the state, the LEA's geographic location to reduce the time and travel burden imposed on CJIS audit staff, whether the LEA was previously found to have extensive and/or serious NCIC noncompliance issues, and whether CSA officials request that CJIS include the LEA in its audits based on CSA concerns from prior CSA audits. The on-site visit consists of interviews of CSA and LEA personnel to determine compliance with NCIC policies and procedures, and a data quality review of selected LEA NCIC records. In designing its review of these records, CJIS seeks to balance the need for a cost-effective, logistically feasible approach, with the need to ensure the review obtains statistically valid information on the",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The U.S. government faces serious acquisition workforce challenges (e.g., size, skills and knowledge, and succession planning). Key program staff rotate too frequently, promoting myopia and reducing accountability (i.e., tours based on time versus key milestones). Additionally, the revolving door between industry and agencies presents potential conflicts of interest. Inadequate oversight has resulted in little or no accountability for recurring and systemic problems. Lack of high-level attention reduces the chances of success in the acquisition, contracting, and other key business areas. The acquisition workforce’s workload and complexity of responsibilities have been increasing without adequate agency attention to the workforce’s size, skills and knowledge, and succession planning. This situation is made all the more challenging by the increasing use of contractors to support program operations because of the additional oversight needed. Though many agencies lack good data on their workforces, it is clear that the size of the workforce has declined, while the size of government expenditures for goods and services has risen significantly. These trends represent a major challenge to the current workforce—dealing with a significantly increased workload. At the same time that the federal acquisition workforce has decreased in numbers and the size of its investments in goods and services has increased significantly, the nature of the role of the acquisition workforce has been changing and, as a result, so have the skills and knowledge needed in that workforce to manage more complex contracting approaches. One way agencies have dealt with this situation is to rely more heavily on contractor support. For example, DOD is relying on contractors in new ways to manage and deliver weapon systems. On the basis of our work looking at various major weapon systems, we have observed that DOD has given contractors increased program management responsibilities to develop requirements, design products, and select major system and subsystem contractors. In part, this increased reliance has occurred because DOD is experiencing a critical shortage of certain acquisition professionals with technical skills related to systems engineering, program management, and cost estimation. Without adequate oversight by and training of federal employees overseeing contracting activities, reliance on contractors to perform functions that once would have been performed by members of the federal workforce carries risk. As I noted earlier, the use of lead system integrators is being undertaken by agencies when they believe they lack the expertise needed to manage complex acquisitions. Our concern over the skills and knowledge of the workforce extends beyond DOD. At times skills may be in short supply in both government and the private sector. For example, in December 2006 we reported that employees with certain information technology skills are in short supply in both",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The MAF is a data file that contains a list of all known living quarters in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Bureau uses the MAF to support the decennial census as well as the American Community Survey and other ongoing demographic surveys. The MAF contains address information, census geographic location codes, and source and history data. In conjunction with the MAF, the TIGER contains spatial geographical information that allows information from the MAF to be mapped. For the 2010 Census, the Bureau updated the MAF through a complete address canvassing that verified virtually every existing MAF address and added new addresses and deleted those that no longer exist. While full address canvassing helped ensure the accuracy of the address list, we believe it was also very costly. According to Bureau decision documents leading up to the 2010 Census, the Bureau canceled planned research on the feasibility of targeting its canvassing when prioritizing its research agenda early in the decade given its funding levels. As part of the Bureau’s effort to conduct the 2020 Census at a cost lower than the 2010 Census, the Bureau is researching the feasibility of conducting targeted address canvassing, verifying addresses in only select areas that are more likely to require updates to the address list. To support targeted address canvassing, the Bureau plans to increase its reliance on other previously used sources of updates, including U.S. Postal Service files, commercial database files, and significant input from state and local governments. For example, GSS-I is working to allow government agencies at all levels to more regularly share and update their address lists with the Bureau throughout the decade (rather than solely 2 years prior to the decennial, as had been the case in prior decennial censuses) so that fewer areas need to be fully canvassed. The life cycle for 2020 Census preparation is divided into five phases, as illustrated in figure 1. The Bureau intends to use the early research and testing phase through fiscal year 2015 to develop a proposal for conducting targeted address canvassing that considers both cost and quality implications. By the end of the early research and testing phase, the Bureau plans to complete decisions about preliminary operational designs rather than continuing critical research and testing until the end of the decade as it did for the 2010 Census. The Bureau faces legally mandated deadlines for delivering census tabulations. Effective scheduling is critical for ensuring that the Bureau adheres to a timeline that meets these deadlines.",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

According to the 1992 congressional testimony, thieves turn stolen cars into money in three ways: by taking cars to a ""chop shop,"" obtaining an apparently valid title for the car, and exporting the vehicles for sale abroad. The task force established in 1993 to study problems related to motor vehicle titling, registration, and salvage, may affect motor vehicle theft, and recommend ways to solve these problems, including obtaining uniform national uniformity that is necessary in these areas and related resources and (2) other needed legislative or administrative actions; review by January 1, 1994, state systems for motor vehicle titling and determine each state's costs for providing a titling information system; and establish the title information system by January 31, 1996, unless Transportation determines that an existing system meets the statute's requirement, and by January 1, 1997, report to Congress on those states that elected to participate in the information system and on those states not participating, including the reasons for nonparticipation. The title information system is intended to enable states and other users (e.g., law enforcement officials) to instantly and reliably determine, among other things, (1) the validity of title documents, (2) whether an automobile bearing a known identification number is titled in a particular state, and (3) whether an automobile titled in a particular state is, or has been, junked or salvaged. The task force, established in April 1993, reported in February 1994 its recommendations on the legislative and administrative actions needed to address problems in the areas of titling, registration, and controls over salvage to deter motor vehicle theft. The task force recommended, among other things, (1) the passage of federal legislation that would require uniform definitions for terms such as salvage vehicles and uniform methods for titling vehicles, (2) possible funding sources to pay for and maintain the titling system, and (3) penalties to enforce compliance by the participating states.

534,"• The report analyzes the most recently available public data from the IRS's Statistics of Income (SOI) to provide an overview of who claims itemized deductions, what they claim them for, and the amount in deductions claimed.
• The revenue loss associated with several of the larger deductions is presented using data from the Joint Committee on Taxation's (JCT's) tax expenditure estimates.
• This report concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of various policy options to reform or limit itemized deductions.
• More in-depth discussion on options for reforming itemized tax deductions, as a whole or individually, can be found in other CRS reports.
• Individual income tax filers have the option to claim either a standard deduction or the sum of their itemized deductions on the federal income tax.
• The standard deduction is a fixed amount, based on filing status, available to all taxpayers.
• Tax filers may claim itemized deductions, but must report each item separately on their tax returns and be able to provide documentation in the event of an IRS audit.
• The tax benefit of choosing to itemize is the amount that their itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction multiplied by their top marginal income tax rate.
• Some itemized deductions can only be claimed if they meet or exceed minimum threshold amounts (also known as a floor) to simplify tax administration and compliance.
• Floors usually come in the form of a limit based on a percentage of AGI.
• Some itemized deductions are subject to a cap (also known as a ceiling) in benefits or eligibility.
• For example, the itemized deduction for home mortgage interest can only be claimed for the value of interest payments made on the first $1 million of mortgage debt.
• The report uses publicly available tax data from the IRS to provide a profile of itemizers and some insight into trends among various itemized deduction provisions.
• Itemized deductions are often grouped together in broader discussions of tax policy, in part because they are grouped together on the tax Form 1040.
• However, itemized deductions exist for a variety of reasons and are designed in ways such that they target (or exclude) certain types of tax filers.
• Analysis of data on these deductions can inform these discussions over reforming one or more itemized deduction provisions.
• Specifically, the data analysis in this report intends to identify who claims itemized deductions, for how much, and for which provisions.
• Tax filers in higher-income ranges claimed deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate are charged with drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies. Title I of the annual THUD appropriations bill generally funds DOT. The department is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization. Its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation, providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways, transit, airport, and intercity passenger rail infrastructure, while overseeing safety in all modes of transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exceptional among DOT's large sub-agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the U.S. air traffic control system. In support of that task, it employs over 80% of DOT's total workforce, roughly 46,000 of DOT's approximately 56,000 employees. Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill generally funds HUD. The department's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs—Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance—account for the majority of the department's funding. Two block grant programs—the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)—help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Other, more specialized grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to homebuyers with low down payments, often first-time homebuyers, and to buyers and developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill generally funds a collection of agencies involved in transportation or housing and community development. They include the Access Board, the Federal Maritime Commission, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Amtrak Office of Inspector General (IG), the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (often referred to as NeighborWorks), the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the costs associated with the government conservatorship and regulation of the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The goal is to prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein, which would encourage the use of domestically produced protein and raise milk prices for dairy farmers. Opponents argue that this would increase costs and result in higher retail food prices.
• The U.S. dairy program supports prices of dairy products and pays farmers subsidies when milk prices decline below certain levels. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates import quantities during 2000-2004 at about 3% of milk production, driven primarily by cheese imports.

550,"* The federal government first supported a program for energy storage and electric power system technology during the 1970s, before the establishment of the Department of Energy (DOE). In those early days, the program was focused mainly on energy storage—especially to even out the variable power production from rapidly growing use of wind and solar technologies—but also to support large coal and nuclear power plants. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has expanded the ability of grid operators to monitor and control electric power flows. The subsequent increase in networking of computerized devices for grid data collection and control advanced the ability of operators to anticipate, avoid, and otherwise mitigate potential power crises, such as blackouts. However, in more recent years, Internet-connected networks have become vulnerable to unwanted computer-driven intrusions and disruptions, revealing a new cybersecurity challenge for electric power systems. The nation's energy infrastructure is diverse. It includes a variety of transmission and distribution system network structures (electricity, oil, and natural gas), an array of operating models (public and private), and a variety of hardware and software. The energy sector consists of thousands of electricity, oil, and natural gas assets that are dispersed geographically. Thus, interdependency within the sector and across the nation's critical energy infrastructure sectors is significant. Coordinating the security and resilience of energy assets is complicated by the virtually borderless nature of energy use and the reliance on predominantly privately-owned infrastructure. Key challenges and opportunities facing the electric power industry include a changing power generation mix, replacing aging infrastructure (transmission, storage, distribution, and generation); modernizing and securing communication networks (e.g., analog to digital); accommodating new end-use technologies (for solar and other distributed resources); planning for increased interdependencies of natural gas, water, and electricity systems; and devising business models to manage the challenges while providing reliable and affordable electricity. These activities are constrained by the need for cost control, physical security, cybersecurity, improved system resiliency, and the flexibility to adapt to weather and market uncertainties. Further opportunities arise from growing use of shale gas production and decreasing costs for information technologies which allow improved grid control and more opportunities for customer management of power use. The DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is charged with a mission to support more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. To achieve that mission, OE supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research and development (R&D), demonstration projects, partnerships, facilitation",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The campus-based programs, including FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan, were created to provide financial aid to students who demonstrated financial need. These programs are unique in that they are designed to target students with the highest need and are based on institution-specific award criteria rather than non-discretionary award criteria such as Pell Grants and Direct Loans. The campus-based programs' authorizations of appropriations, along with many other provisions under the Higher Education Act, expired at the end of FY2015. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, most recently through the Continuing Appropriations Act 2018 (P.L. 115-56 ), which extended funding for the programs through December 8, 2017. The Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015 (Extension Act; P.L. 114-105 ). The Extension Act prohibits future appropriations for the Perkins Loan program and prohibits an automatic extension of it under the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA; P.L. 90-247, as amended). The campus-based programs are among the oldest of the federal financial aid programs. As federal aid has largely transitioned to a system that allows for ""portability"" in receipt of student aid, meaning that most forms of aid are made available to students at whichever participating institution a student chooses to attend, the campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort. For example, of the approximately $125 billion of federal aid that was made available to students through programs authorized under the HEA in FY2016, 76% was through the Direct Loan program, 21% through the Pell Grant program, and 2% through the campus-based aid programs. The HEA authorizes most of the federal programs that provide direct financial aid to postsecondary students. As lawmakers consider reauthorization of the HEA, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered. These include the extent to which the campus-based programs provide types of aid to students that are not provided via other postsecondary aid programs, whether the current formula for allocating funds to institutions is optimal, and the potential role of the campus-based aid programs in a redesigned federal aid system.

* Water infrastructure systems, including dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipes, are critical to the nation's water supply, transportation, and electricity infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, including physical disruption, bioterrorism/chemical contamination, and cyber attacks. Damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt the delivery of vital human services, endanger public health and the environment, or cause loss of life. <br>
* Since most water infrastructure is government-owned, it may serve as a symbolic and political target for some. This report presents an overview of the large and diverse sector, describes security-related actions by the government and private sector since 9/11, and discusses additional policy issues and responses, including congressional interest. <br>
* The potential for terrorism is not new. In 1941, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote, ""It has long been recognized that among public utilities, water supply facilities offer a particularly vulnerable point of attack to the foreign agent, due to the strategic position they occupy in keeping the wheels of industry turning and in preserving the health and morale of the American populace."" <br>
* Water infrastructure systems also are highly linked with other infrastructure systems, especially electric power and transportation, as well as the chemical industry which supplies treatment chemicals, making security of all of them an issue of concern. These types of vulnerable interconnections were evident, for example, during the August 2003 electricity blackout in the Northeast United States: wastewater treatment plants in Cleveland, Detroit, New York, and other locations that lacked backup generation systems lost power and discharged millions of gallons of untreated sewage during the emergency, and power failures at drinking water plants led to boil-water advisories in many communities. Likewise, natural disasters such as the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and 2007 Mississippi River floods caused extensive and costly damage to multiple infrastructure systems—transportation, water, electric power, and telecommunications. Broadly speaking, water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources of untreated water for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and household needs; dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipes that contain and transport raw water; treatment facilities that remove contaminants from raw water; finished water reservoirs; systems that distribute water to users; and wastewater collection and treatment facilities. Across the country, these systems comprise approximately 77,000 dams and reservoirs; thousands of miles of pipes, aqu",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 12, 'symbol': '*'}"

Perkins IV requires eligible recipients to establish measures for each of the indicators. Perkins IV specifies, however, that measures of student attainment may include student achievement on technical assessments that are aligned with industry-recognized standards, if such assessments are available and relevant. Perkins IV also adds five core indicators of performance at the postsecondary level. Perkins IV requires eligible recipients to negotiate adjusted levels of performance for each of the core indicators for which they will be held responsible. Perkins IV also requires eligible recipients to establish levels of performance for each of the core indicators in their local plans. Perkins IV also requires eligible agencies and recipients to disaggregate the data for each of the indicators of performance, including any additional indicators selected by the eligible agency or recipient, based on the categories of students included in Title I-A of the ESEA for data reporting purposes.

The federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer taxes for 2014 were phased out over a 10-year period, leaving the gift tax as the only federal transfer tax in 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 temporarily reinstated the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes with lower top rates and larger exemptions. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently extended the estate tax rules, except for the top tax rate, which increased from 35% to 40%. The federal estate and gift taxes are unified as they utilize the same rate structure. The federal estate tax is a tax on the estate of a decedent, levied against and paid by the estate. The inheritance tax is imposed on and paid by the heirs of the decedent based upon the money or property that they receive. The determination of federal estate tax liability involves a series of adjustments and modifications of a tax base known as the ""gross estate.""

The United States and New Zealand have returned to a high level of security cooperation, forging a new security partnership between the two countries. The two nations, which fought together in many of America's wars and established the Australia-New Zealand-United States (ANZUS) alliance in 1951, are once again close security partners in the Asia Pacific and beyond. New Zealand's nuclear policies in the mid-1980s that prohibited nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered ships from entering New Zealand ports led the United States to restrict bilateral defense cooperation with New Zealand. For many years this difference largely defined the relationship between the two nations. Recent developments, while not restoring the formal alliance relationship, have greatly bolstered practical aspects of the two nation's bilateral defense and security cooperation as well as reaffirmed an overall close United States bilateral relationship with New Zealand. The extent to which the nuclear issue had been put into the past was demonstrated when President Obama invited Prime Minister John Key to attend the Nuclear Summit in April 2010 and stated that New Zealand had ""well and truly earned a place at the table. "" New Zealand was the only non-nuclear state invited to the conference. Several organizations and groups, some involving Members of Congress, help promote bilateral ties between the United States and New Zealand, including the United States-New Zealand Council in Washington, DC, and its counterpart, the New Zealand-United States Council in Wellington; the Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus and its New Zealand parliamentary counterpart; and the more recent Pacific Partnership Forum. The U.S.-N.Z. Council was established in 1986 to promote cooperation between the two countries and works with government agencies and business groups to this end. The bipartisan Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus was launched by former Representatives Jim Kolbe, Ellen Tauscher, and 52 other Members in February 2005. The caucus has included over 60 Members of Congress. Representative Kevin Brady has since replaced Kolbe as the Republican co-chair of the caucus.

575,"* TAA (Trade Adjustment Assistance) provides federal assistance to workers who involuntarily lose their jobs due to foreign competition. Eligible workers receive funding for training and reemployment services as well as income support while enrolled in training. Workers may also be eligible for other benefits, including a tax credit equal to a portion of qualified health insurance premiums. TAA was reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA, Title IV of P.L. 114-27). Reduced barriers to international trade are widely acknowledged to offer benefits to consumers in the form of increased choices and lower prices. Expanded trade may also offer expansionary opportunities to firms that produce goods or services that see increased exports. Reduced barriers to trade may, however, have concentrated negative effects on domestic industries and workers that face increased competition. TAA is designed to provide readjustment assistance to workers who suffer dislocation (job loss) due to foreign competition or offshoring. Generally, TAA provides a more robust set of benefits and services than would be available to a worker who lost his or her job for reasons other than foreign competition. TAA is designed to assist workers who have been adversely affected by reduced trade barriers and increased trade. Its availability to workers who are adversely affected by declines in international trade may be limited. TAA was created in 1962 and, historically, has been reauthorized alongside expansionary trade policies. A detailed legislative history of the program is in the Appendix. In June 2015, TAA was reauthorized by TAARA. The eligibility and benefit provisions of TAARA are authorized to continue through June 30, 2021.

• The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (P.L. 106-78, Title IX; LMR) requires that meat packers report prices and other information on purchases of cattle, hogs, lamb, boxed beef, wholesale pork, and lamb carcasses and boxed lamb to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Authority for mandatory reporting was set to expire on September 30, 2015. Livestock industry stakeholders supported the reauthorization of the act, and producer groups put forward proposals amending mandatory reporting.
• The House passed a reauthorization bill (H.R. 2051) in June 2015. In September 2015, the Senate amended the House-passed bill, and Congress reauthorized LMR until September 30, 2020, in the enacted Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-54).
• Before livestock mandatory price reporting was enacted by Congress in 1999, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) collected livestock and meat price and related market information from meat packers on a voluntary basis under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. §1621 et seq.).
• AMS market reporters collected and reported prices from livestock auctions, feedlots, and packing plants. The information was disseminated through hundreds of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual written and electronic USDA reports on sales of live cattle, hogs, and sheep and wholesale meat products from these animals.
• The goal was to provide all buyers and sellers with accurate and objective market information. By the 1990s, the livestock industry had undergone many sweeping changes, including increased concentration in meat packing and animal feeding, more production specialization, and more vertical integration (firms controlling more than one aspect of production). Fewer animals were sold through negotiated (cash; or ""spot"") sales, and more frequently sold under alternative marketing arrangements (e.g., formula sales based on a negotiated price established in the future) with prices not publicly disclosed or reported. Some livestock producers, believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine ""fair"" market prices for livestock going to slaughter, called for mandatory price reporting for packers and others who process and market meat.

• The increased presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and in the scientific workforce has been and continues to be of concern to some in the scientific community. Enrollment of U.S. citizens in graduate science and engineering programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students in those programs. A significant number of university faculty in the scientific disciplines are foreign, and foreign doctorates are employed in large numbers by industry. Those in the scientific community, arguing for ceilings on admissions for immigrants, maintain that foreign students use U.S. graduate education programs as stepping stones to immigration through sponsorships for legal permanent residence. Approximately 56% of foreign doctorate degree earners on temporary visas remain in the United States, with many eventually becoming citizens. Data on adjustments from temporary visas to permanent status reveal that approximately 6 in 10 new permanent residents occurred in both 2007 and 2008 from adjustments of status admissions. In 2008, approximately 15.0% of those individuals awarded legal permanent resident status resulted from employment-based preferences. Few will dispute that U.S. workers are adversely affected by the entry of foreign scientists and engineers, who reportedly accept lower wages than U.S. citizens would accept in order to enter or remain in the United States. These arguments occur in the context of a debate on projections and potential imbalances in certain scientific and technical disciplines. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that between the years 2006 and 2016, employment in science and engineering fields will increase at a faster rate than other professional groups. The growth rate will result, primarily, from growth in mathematics and computer-related occupations. Much attention in the scientific community has focused on the H-1B temporary admissions program. A report of the National Science Foundation (NSF) during the late 1980s claiming a nationwide shortage of scientists and engineers may have contributed to the decision by Congress to expand the skilled-labor preference system contained in the Immigration Act of 1990. The 1990 legislation more than doubled employment-based immigration, including scientists and engineers entering under the H-1B visa category. The act raised the numerical limits or ceilings on permanent, employment-based admissions, from 54,000 to 140,000 annually. In addition, the legislation ascribed high priority to the entry of selected skilled and professional workers, and simplified admissions procedures for foreign nationals seeking to temporarily work, study,",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15, 'symbol': '•'}"

The funding level Congress decides to provide for FY2018 could impact goals set by EERE and priorities identified in the Administration's FY2018 budget request. President Trump submitted his FY2018 budget request to Congress on May 23, 2017. The budget requests $28.2 billion for DOE, a decrease of nearly $3 billion, or 9.5%, from the FY2017 enacted level. Nearly half of the reduction ($1.5 billion) in the DOE budget request would come from EERE programs. The request specifies two EERE program eliminations: the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. The funding level Congress provides could affect continued support for these programs and other efforts within EERE including sustainable transportation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. This report discusses the FY2018 EERE budget request and the proposed EERE funding levels and priorities in the related E&W appropriations bills. It does not discuss the opportunities, challenges, economic value, or commercial status of the various renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency initiatives selected by EERE, nor does it delve into the goals of the individual EERE programs or congressional oversight of certain EERE issues. EERE leads the DOE's effort to support research, accelerate development, and facilitate deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. EERE is led by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and it is organized into four offices: Office of Transportation, Office of Renewable Power, Office of Energy Efficiency, and Office of Operations. EERE contends that it invests in what it considers to be the highest-impact activities. The office collaborates with industry, academia, national laboratories, and others to develop technology-specific road maps and then focuses funding on early stage R&D, technology validation and risk-reduction activities, and the reduction of barriers to the adoption of market-ready new technologies. EERE also manages a portfolio of research and development programs that support state and local governments, tribes, and schools. In addition, EERE oversees the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)—the only national laboratory solely dedicated to researching and developing renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. EERE funding is provided from the annual E&W appropriations bill.

The reports do not provide in-depth analysis of specific issues related to mandatory funding—such as retirement pay—nor do they systematically follow other legislation related to the authorization or amending of DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. Discussion of appropriations legislation involves a variety of specialized budgetary concepts. The appendix to CRS Report R44053, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2016, explains several of these concepts, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25). A more complete discussion of those terms and the appropriations process in general can be found in CRS Report R42388, The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction , by [author name scrubbed], and the Government Accountability Office's A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process . Except in summary discussions and when discussing total amounts for the bill as a whole, all amounts contained in the suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority and are rounded to the nearest million. However, for precision in percentages and totals, all calculations were performed using unrounded data. Data used in this report for FY2015 amounts are derived from the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 114-4 ) and the explanatory statement that accompanied H.R. 240 as printed in the Congressional Record of January 13, 2015, pp. H275-H322.

• The text emphasizes the distinction between net job loss and gross job loss, highlighting that gross job loss is a significant economic problem that can be mitigated through fiscal and monetary policies.
• It discusses the role of trade, trade deficits, offshore outsourcing, overseas investment, and economic restructuring in causing gross job loss, but notes that none typically cause net job loss.
• The text also mentions that barriers to gross job loss, such as trade barriers and offshore outsourcing, can lead to lower gross job gains, making such barriers self-defeating.
• The text concludes by suggesting that policymakers should find the right balance between mitigating risk and maintaining market dynamism in an increasingly fluid labor market.

Congress has historically used commemorative legislation to name federal buildings, post offices, postage stamps, and other public works. Legislation requiring legislation to name post offices or other federal buildings is waived by unanimous consent on at least one occasion. Commemorative legislation can be used to name post offices for individuals, groups, and events, such as the establishment of a national memorial or the creation of a commemorative commission. Commemorative legislation can also be used to honor individuals, groups, and events, such as the creation of a national holiday or the establishment of a commemorative commission. Members may give floor speeches, send flags, and purchase American flags to honor constituents or groups. Members may also use official funds to purchase flags flown over the Capitol building. The House and Senate have different rules regarding commemorative legislation, with the House allowing bills to be considered under suspension of the rules and the Senate prohibiting consideration of commemorative legislation without a minimum number of bipartisan cosponsors.

597,"* The 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) provides new long-term counter-cyclical support for grains and cotton, replacing target prices and deficiencypayments with fixed, ""direct payments"" to farmers. Both types of payments will be available to producers with annual agreements with USDA. The measure maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiencypayments as they are now, with changes in most loan rates. The new law, which covers the 2002-2007 crop years, brings soybeans and the minor oilseeds (e.g., sunflowers, etc.) fully under the support program rules that apply to grains and cotton. In a major departure from the past, FSRIA redrew the support system to operate like that for grains, oilseeds, and cotton, instead of the traditional system of peanut marketing quotas and nonrecourse price support loans. The new counter-cyclical program will be decoupled from current output, with producer payments not tied to current production or prices. * The 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) obligates countries to discipline their agricultural subsidy programs and reduce import barriers to promote more open trade. Under the URAA, the United States is committed to providing subsidies of no more than $19.1 billion per year through domestic farm policies with the most potential to distort production and trade. The URAA contains detailed rules for how countries should determine which of their programs must be counted toward their assigned subsidy limits (e.g., $19.1 billion for the United States). Generally, however, programs that are tied to current prices or current production must be counted (these are called ""amber box"" policies). * The new counter-cyclical assistance in the 2002 law focuses on the ""major"" commodities -- grains, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, and milk. These generally are the most widely produced, but that still leaves much of U.S. agriculture ineligible for such payments, raising questions of equity among commodities, and of the potential for distorting production toward items that might receive more support (contributing to surplus production). * The 1994 URAA also includes a provision for the United States to provide direct payments to farmers who are unable to produce any particular crop now to receive the payments. However, because (like marketing loan gains) the target price deficiency payments would be triggered by current market prices, they are expected to be placed",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The study investigates the expression and function of tgm2, a marker for m2 macrophages, in rat renal allografts during acute rejection episodes. It demonstrates that tgm2 is overexpressed by mononuclear leukocytes, predominantly by activated monocytes, accumulating in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts on day 9 after transplantation. The study also shows that tgm2 expression is induced in graft tissue upon allogenic transplantation, but no quantitative changes were detected in the protein level. The results suggest that tgm2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute rejection, as it can induce apoptosis and stabilize dying cells, preventing cell rupture and release of proinflammatory cytoplasmic components. The study also highlights the potential role of tgm2 in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection, as it can contribute to the reversion of acute rejection in experimental models of renal fibrosis.

614,"<summary>Summary of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Pathogenesis, Treatment, and Biomarkers</summary>

• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third most common cause of global cancer-related mortality. It disproportionately impacts developing countries and males, with 85% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia, and a worldwide male: female sex ratio of 2.4. Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C infections, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases like hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

• HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy, likely due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products like heat shock 70 and p-glycoprotein, and p53 mutations. Currently, systemic therapeutic options in locally advanced or metastatic HCC are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting raf kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

• HCC development is multifactorial and is influenced by dysregulation of multiple pathways including Wnt/b-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) axis is crucial for normal processes like embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair.

• HGF is a ligand for the met receptor, also known as cellular met or cmet, and plays a key role in mammalian development, including morphogenesis, mitogenesis, and motogenesis. It is regulated by paracrine ligand delivery, ligand activation, and autocrine signaling.

• Dysplastic nodules progress to early HCC through cumulative genetic alterations, while advanced HCC often involves intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion. Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades.

• The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is multifactorial and is influenced by dysregulation of multiple pathways including Wnt/b-catenin",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16, 'symbol': '•'}"
615,"<summary>Diabetes and Cancer: A Complex Association</summary>
Diabetes and cancer are two closely related conditions that have been the subject of intense debate for over a century. The length of this debate suggests that any such associations are relatively weak, and most practicing diabetologists do not view cancer as a specific, diabetes-associated risk. The association between diabetes and cancer is further complicated by the fact that insulin, which is increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes, is used in various forms to treat the condition. The study of glargine, a newer form of insulin, has shown potential mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on cancer cells, but the clinical implications remain controversial. The association between diabetes and cancer is also complicated by the fact that the association between diabetes and cancer is not directly related to the risk of cancer. The evidence presented in the diabetologia papers is insufficient to establish that there is a case to answer, but it is important to consider the long-term effects of diabetes itself, insulin treatment, and specifically, glargine, on cancer development. Further research is needed to address the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues, and secretagogues, and to explore potentially protective effects of metformin and the most tantalizing question: why is diabetes not more strongly associated with cancer?</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 6, 'symbol': '*'}"

617,"<summary>Research on Antireflection Layers in High-Efficiency Solar Cells</summary>

* Antireflection (AR) technology plays a crucial role in the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells by increasing light coupling into the active region of devices. Generally, a relatively low-light reflectivity can be obtained for crystalline silicon solar cells by combining surface texturization with six-nanometer thin-film deposition. However, to further reduce the light reflectivity for the improvement of solar cell efficiency, various nanostructures with size comparable to the wavelength of the incident light have been proposed, such as photonic crystals, porous structures, plasmoids, monics, and dielectric nanoparticles. All these nanostructures should be based on wide-bandgap materials that themselves cannot absorb sunlight. The zno material has a wide-bandgap, which has been widely used in fields such as photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices. For photovoltaic applications, the zno nanostructures as antireflective layers can be fabricated by various approaches, such as pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition, vapor-liquid-solid growth, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical deposition technique. The zno nanowiskers (nws) with different lengths have been grown by the seeding and growth two-step process, and integrated into the fabrication of CZochralski silicon solar cells based on the current standard celling technology. The density and length of the zno nws have been optimized for the improvement of solar cell performances by controlling the time of growth. The results show that the efficiency of CZ silicon solar cell can be improved by a value of 3% relatively using the zno nws as the antireflective layer in practice. The starting samples are p-type CZ silicon solar cells fabricated by a standard process including surface texturization, phosphorus diffusion, six-nanometer film deposition, screen printing, and metallization. The seed layer of zno was first deposited on the front surface of solar cells by a magnetron sputtering system. The deposition temperature is 150°C, and the seed layer thickness is about 10 nm. After protecting the parts without the zno seed film with waterproof tapes, the samples were immersed in the solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (zn(no3)26h2o) and (ch2)6n4 mixture for 30 to 60 minutes for the growth of zno nw.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome characterized by degeneration of both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons with intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Although the clinical diagnosis of PD is often straightforward and robust, the correct diagnosis can be challenging, especially in clinically mild or uncertain cases. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have improved diagnostic accuracy. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands 24 and sympathetic innervation of the heart 1,5 have become popular and widely used in clinical practice. For example, imaging of DAT binding with [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-n-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) successfully visualizes presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract. DAT spect abnormalities can help differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy. Meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy in pd patients with decreased cardiac MIBG uptake compared to other PD patients with normal cardiac MIBG uptake is also useful. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined use of FP-CIT and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in differentiating PD from non-PD are 93% and 47%, respectively.

• Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria that deserve considerable interest for their use as natural and nontoxic food preservatives, as well as for their potential use in human and veterinary applications, and in the animal production field.
• In 1976, tagg et al. defined bacteriocins as proteinaceous compounds that kill closely related bacteria but are now recognized as having broad-spectrum activity across genera.
• The classification of gram-positive bacteriocins is difficult because of their heterogeneity and the need for continuous evolution in classification schemes.

1. The main concern is to ensure the highest possible standard for the services provided and to meet the needs of individual service users and communities.
2. Clinical governance (cg) is introduced as a strategy to improve quality of health care services in Iran.
3. The classic definition of cg is provided by Scally and Donaldson.
4. The iranian ministry of health and medical education (mohme) has applied cg as a framework for improving quality and safety in hospitals since 2009.
5. The cg model consists of seven interlocking components: clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, risk management, patient and public involvement, education and training, staff and staff management, and use of information.
6. The system awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication are considered as foundation of this model.
7. The iranian medical universities have developed a qualitative research to explore senior managers' viewpoints on cg implementation barriers and facilitators.
8. The study found that senior managers accepted that improving quality of health care should be integral to their role and essential to safeguard patient care.
9. The study also found that senior managers declared that having adequate knowledge about clinical governance also positive attitude toward the necessity of the program are the main factors affecting clinical governance implementation.
10. The study concluded that senior managers' perceptions about cg implementation factors were classified in five main domains: knowledge and attitude, culture, organizational factors, managerial factors, and barriers.
11. The study highlighted the importance of staff involvement in cg implementation, including team-based approaches, clear vision and goals, and effective communication.
12. The study emphasized the need for top management support to successfully implement cg, including clear commitment, realistic timetables, and appropriate organizational changes.
13. The study also suggested that employees should be involved in cg implementation to ensure successful outcomes.
14. The study found that cg implementation barriers include lack of adequate managerial support, insufficient resources, structural and cultural issues, and professional boundaries.

631,"<summary>Summary of the Review on Outcome Measures Used in Stroke Self-Mismanagement</summary>

* The review examined the methodological quality of outcome measures used in stroke self-mismanagement according to the criteria outlined by the Cosmin checklist. Consistent with measurement theory, the review explored the validity and reliability of these measures for use in people with stroke, not their general use in broader populations. The review found that no study adopted a measure of stroke self-management attitudes or behaviors, which will first be addressed. The range and number of different published outcome measures adopted by studies in this review may suggest a current lack of consensus regarding the appropriate measures to assist evaluation of stroke self-mismanagement. The review highlights that the reported theoretical drivers within stroke self-mismanagement are unclear, not least because they are often not explicitly stated by researchers. The heterogeneity of the outcome measures utilised by stroke self-mismanagement may indicate a difficulty in determining the expected outcomes of stroke self-mismanagement. A systematic review demonstrated that interventions with specific aims, such as reduced systolic blood pressure in hypertension or glycosylated haemoglobin levels in diabetes, produced greater effect sizes than those without defined outcomes. Further work is therefore warranted to conceptualise stroke self-mismanagement and examine the theoretical premises supporting such interventions, and expected outcomes so that appropriate outcome measures which accurately reflect the concept can be selected and/or developed.

633,"<summary>Our study demonstrated that a high-fat diet combined with short-term ovariectomy promoted an increase in body weight gain and a decrease in metabolic efficiency, accompanied by hyperleptinemia. The cytokine content in liver and gastrocnemius muscle was unchanged, while all cytokines analyzed were decreased in mes adipose tissues. The hyperlipidic diet caused a decrease in il-6 and il-10 levels in mes adipose tissues, but ovariectomy had the opposite effect, and the tnf- content of ret adipose tissues was high following ovariectomy. The serum levels of triacylglycerol (tg) were decreased in the sham h group compared with the sham c group. The serum insulin concentration was lower in the sham h, ovx c, and ovx h groups than in the sham c group. The ovariectomy group showed an increase in serum leptin levels compared with all other groups. The hyperlipidic diet caused a decrease in il-10 levels, but ovariectomy had the opposite effect, and the tnf- content of ret adipose tissues was high following ovariectomy. The il-6 receptor, tnf receptor, tlr-4, and myd88 protein content did not differ between groups in the liver (figure 6), gast (figure 7), and mes adipose tissues (figure 8). In this study, we demonstrated that a high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy may cause a decrease in energy expenditure and an increase in adipose tissue deposits, possibly via enhanced uptake of tg from chylomicrons. The results suggest that this treatment is insufficient to restore these parameters, although there is a 77% reduction in the expression of lpl, which would reduce fat deposition by decreasing fatty acid uptake from the circulation. However, this is inconsistent with studies in which estrogen replacement managed to recover both body weight and adiposity index in female control rats. This discrepancy may be related to the structural form of estrogen used, in addition to the dosage and duration of estrogen replacement and the age at which the female rats were ovariectomized. The results suggest that ovariectomy promotes hyperphagia and weight gain, although this hyperphagia is transitional, the gain in body weight is more durable. The presence of female hormones could modify the response to a high-fat diet in terms of il-6 adipose tissue content, especially in ret adipose tissues.

Recent studies have prompted researchers to delve deeply into the altered microbial composition in patients suffering from ibd. This may be associated with a general reduction of bacterial diversity and shifts toward certain bacterial groups and the appearance of previously unidentified species. Changes may be driven by environmental cues and genetic predispositions. The gut flora, liver function, glucose metabolism, and control of behavior are all implicated. The gut microbiota has been attributed a role in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Nalfld). The interdependence between microbiota, metabolism, and inflammation is also highlighted. The gut flora can affect host responses, including host genotype, environment, and diet. The microbiota exerts its effects on the intestine through bacterial signaling molecules and metabolic products. Components of the microbiome can also enter the circulation, be transported to various organs, and potentiate multiple effects in these organs. The gut brain axis can circumvent intestinal absorption and may allow the microbiome to directly affect the brain. The oral cavity has one distinct advantage over the gut tract: accessibility. The gut microbiota is slowly beginning to reveal many of its secrets. Future research should desist from chasing purely metagenomic queries.

* The Weibull analysis is more stringent than the comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the Mantel-Cox or Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests, implemented in GraphPad Prism 5.01.
* The significance of the differences in body weights between the treated and control groups was judged using a linear mixed effects model (19,20) as described previously (15).
* Food consumption was determined by totaling the amount eaten by each treatment group during each time period, adjusted for the number of mice.
* The study used a mixed effects model with a bic model selection criterion to assess the effects of ndga on body weight and other parameters.
* The results suggest that the effects of ndga on drosophila lifespan were not due to cr or altered locomotor activity.
* The study did not detect a disequilibrium between food intake and weight in this species.
* The results indicate that ndga can extend murine and drosophila lifespan.
* The study found that ndga consumption, even at doses below its therapeutic dose, was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis.
* The drug also increased the lifespan of drosophila, suggesting its target(s) and mechanism(s) of action may be phylogenetically conserved.

* Genetic variation contributes to both disease susceptibility and treatment response.
* Genome-wide association studies (GWA) have enabled rapid discovery of genetic variants contributing to the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases.
* Promoting personalized medicine will improve medical decision-making.
* Although use of the term personalized medicine is often limited to the identification of optimal drug and dosage for subgroup patients, current personalized medicine applications are far more broad and might include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
* In prostate cancer, for example, dna biomarker tests may be used to determine whether treatment may be safely delayed for a period of watchful waiting.
* In contrast, in other instances, genetic profiles may be used to determine preventive interventions.
* This approach is already used for some forms of hereditary cancer, in which individual genetic testing is the basis for deciding on specific, sometimes very radical interventions such as preventive surgery (Kroll et al., 2008).
* Beyond treatment schemes that are applied identically across large subgroups of patients, to which some authors have applied the term ""stratified medicine"" (Trusheim et al., 2007).
* Other personalized medicine applications offer targeted treatment options for individual patients.
* Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as anti-tnf, anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-1, are thought to be effective in inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn's disease (Buchner et al., 2008).
* Other molecules seem suitable for use as anti-inflammatory therapy as well.
* To choose one or a combination of different anti-inflammatory therapies, the physician might first obtain the genetic profile of a patient by sequencing.
* Depending on the individual DNA profile, the physician might select the anti-inflammatory combination therapy, which may include many different molecules.
* However, foundational to personalized medicine, biological markers, biomarkers for short, are diversely defined in the literature.
* Gallo et al. (2011) summarize some of the definitions, and observe that the most commonly adopted definition states that a biomarker is any substance or biological structure that can be measured in the human body and may influence, explain or predict the incidence or outcome of disease.
* However, it is a matter of debate whether the qualification that biomarkers must be measured in the human body is a reasonable limitation.

• The study evaluated several surrogate variables for predicting wound healing in advanced diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) using intralesional rhegf injections.
• The authors tested the surrogate variables proposed for neuropathic DFUs and explored their correlation with complete healing during follow-up for 1 year.
• The study included 13 patients randomized to intralesional rhegf injections at 75 g or 25 g, three times per week, and 16 patients to placebo.
• The results showed that the 25- and 75-g dose levels were used according to the product label, and rhegf treatment was administered up to complete granulation or a maximum of 8 weeks.
• The study confirmed that the predictive property of percent area change, log healing rate, and ratio of log area could be extrapolated to more complicated, ischemic, larger, and Wagner grade 3 or 4 ulcers.
• The cutoff points for classification were not the same, with the correct classification percent in the present series being < 70% and negative pvs < 60.
• The extrapolation of the cutoff points proposed in the present work has the limitation of the small sample size analyzed, so further research is needed.
• The study provides the first evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced DFUs.
• The surrogate markers can easily be applied by clinicians due to the measurement of the proportion of wound area covered by granulation tissue being part of routine clinical care. </summary>",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

• MS is classified into relapsing-remitting and progressive forms, with relapsing-remitting being the most common. The exact cause of MS is unknown, but several factors, including genetic and environmental factors, are believed to play a role.
• Researchers have investigated the role of interleukin-25 (IL-25) in MS. IL-25 is a cytokine that plays a key role in stimulating and developing T helper 2 (Th2) responses. It is involved in the control of the immune system, including the endothelial cells, th1 and th17 cells, and the main cells involved in the pathogenic activities of the immune system.
• The c424c / a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene has been identified as a potential candidate for investigation in the pathogenesis of MS. The polymorphism may be associated with MS, and further research is needed to confirm this.
• The study evaluated the association between the c424c / a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population. The results showed that 1 to 2% of patients had the aa genotype, while 16 to 47% had the ac and 47 to 66% had the cc genotype. The chi-square test revealed that the frequency distribution of genotypes was not statistically different between patients with MS and controls.

The study evaluated the entire aorta diameter, from the thoracic aorta to the abdomen aorta, using axial images of non-contrast CT scans in a population with multiple risk factors for both coronary heart disease (CHD) and aortic aneurysms (AA). The study population included high-risk individuals but blood pressure and serum lipids were well controlled, with prevalence of taa being considerably high and associated with various clinical factors, including older age, larger aortic root, higher diastolic blood pressure, and absence of dyslipidemia. The study also found that taa was associated with the absence of dyslipidemia, while aaa was significantly associated with the presence of dyslipidemia. The results highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between taa and aaa, as they are both associated with increased age and hypertension. The study also found that taa prevalence continuously increases, and is thought to be related to increased age and hypertension in the general population. The prevalence of taa was significantly higher in elderly Korean males with hypertension compared to other populations, and the study suggests that race influences aaa prevalence and that asians generally have a low prevalence of aaa. The results of the study highlight the need for clear definitions of the usefulness of routine screening for aaa among Asian non-smokers.

1. The document discusses the use of phosphatases as potential candidates for synthetic applications, highlighting their efficiency and ability to catalyze hydroxy groups.
2. Phosphatases are enzymes that transfer phosphate groups from high-energy inorganic phosphates onto various hydroxylated compounds.
3. The document mentions that phosphatases are widely used in various chemical processes, including phosphorylation, synthesis, and catalysis.
4. The use of phosphatases for synthetic applications dates back to the late 1940s, when axelrod and appleyard achieved transphosphorylation using phosphatase-enriched extracts and pnpp or phenolphthalein phosphate as donor.
5. The document also discusses the mechanism of phosphatetransferring phosphatases, which form a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate that undergoes either nucleophilic attack by water or accepts a suitable nucleophile.
6. The document notes that the use of phosphatases for synthetic applications is currently limited due to the difficulty in recycling cofactors and the need for a high substrate load to achieve high product titers.",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 24, 'symbol': '•'}"

1. The text discusses the phenomenon of non-native invasions, which have been noted for centuries, including the phylloxera, chestnut blight, and brown tree snake.
2. Charles Elton's book on non-native invasions did not inspire a broad research thrust on invasions or a widespread public and policy response to their growing number.
3. In the mid-1980s, an international project engaged over 100 scientists worldwide, producing several widely read edited volumes, and triggering an explosion of research on invasions, which has been recognized as one of the great ongoing global environmental changes along with climate, nutrient cycle enhancement, and land use changes.
4. The surge of research included studies on how particular non-native invaders eat native species, compete with them, infect them, and sometimes compete with them while vectoring diseases to them.
5. Two new lines of research have become increasingly prominent, indicating that impacts of introduced species are more varied and widespread than had previously been thought.
6. The phenomenon of invasions has been studied at the ecosystem level, particularly in new centuries, showing how a single introduced species can change processes or the physical structure of an ecosystem, or both, sometimes subtly and slowly, but in such a way as to affect a large fraction of the resident species.
7. The introduction of new species can lead to the emergence of new invasive species, which can be more harmful than the original introduced species.
8. The lag effect, the subtlety of some impacts that have been occurring from the outset of the introduction, and the greater propensity for non-native species to cause harm mean that the suggestion to manage invasions only after impact is evident is ill advised.
9. The efforts to prevent invasions or to reverse or mitigate their impacts are not hopeless, but they are not effective in preventing planned introductions that would likely lead to invasions.
10. The rapid pace of research on invasions and the increasing number of cases of invasions suggest that the problem of invasions is growing and is becoming more urgent.
11. The text concludes by emphasizing that the problem of invasions is not futile, but it is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address it.

Vidian canal schwannomas can present with various clinical symptoms, including headache, facial pain, and dryness of the nasal mucosa, and can be associated with compression of the internal carotid artery or bulging through the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus. Treatment options include biopsy-proven schwannomas, including endoscopic surgery, single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, and conventional fractionated radiotherapy using stereotactic radiotherapy.

* The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing over the past few decades.
* The most dangerous characteristic of melanoma is that it can spread widely via the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels.
* Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that links clinical dermatology and dermatopathology by enabling the visualization of morphological features that are not discernible by examination with the naked eye.
* Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis as compared to unaided eye with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 1030%.
* However, dermoscopy may actually lower the diagnostic accuracy in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists due to this method requiring great deal of experience to differentiate skin lesions.
* Only experts have arrived at 90% sensitivity and 59% specificity in skin lesion diagnosis, while for less trained doctors these figures show significant drop till around 62%-63% for general practitioners.
* The main problem is that the diagnosis is highly dependent on subjective judgement and is scarcely reproducible.
* Several scoring systems and algorithms such as the abcd-e rule, the seven-point checklist, three-point checklist, and the menzies method have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of less experienced clinicians.
* Although these simplifications have enabled the development of these diagnostic algorithms with good accuracy, still they showed problems that have not yet been solved.
* The most important shortcoming is that the purpose for which they were designed was not achieved, because the within- and between- observer concordance is very low, even for expert observers.
* Despite extensive research in investigating the varied presentations and physical characteristics of melanoma, there is a growing interest in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by elm techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions.
* The importance of the topic is patent if we analyse the enormous quantity of research works related with the melanoma diagnosis.
* Numerous computerized diagnostic systems have been reported in the literature where different border detection, feature extraction, selection, and classification algorithms are used.
* Some researchers have reviewed and tried to critically examine image analysis techniques for diagnosis of skin cancer and compared diagnostic accuracy of experts dermoscopists with artificial intelligence and computer aided diagnosis.
* More research, however, is needed to identify and reduce uncertainties in the automatic decision support systems to improve diagnosis accuracy.
* A comprehensive up-to-date review of automatic diagnostic model for skin lesions is not available.
* Continuous emergence of new classification algorithms and techniques",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40, 'symbol': '*'}"

• The treatment of gallstones and cholelithiasis is expensive, with an estimated annual cost of more than $5 billion. The National Institutes of Health convened a consensus development conference in September 1992 to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. After considerable discussion and review of the current literature, the panel concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered substantial advantages over the traditional open cholecystectomy with no apparent increase in morbidity or mortality. The conference concluded that treatment costs would be equal to or slightly less than the cost of open cholecystectomy and that there would be substantial savings to patients and society because of the shortened period of disability. The decision tree analysis showed that reducing the charge for laparoscopy by applying reusable instruments and having advanced laparoscopic skills would make laparoscopic cholecystectomy more cost-effective.
• The study evaluated matched pairs of patients in a large data set to determine the true charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including increased operative time, anesthesia time, cholangiograms, instruments, etc. The main independent variable remaining is the charge for laparoscopy. The decision tree analysis showed that managed care contractors would prefer open cholecystectomy for all patients with cholecystitis at Maricopa Medical Center (MMC). However, most patients would not enroll in a health plan or go to a hospital which did not provide laparoscopic cholecystectomy, so an evaluation of what could be done to reduce the charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy must be done to make laparoscopic cholecystectomy attractive to the buyer. The most important question is, how much of a reduction in charge (cost) would be necessary to make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective? This depends not only on a reduction in charges but on the percentage of conversions (because of the high cost of conversions). Sensitivity analysis of these data shows that if the conversion rate equals 5%, a charge of $12,679.90 would be needed to make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective (figure 2). Therefore, a $3,331 reduction in the charge of laparoscopic cholecystectomy would be needed before all patients could be considered for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, a $4,689 reduction would be needed to consider all patients for laparoscopic cholecystectomy",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40, 'symbol': '•'}"

The study included 242 children aged 0.9 to 16.4 years, followed up from diagnosis to adulthood.

The study also found that pr duration was shorter in patients with 2 positive autoantibodies compared to patients with a single autoantibody. The results suggest that pr duration is associated with lower a1c levels and higher c-peptide levels, which may indicate a reduced rate of complications and severe hypoglycemia. However, the study did not observe long-term effects of pr on diabetes complications or incidence of severe hypoglycemia, partly due to low numbers of events.

691,"<summary>Sch (subclinical hypothyroidism) is a condition characterized by an elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, often with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level. It is a relatively common disorder, with the majority of experts agreeing that it represents early, mild thyroid failure. The prevalence of sch varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement. The optimal TSH cutoff values and clinical significance of these subclinical abnormalities are even more controversial. The treatment of sch is considered only for patients who are pregnant, infertile, exhibit associated symptoms, or have a high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism. The prevalence of sch is relatively high and ranges from 4% to 20% in the adult population. The adverse clinical effects associated with overt thyroid disorders are well known and given the multiple actions of thyroid hormones on the heart, vessels, bones, and brain, long-term adverse outcomes may manifest as subclinical levels of dysfunction. Studies have shown that sch can lead to impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function, symptomatic sch patients often complain of reduced exercise tolerance during effort, and older people with sch and a high cv risk appear to be at an increased risk of incident heart failure. The negative effects of sch on cv function might be improved or reversed by replacement doses of t4. The indications for the screening of sch and the determination of tsh threshold levels for the treatment of sch have remained a clinical controversy for over many years. The present review has highlighted the fact that sch is associated with an increased risk of developing a wide range of adverse health outcomes and that sch might represent a potentially modifiable risk factor of cvd and mortality. Therefore, understanding the prevalence and risk factors of sch could aid in the prevention of cvd in this population.</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 2, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '*'}"

* Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of ifg, igt, or both ifg and igt based on a screening 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) (17).
* Participants were randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two-by-two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization.
* Participants were assessed at regular intervals to ascertain the occurrence of the primary outcome, which included new-onset diabetes or all-cause mortality.
* The primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow-up.
* -cell function was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
* Both indexes have previously been validated against gold-standard measures of insulin secretion (18,19) and have been shown to be significant predictors of incident diabetes in large epidemiological studies.
* The IGI was divided by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) to account for compensatory insulin secretion responses.
* The PI was divided by c-peptide concentration to account for compensatory insulin secretion responses.
* The analysis included longitudinal analyses of associations between treatments and changes in -cell function measures.
* The results suggest that ramipril does not have significant effects on -cell function compared with placebo in people at high risk for diabetes, and thus its glucose-lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms.
* The improvement in -cell function in the placebo arm of the ramipril marginal group analysis may be explained by the fact that half of the participants on ramipril placebo were receiving active rosiglitazone, which may reduce insulin resistance and improve -cell function indirectly.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 14, 'symbol': '*'}"

• Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths and its incidence is still increasing.
• Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
• The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufas) were proved in several observational and experimental studies.
• The lipid lowering action of n-3 pufas was detected at the beginning, so these nutrients were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.
• Their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were observed later.
• Low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
• The induction of inflammation may well provide a link between hyperlipidemia and atherogenesis [2,3].
• Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease featuring low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through disease progression.
• In physiological conditions, endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide (no) and prostaglandins (such as pge2 and pge3) and maintain a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules.
• However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts leading towards an increase production of proinflammatory cytokines as interleukins 1, 2, and 6 (il-1, 2, and 6) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf-), with further progression of the disease.
• These pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) by monocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes.
• Pufas and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role modulating the inflammatory response (figure 1).
• Unsaturated fatty acids are referred to as pufas when two or more double bonds are present.
• There are two pufas families, omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids.

1. Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, with 25% of all pregnancies being affected.
2. Proteinuria is a common symptom in women with PE, but its clinical diagnosis is not standardized.
3. The incidence of PE increased in China, as the two-child policy was opened, but there was no indicator of severe PE.
4. Hypoalbuminemia is a significant indicator of PE severity, as it leads to large protein leakage and intravascular dehydration.
5. Hypoalbuminemia is mainly due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged vascular endothelial cells, causing large protein and liquid leakage in tissue clearance and loss of plasma proteins.
6. Hypoalbuminemia accelerates intravascular dehydration, leading to intravascular lesions, which may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet (HELLP) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
7. The reduction of hepatic blood flow due to the production of albumin is decreased, leading to a decrease in albumin levels.
8. The trial management team reviewed the case and made a diagnosis by two senior deputy chief physicians or chief physicians, acting independently, in the case of severe PE.
9. The study evaluated maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with PE according to the different values of albumin (25 g/L and < 25 g/L) and hypoalbuminemia.

Targeting Vegf-a Signaling: A 20-Year Review of Biochemical, Biologic, and Clinical Insights

• The past 20 years have provided a rich tapestry of agents that modify or inhibit the signaling pathways of Vegf-a, offering a diverse array of potential targets for anti-cancer therapy.

• Agents developed over the past 8 years have included a broad range of molecules targeting different components of the pathways, including Vegf-a itself, Vegf receptors, Vegf co-receptors, PTKs, and signaling intermediates. During this period, other Vegf family members have also been identified, enhancing the diversity of signaling induced by the Vegf family of ligands.

• The development of small-molecule PTK inhibitors of Vegf receptors (not highly specific) has been employed, although dose-limiting toxicity in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy has restricted their widespread use. Further insights into the structure and function of the PTK domains of Vegf receptors may allow the development of more specific small-molecule PTK inhibitors.

• Targeting the Vegf-a signaling pathway would likely have the merit of inhibiting both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, which could, in turn, restrict both solid tumor growth and metastatic spread.

• Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-angiogenic treatments could cause increased tumor metastasis through mechanisms such as the induction of hypoxia (due to Vegf-a inhibition), resulting in increased tumor cell motility.

• Other alternative molecular targets, such as c-met, may also be able to affect multiple tumor properties such as metastasis, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cellular motility upon hypoxia. Although not the subject of this review, such pathways may provide valid therapeutic targets for inhibiting angiogenesis and/or lymphangio-genesis in cancer, thereby restricting tumor growth and spread.

• Recent studies from our own laboratory have indicated the role of known inflammatory pathways in enhancing the spread of cancer, opening avenues for the use of existing anti-inflammatory drugs in cancer. This possibility is further exemplified by the recent studies published by Rothwell et al., demonstrating the anti-cancer effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin.

In the study, researchers investigated the effectiveness of three malaria diagnostic tests: microscopic, rdt, and nested-pcr. The study aimed to assess the concordance between routine malaria diagnostic techniques and nested-pcr for finding asymptomatic malaria cases in the elimination phase of malaria control. The results showed that nested-pcr was a sensitive and specific method to detect parasite genomes in asymptomatic samples, particularly in cases of asymptomatic and mixed infections. However, the performance of nested-pcr was limited by the difficulty in detecting lower than 100 p/l parasitemia, which may lead to reader variation in test results. Additionally, the short shelf life of nested-pcr emphasized the need for proficient transportation, storage, and distribution systems. The study highlighted the importance of using molecular methods in malaria control, including nested-pcr, to interrupt malaria transmission in Iran. It also emphasized the need to use all three types of malaria detection tools (microscopy, rdt, and nested-pcr) to improve sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for active case surveillance in endemic settings.

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterized by a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion.
• The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-ohd), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
• CAH is associated with different clinical forms, including classical CAH, the most severe form, and the non-classical (nc) form, which may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of postnatal or even adult onset hyperandrogenism.
• CAH constitutes an interesting natural model for studying interactions between hormones and the brain, as it involves both hormonal imbalances during early development and exposure to excess exogenous glucocorticoids.
• The study investigated the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in patients with CAH due to 21-ohd, including the under adequate hormonal control and chronically non-compliant patients.
• The study found that CAH patients exhibit increased frequency of white matter abnormalities and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis, which may be related to hormonal imbalances during brain development and corticosteroid treatment.
• The study also revealed that chronic hyperandrogenism, a result of non-compliance with treatment, may be the main mechanism involved in the genesis of brain mri abnormalities in CAH patients.",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The human genome draft sequence, when publicly funded and corporate projects are carried out, promises significant biomedical advances this century. Biologists must become adept at navigating the vast genomic data landscape, which may seem devoid of features, but contains rich veins of knowledge that can be exploited. Surveying and signposting this apparently bland genomic landscape should guide investigators towards experiments that address specific hypotheses about gene function. If the genome is to offer its secrets to all scientific communities, its surveyors need to adopt universal vocabularies. Broadly speaking, there are two common ways of annotating genes: websites such as locuslink, genecards, eugenes, and ensembl integrate information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes. Thus, one may browse sequence information, for example, concerning single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), alongside descriptions of molecular and cellular function and information relevant to human disease. Annotation is essential, but it is currently restricted to the minority of human genes that have been characterized experimentally. A key to the databases mentioned in this article is the second type of annotation, which relies on predicted evolutionary relationships rather than empirical observations. All genes that are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor are defined as homologs: where additional copies have arisen by gene duplication within a single genome, they are defined as paralogs, whereas corresponding genes in different species are orthologs. Proteins that are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor are defined as homologs: where additional copies have arisen by gene duplication within a single genome, they are defined as paralogs, whereas corresponding genes in different species are orthologs. The importance of annotating the genomic landscape on the basis of homology is that protein homologs invariably have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions. Domain architectures of the lbc oncogene product and the experimentally uncharacterized protein kiaa1415 are predicted using smart. The predicted domains in kiaa1415 suggest that it facilitates guanine nucleotide exchange on rho-type small GTPases (it has rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, or rhogef, and pleckstrin homology or ph domains) , it is localized to the plasma membrane (ph domain) and it may interact with the carboxyl termini of transmembrane receptors or channels (it has pdz domains). The generalized functions of dep domains are not currently known.

720,"<summary>Summary of LGS Treatment: A Multidisciplinary Approach</summary>

LGS (Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome) is a rare, severe, and often fatal epilepsy that affects children. It is classified as a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome, characterized by tonic and atonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, and myoclonic seizures. The primary features of LGS include interictal awake EEG patterns consisting of slow spike wave discharges (less than 3 Hz) and paroxysms of low voltage fast activity at about 10 Hz during sleep. The prognosis of LGS is poor, with moderate to severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders, and cognitive impairment. The typical age of onset is between 2 and 5 years, and boys are affected more frequently than girls. The prognosis of LGS is poor, with moderate to severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders, and cognitive impairment. The treatment of LGS involves the use of anticonvulsants, including valproic acid, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, clobazam, and carbamazepine.

Our study explored the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of the Madrid region's Iberian wall lizard, P. hispanica. We found that males from the northern populations had a higher number of female scents, indicating a higher production of chemical signals. This suggests that males from these populations might have a higher efficiency in communication and could be more effective in attracting females. Additionally, we observed that females from the northern populations showed a higher interest in scents from their own populations, suggesting a preference for scents from their area. These results suggest that chemical signals could play a role in reproductive isolation and speciation processes, but further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Rubella, a viral infection, can be transmitted through the placenta and reach the fetus during pregnancy. The most common complication of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which affects approximately 110,000 infants annually in developing countries. Rubella vaccination is crucial for preventing CRS and its serious complications in mothers and their fetuses. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent CRS and its serious complications in mothers and their fetuses. Rubella vaccination has been successful in reducing measles and rubella outbreaks in Iran. The main goal of this survey was to evaluate and compare the susceptibility and resistance of kermanshahi girls at marriage before and after mass rubella vaccination. The results showed a significant increase in seropositivity and immunity against rubella in vaccinated girls compared to unvaccinated girls. The effectiveness of the ra 27/3 vaccine has been demonstrated by the elimination of rubella and crs from the western hemisphere and several european countries that have achieved and maintained high vaccination coverage with vaccines containing ra 27/3. Mass rubella vaccination in 5 to 25 years old Iranian population during 2003, and continued thereafter as mmr in national vaccination program, has significantly increased the anti-rubella antibodies and immunity in high-risk people, as premarriage kermanshahi girls, and compared to many of the results specified in local and international sources, due to the susceptibility of less than 1% of the kermanshahi girls at marriage, there is no more need to screen the vaccinated girls at marriage, which was emphasized in 1999; however, the screening studies is recommended every few years. As the dispersed studies associated with the rubella seroepidemiology in different locations of the country resulted in awareness of lack of immunity of about 20% of the most vulnerable society members, i.e. , the pregnant women, and after that the policy makers decided to announce the rubella vaccine as the compulsory state vaccines, it is proposed such studies to be made for the immunity status against tetanus, diphtheria, etc. Additionally, due to the fact that neither rubella infection nor vaccination result in life-long immunity, it is proposed that once each couple of years the studies associated with the rubella seroepidemiology to be performed in different regions of the country and if necessary, the vaccination of vulnerable society members be made, like in 200",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 20, 'symbol': '•'}"

Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) through single-electron reduction of molecular oxygen (O2), which then converts to superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Similar to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, oxidation of cysteine residues represents a reversible posttranslational protein modification that regulates signaling. Mitochondrial ROS generation is crucial for the propagation of cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs. The epidermis contains significantly higher levels of ROS than other stem cell populations, and increased ROS levels correlate with differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The results of our study suggest that mros generation is required for activation of notch and -catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth, and that mros acts as a pro-differentiation signal. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation remain poorly understood, and more studies are needed to determine how mitochondrial metabolism regulates differentiation. The interactions between cellular differentiation programs and cellular metabolism will be increasingly studied in years to come. The development of regenerative therapies depends on maximizing the renewal capacity of stem cells and promoting complete differentiation into desired cell types. Cellular metabolism represents an intriguing rheostat that may be used to modulate these ends. A further understanding of the mechanisms by which differentiation programs regulate metabolism will be useful in this regard. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism promotes keratinocyte differentiation by providing substrates for histone acetyltransferases and histone demethylases are also important. Histone methylation status is regulated by demethylases and demethylases are sensitive to cellular metabolic state. Cancer researchers are currently striving to identify cancer-specific metabolic signatures which can be therapeutically targeted.</summary>",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 8, 'symbol': '*'}"

• Maslow's hierarchy of needs, proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943, is a well-known theory that categorizes human needs into five levels: physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization. The most fundamental level of needs is physiological, which includes food, sex, and safety. Maslow proposed that if physiological needs are satisfied, the organism may become more focused on safety needs, which include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being. Safety needs are more fundamental than physiological needs, as they are more important for survival. Maslow also found that practically everything looks less important than safety, even when physiological needs are satisfied. Safety needs can block physiological needs, and the classical example of Miller's avoidance and approach experiments is used to illustrate this. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is also supported by research on emotions, which shows that safety needs are faster and more fundamental than hedonic needs. The amygdala is the neural basis for fear, and it is also recognized as the neural basis for stress-induced fear and anxiety. The ne / lc system is important for directing animal behavior to cope with dangerous environments, and it is the neural structure for safety needs. The neural basis for safety is the amygdala and lc / ne system, which can be regarded as a safety circuitry, with major behavior functions being fight or flight and fear and anger emotions. Fear and anger are two sides of one sword, as they act in different directions: fear is to throw away the stimulus and anger is to fight the stimulus away. The direction of behavior is determined by the stressful events, and the first safety check is to feel scared and blame the unexpected. Afterward, the individual will have a hedonic need to see if it fits their personal needs and get the happy or sad emotions. Finally, everything comes to an end, and people return to calmness or miss the lost things and worry for the uncertain bad things. The emotional rainbow (or emotion flow) includes fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and missing, which are the five fundamental needs of humans. The emotional rainbow is a metaphor for the emotional flow in everyday life, and the direction of behavior is determined by the stressful events, and the first safety check is to feel scared and blame the unexpected.

The study found that malaria continues to be a serious public health problem in South-East Asia, particularly in India. About 36% of the world's population (2020 million) lives in areas with malaria transmission, with India contributing 76% of malaria cases. The study indicates that 22% of India's population live in high transmission areas, 67% in low transmission areas, and 11% in malaria-free areas. The incidence of malaria in India accounted for 58% of cases in the South-East Asia region. The study found that 90% of deaths were recorded in rural areas, with 86% occurring at home without medical attention. The study also found that 97% of respondents correctly associated malaria with mosquito bite, and 71.6% preferred going to doctors for malaria treatment. The study found that 92.5% of respondents considered malaria to be a serious health problem, reflecting their attitude to the disease. The findings of the study could shape the future discourse of research on local approaches to prevention of endemic diseases in India. The study participants belong to a low incidence state, and therefore, have a lower exposure to cases of malaria. The study participants' attitude toward malaria was reflected when more than 90% labeled it as a serious health problem. The majority (70.9%) of respondents consulted a doctor in case of a child's fever, and only 18.2% reported using a home remedy. The results are in contrast to those reported by Eversole et al., where treatment involved traditional medicines more frequently. The reasons for better access to registered medical practitioners in the study area could be attributed to the better availability of health care in the study area. The study found that 70.9% of respondents named drugs used in malaria treatment, and the most obvious reason could be low literacy in this rural population. The study participants' motivation to seek care for a febrile child was the condition of the child in an overwhelming 91.8% of the study population. The majority of respondents in the current study had adequate knowledge about protective as well as preventive measures against malaria, which concur with those reported by Hlongwana et al. in the study conducted in South Africa.

• Recent advancements in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome, including the dynamic nature of chromatin and the regulation of gene expression and DNA replication.
• The genome is folded hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), with specific long-range looping interactions occurring.
• Each of these structures can be dynamically regulated during development and perturbations in these folding units are associated with multiple diseases and cancer.
• One interesting feature revealed by fine mapping of the genome folding is the tad structures, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size.
• Tads are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions.
• The replication timing, presence of different histone modifications, and expression of genes inside a tad are highly correlated.
• However, the underlying features that generate invariant tad boundaries remain unknown.
• In human cells, tad boundaries have been associated with the enrichment of ctcf, cohesin, dnase I hypersensitivity, and certain histone marks.
• In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of insulators (also known as architectural proteins) such as beaf32 and tfiiic is associated with the strength of tad boundaries.
• The boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, thus the most likely interaction partner for a genomic region is another region within the same tad.
• A strong tad boundary limits interactions between the two adjacent tad domains, whereas a weak tad boundary allows a higher frequency of inter-tad interactions.
• Although a relationship between tad boundaries and the binding of insulators has been demonstrated, the effects of enzymes that modify or remodel chromatin are largely unknown.
• The major atpase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, brg1 (also known as smarca4), is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions as well as for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions.
• The relationship between brg1 knockdown and reduced nucleosome occupancy around ctcf sites supports the idea that brg1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and prevent binding of transcription factors and/or chromatin modifiers at tad boundaries.

It highlights the challenges in studying the host response to Leishmania infection, including the difficulty in distinguishing between inflammatory and pathogen-specific responses.
• The study uses transcriptomic profiling to identify aberrant expression of the rxra transcriptional pathway in infected kcs, which is associated with the survival of amastigotes. The data suggest that this pathway is not regulated in infected cells but is activated in inflamed cells.
• The study demonstrates that aberrant expression of the rxra transcriptional pathway in infected kcs favors parasite survival and validates the use of cells exposed to inflammation as a means to discover pathogen-regulated transcriptomic pathways in vivo.
• The study also shows that uninfected kcs in the immediate vicinity of infected cells also respond to infection by loss of membrane activity, suggesting that these cells are responding to the inoculated parasites through rapid activation.
• The study provides insights into the transcriptomic response induced by L. donovani infection in vivo and demonstrates that the use of cells exposed to inflammation is a powerful method for the discovery of pathogen-regulated gene pathways.
• The study shows that uninfected kcs also undergo significant biological and gene transcriptional changes associated with the inoculation of live L. donovani amastigotes into mice, indicating that soluble mediators or signals operating in trans facilitate global activation of macrophages within the infected tissue.

• The control of appetite is a complex process involving inputs from both physiological and environmental sources.
• Early theoretical approaches focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue.
• More recent models emphasise inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, with hormonal signals from specialised cells in the gut or associated organs.
• The major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, pyy, glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1), cholecystokinin (cck), amylin, and insulin from specialised cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs.
• Such models account for the regulation of appetite and contribute to the regulation of body weight, through the identification of specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.
• Interest in this type of formulation has strengthened during the period when molecular biology began to take over from integrative physiology as an explanatory approach in biological sciences.
• The major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat, with intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition.
• An alternative to the molecular approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance, with the inter-relationships between ee and energy intake.
• Exercise has been shown to have a significant impact on appetite regulation, with acute bouts of exercise not leading to a consistent increase in average food intake or total daily ee.
• The relationship between exercise and appetite is complex, with ffm (fat free mass) and rmr (respiratory quotient) being the largest components of total daily ee.

In prosthetic dentistry, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is widely used as a denture base material due to its excellent esthetics, low water sorption, solubility, relative lack of toxicity, repair ability, and simple processing technique. However, the popularity and simplicity of the compression molding technique are often overshadowed by the high processing stresses induced during polymerization. Chemically activated resins, such as chemically activated resins, are less frequently used for denture base fabrication compared to heat-activated resins. These materials have higher solubility and inferior color stability due to oxidation of the amine accelerator. The injection molding technique has a reduced processing time, lower cost, lower skin sensitivity to evaporated monomer, and availability of the resin reservoir to compensate for acrylic resin shrinkage. The shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat- polymerized and autopolymerized PMMA resins was significantly affected by surface treatments, with monomer treatment significantly affecting bond strength. The results of this study suggest that surface treatments with monomer are effective for improving bond strength between denture teeth and denture base resins.

• Taxol can prevent cell death and inflammation in nephropathy. 
• Taurine reduces iron-potentiated alcoholic liver fibrosis by reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators, and stellate cell activation. 
• The results of the study by Zhou et al. indicate that 200 nmol/l paclitaxel ameliorates hepatic fibrosis by modulating transforming growth factor-beta signaling. 
• The protective effects of taurine in renal fibrosis can be considered responsible for the protective effects of taxol and taurine in the present study. 
• Taxol and taurine can both prevent some structural renal damage in the direct obstruction model in rats.

* Oral cancer is a significant public health problem in India, with chewing betel quid being considered a relatively innocuous practice.
* The association between betel quid chewing and oral cancer has been well-established for over a century, with tobacco being introduced by European settlers four centuries ago.
* In recent years, the causal association between betel quid chewing and oral cancer has become more evident, with tobacco being used with a culturally accepted betel quid substance.
* Tobacco is now considered a carcinogen, with areca nut being erroneously thought of as playing a more important role.
* Betel nut chewing is responsible for oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), an established precancerous condition with trismus.
* OSMF is a rare disease in the early 1980s, occurring generally among older age groups who chew betel quid frequently.
* The incidence of oral cancer has increased among young adults due to increased betel nut chewing, with gutkha chewing being the most common cause.
* The incidence of oral cancer in India is 12.5 per 100,000, with the largest numbers of oral cancer patients being present in India.
* The epidemic proportion of oral cancer in India is due to the widespread use of betel nut, betel quid, gutkha, and pan masala chewing, which are proven carcinogens.
* The study found that betel nut may be consumed alone or as a betel quid in combination with betel leaf and slaked lime and may contain other substances like tobacco, catechu, spices, or sweeteners.
* Betel leaf that is commonly consumed with this nut contains a known carcinogen named safrole.
* Betel leaf is the fourth most common addictive substance after tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine.
* Betel nut derived alkaloids are cholinergic agonists and affect nervous system via acetylcholine.
* Betel nut chewing is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, cancers of the larynx, stomach, lung, and cervix in humans.
* Betel nut is a synergistic carcinogen along with tobacco with which it is commonly consumed in India.
* Betel nut addiction has been linked to heart attacks, arrhythmia, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and other systemic diseases.
* Betel nut and betel quid chewing has become the top five oral habits in the world",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 27, 'symbol': '*'}"
767,"<summary>Source Document Summary: The concept of patient blood management is gaining increased attention. Recent studies have highlighted the need for reductions in blood and blood product transfusions due to increased morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Postoperative severe bleeding is a common complication following cardiac surgery, and patients with advanced age and long CPB are particularly at risk. The use of blood and blood products is still common in cardiac and vascular surgery, and guidelines recommend discontinuing aspirin two to ten days before elective cardiac surgery and withdrawing adp receptor antagonists at least five days before elective CABG. The use of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and oral adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists, is also recommended for patients with coronary artery disease. The use of antiplatelet agents at the time of CABG carries both benefits and risks, and the correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and haemoglobin can be visualized. The correlation between blood flow, oxygen delivery, and haemoglobin can be easily visualized, demonstrating that oxygen delivery is determined by only three variables: cardiac output (CO), haemoglobin (Hb), and oxygenation (SaO2). The correlation between actual RBC transfusion and residual euroscore (residual euroscore - age factor) indicates that patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are able to compensate with increased cardiac output in response to haemodilution if normovolaemia is maintained. The use of restrictive transfusion regimens, such as those for patients with coronary artery disease, may also be beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction and a low preoperative haemoglobin level.

1. Transposable elements (tes) have been considered as pure selfish and junk elements parasitic on genomes.
2. Retroelements use retrotransposition to insert new copies of themselves into genomes.
3. Retroviruses and ltr retrotransposons are distinguished by the presence or absence of an envelope gene, which encodes a protein necessary for virus entry into the target cell.
4. The second large category of tes, dna transposons, excise from their original insertion site and reintegrate into a new location.
5. Most dna transposons are cut and pasted, catalyzed by an enzyme called transposase, and have properties that can be of interest for host cellular pathways.
6. The molecular domestication of te-encoded proteins has been proposed to be derived from a defence mechanism repressing the activity of the ancestral retrotransposon before domestication.
7. Some te-encoded genes, such as gin1 and gin2, have been found in vertebrates and other organisms, indicating that molecular domestication events have occurred before the divergence between tetrapods and bony fish.
8. The formation of gin2, a zinc finger domain protein, suggests that it was formed through two independent molecular domestication events, one at the base of amniota and the other in a more ancient vertebrate ancestor.
9. The presence of gin2 in vertebrates suggests that it was formed before the divergence between cartilaginous and ray-finned fish about 500 million years ago.
10. The analysis of new vertebrate genomes, particularly teleostean and cartilaginous fishes, will help better understand the distribution and evolutionary history of gin genes.",0,"{'n_points': 3, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 12, 'symbol': '*'}"

Progressive and devastating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. These diseases are caused by misfolding of proteins, which can amplify by recruiting soluble forms of homologous proteins. Misfolded proteins can propagate from one cell to another, leading to the formation of self-sustaining, exponential vicious circles. These circular aggregates can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function. The aggregation of fibrillar proteins, such as tau, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and CJD. The aggregation of prion proteins, such as prp, can spread in a prion-like manner. The aggregation of non-mutant prp can lead to distinct diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob and new variant CJD. The aggregation of tau can lead to distinct tauopathies like argyrophilic grain disease, tangle-only dementia, pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and cortico-basal degeneration.

2. Methadone exposure has been linked to cognitive impairments, including impaired psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem-solving, memory, decision-making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition.
3. Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration (ca) are involved in controlling cellular processes such as neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription.
4. However, the physiological ca signal can switch to a death signal when ca levels increase dramatically.
5. Mitochondrial ca overload can contribute to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp) formation and ultimately lead to cell death.

In the past fifty years, medical knowledge has expanded rapidly, and the number of scientific papers published has doubled over 10 years. Studies indicate that 5 questions per hospitalized patient and 2 questions per outpatient patient are raised for physicians. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a new paradigm that attempts to direct clinical services and care toward effective, efficient services with minimal complications and errors. EBM is influential in filling the knowledge gap in helping physicians find the best evidence for patients care. It is a systematic approach for solving clinical problems that allows integration of available best evidence with clinical experience and preferences and values of patients. The main challenge today is transferring and translating knowledge that helps physicians make the best clinical decisions based on the best evidence in the minimum time. Evidence-based medicine is a solution for the lack of update information for physicians. The main role and importance of EBM in health care system are to ensure the best quality health care and service for the people. Clinical effectiveness is one of the main goals of health care system, and it requires reference to the best local evidence in different parts of the health care. The system that provides reference to the best local evidence and guarantees evidence-based decision making (EBDM) is called evidence-based health care system (EBHC). The system is composed of various components, including evidence-based practices, knowledge products, and performance monitoring. The system ensures that the best evidence are produced, stored, disseminated, used, and shared for providing effective and safe services through a systematic process according to needs of different stakeholders.

* Several community-based studies have shown a strong correlation among sexual dysfunction, increasing age, and the severity of luts.
* The coexistence of sexual problems with luts and benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) further affects quality of life (qol).
* The continuous efforts have been made to disclose the common pathophysiology between luts and ed.
* No definite explanations have been given to clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of the correlation between luts and ed.
* Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the correlation between luts and ed.
* One possible cause is overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
* According to this hypothesis, luts increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which induces the occurrence of urinary storage symptoms due to the contraction of smooth muscles in the prostate gland and urinary bladder.
* Ed occurs as the result of smooth muscle contractions in the corpus spongiosum, and the myosin light chain is phosphorylated because of increased rho - kinase activity, which can cause smooth muscle layer contraction.
* It has been proposed that endothelial dysfunction in the prostate gland and corpus spongiosum and hormonal imbalance are physiological causes for the correlation between luts and erectile dysfunction.
* Changes in lifestyle due to nocturia and rapid eye movement sleep disorder may affect the occurrence of erectile dysfunction.
* The result of our preliminary study showed that age, international prostate symptom score (ipss), nocturia, and the uroflow rate correlated significantly with the 5-item version of the international index of erectile function (iief-5).
* The primary treatment regimen for bph is to administer alpha - blockers, which are based on smooth muscle relaxation in the prostate and the resulting improvement in the urinary flow rate and voiding symptoms.
* However, a synchronous improvement of irritative and voiding symptoms may be the most effective treatment regimen for luts / bph.
* These effects are expected to have a positive effect in secondarily improving sexual function.
* Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the effects on erectile function of a combination of the alpha - blocker tamsulosin to improve luts and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin to improve irritative symptoms of the bladder.

* The aim of this cadaveric study was to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach.
* Care was taken to have a flat positioning of both tape ends at the end of the procedures.

In the source document, the team discussed the design of a remote control for televisions. They identified several features that were currently present on existing remote controls, such as buttons and channels. However, they also noted that there were too many buttons on the remote control, which made it difficult to use. The team decided to focus on the functionality of the remote control, such as the ability to turn on and off the TV, change channels, and control volume.
