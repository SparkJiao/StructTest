1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well-understood.
2. Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions and system parameters, leading to complex phase-space structures and changes in transport properties.
3. A previous conjecture by Mateos that current reversal is correlated with a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior was challenged by Barbi and Salerno, who argued that current reversal can occur without such bifurcations.
4. The authors investigate the ensemble dependence of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet and find that the current can depend significantly on the details of the initial ensemble.
5. The authors find that while not all bifurcations lead to current reversal, most current reversals are associated with bifurcations.
6. The authors propose a generalized rule that bifurcations correspond to sudden changes (spikes or jumps) in the current, which may or may not lead to current reversal.
7. The authors acknowledge that there are cases where the proposed heuristics do not apply, and further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for when the rules are valid or violated.
8. The authors emphasize the importance of considering ensemble characteristics, especially near bifurcation points, when studying the transport properties of chaotic systems.

1. The source document discusses the wide range of eccentricities observed in extrasolar planets, which has led to several theories about their origin, such as planet-planet scattering and interactions with stellar companions.
2. The authors have undertaken an intensive survey of selected single-planet systems to search for additional low-mass companions, using high-precision radial velocity data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET).
3. The authors performed test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems and found that there are regions where additional objects can exist.
4. The authors combined the results of the dynamical simulations with detection limits computed using the HET data and found that they could rule out additional short-period planets down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions of some systems.
5. The authors found no evidence for additional planets in the six systems studied, but the results highlight the importance of combining observational limits with dynamical constraints to understand the architecture of extrasolar planetary systems.

1. The LEP experiments at the Z-boson resonance have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z-decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousands.
2. The good agreement of the LEP data with the SM predictions have severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the Z-pole.
3. The physics of the Z-boson will again play a central role in particle physics if the next generation Z factory comes true with the generated Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.
4. The authors study the rare Z-decays Z → h1 h2, Z → h1 γ, and Z → h1 h1 in the Type-II 2HDM, Lepton-Specific 2HDM, NMSSM, and nMSSM, which predict a light CP-odd Higgs boson h1.
5. The authors perform scans over the parameter space of these models, taking into account various experimental constraints, and find that the branching ratios of these rare Z-decays can reach up to 10^-5, 10^-4, and 10^-3, respectively, which may be accessible at the GigaZ option.
6. The authors find that the decay Z → h1 h1 may serve as an alternative channel to distinguish the NMSSM from the nMSSM if the supersymmetry is found at the LHC and the Z → h1 h1 is observed at the GigaZ with a large rate.
7. In the NMSSM, the authors find that the h1 can be lighter than 10 GeV without conflicting with low energy data, and the largest branching ratio among the studied rare Z-decays is for Z → h1 a, where a is a light pseudoscalar.
8. The authors conclude that the rare Z-decays can be used to distinguish different models through the measurement of these rare decays at the GigaZ option.
9. The work was supported by various grants and projects.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale.
2. The no-scale type Kähler potential, where the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, is a highly predictive scenario with a few parameters and suppressed flavor-changing neutral currents.
3. The minimal no-scale scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale is severely constrained by the current Higgs mass bound and the B → Xsγ constraint, leaving a very narrow allowed region.
4. In the case where the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, a wider region of the parameter space is allowed, and the Tevatron Run 2 may have a chance to observe SUSY signatures like trilepton events.
5. In the case of non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, the Higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino-like neutralino LSP case, requiring the LSP mass to be larger than about 245 GeV and 370 GeV for positive and negative μ, respectively.
6. In the wino-like neutralino LSP and sneutrino LSP cases, the LSP mass can be as small as 150 GeV, but the mass difference between the LSP and parent particles produced at the collider is much smaller than in the minimal case, requiring unusual acceptance cuts.

1. The paper discusses the stability of Cauchy horizons (CH) and quasiregular (QR) singularities in the collision of cross-polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves.
2. The Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos (CX) solution and the Bell-Szekeres (BS) solution are introduced, both of which exhibit CH in the interaction region.
3. The stability of CH is investigated by adding test fields, such as EM, scalar, and null dust, to the background spacetime.
4. The Helliwell-Konkowski (HK) stability conjecture is used to predict the nature of the singularities formed in the presence of the test fields.
5. An exact back-reaction solution is presented, which represents the collision of cross-polarized EM field coupled with a scalar field.
6. The exact back-reaction solution shows that the QR singularities in the incoming region of the cross-polarized BS (CPBS) spacetime are unstable and transform into scalar curvature singularities, in agreement with the HK conjecture.
7. The addition of null dust shells to the CPBS spacetime also leads to the formation of a singular back-reaction solution, as predicted by the HK conjecture.
8. The paper concludes that the HK conjecture correctly predicts the instability of the CH and QR singularities in the CPBS spacetime, but it fails to accurately describe the nature of the singularities in the interaction region.

1. The study examines the X-ray properties of normal galaxies at cosmologically interesting distances using the Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) survey data.
2. The study finds that normal galaxies contribute up to 10% of the X-ray background flux in the 0.5-2 keV band and that the average X-ray luminosity of galaxies has increased by a factor of up to 2.5 from the local universe to a redshift of z~1.5.
3. The study places constraints on the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity of normal spiral galaxies up to z~1.5, which is an indicator of the current level of star formation in a galaxy.
4. The study suggests that many of the normal galaxies studied should be detectable with future, deeper Chandra observations, and that they account for a significant fraction of the soft X-ray background.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, which can be classified into three types: non-separability, EPR-steerability, and Bell-nonlocality.
2. EPR-steerability is the ability of one party (Alice) to steer the state of the other party (Bob) by performing measurements on her system, even if Bob's system cannot be trusted.
3. The authors investigate the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed reduced states, known as T-states, using the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism.
4. The authors construct a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for a family of T-states, which they conjecture is optimal and completely characterizes the non-steerable T-states.
5. The authors derive two sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability of T-states, one based on a new asymmetric steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix and the other on a known nonlinear steering inequality.
6. The authors find a remarkable connection between the LHS model and the properties of the quantum steering ellipsoid, which allows them to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability of T-states.
7. The authors discuss the potential extension of their work to arbitrary two-qubit states and the generalization to positive operator-valued measure (POVM) measurements.

1. The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively.
2. Encoding information in spin may have certain advantages, such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and potentially faster operation.
3. In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field was proposed.
4. The proposed spintronic logic gates have a severe shortcoming that precludes their use in pipelined architectures, as the exchange interaction is bidirectional, which cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals.
5. To address this issue, a solution involving a three-phase clocking system was proposed, but it is not an attractive solution due to the fabrication challenges and energy dissipation.
6. The obvious way to overcome the power dissipation challenge is to develop reversible logic gates that are not constrained by the Landauer limit.
7. In 1996, a logically and physically reversible quantum inverter using two exchange-coupled spins was devised, which can be viewed as a single-spin parametron and a qubit.
8. The motivation for using spin to encode qubits is the realization that spin coherence times in solids are much larger than charge coherence times.
9. Optical read-out of qubits appears to be a more practical approach compared to electrical read-out, as it does not require making contacts to individual quantum dots.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary that transfers mass to the white dwarf.
2. The observed orbital period distribution of CVs shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes, which current theoretical models have been unable to reproduce.
3. The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum and ""hide"" the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the minimum period (the period spike) by considering the effects of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) and the tidal deformation of the secondary star.
4. The authors find that even a maximally efficient CAML mechanism cannot increase the period minimum sufficiently, and an implausibly large deformation factor of around 1.18 is needed to obtain the observed minimum period of 78 minutes.
5. The authors employ a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the observed CV period distribution with various theoretically synthesized model distributions, and find that none of the models fit as well as a distribution that is simply flat in orbital period.
6. The authors suggest that most CVs must have formed at long periods and evolved through the period gap to become short-period CVs, consistent with independent evidence that CV secondary stars are somewhat evolved.

1. The mid-infrared spectral mapping of Stephan's Quintet using the Spitzer Space Telescope reveals powerful H2 emission that represents only a small fraction of the group-wide warm H2, which dominates the mid-infrared emission of the system.
2. The global L(H2)/L_X ratio in the main shock is >3, and 2.5 in the new ""bridge"" feature, confirming that mid-infrared H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures.
3. The infrared ionic line ratios imply that both silicon and iron are depleted onto dust, suggesting that dust is not destroyed in the shock.
4. Star formation in Stephan's Quintet is dominated by two regions at the extreme ends of the shock ridge, while regions dominated by warm H2 emission exhibit very low star formation rates.
5. The observed coexistence of [SIII] and H2 emission produced by ~200 km/s and ~20 km/s velocity shocks, respectively, is consistent with a model of a multiphase post-shock medium produced by a galaxy-wide collision.

1. The short-lived radioisotope 26Al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, the Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in primitive chondritic meteorites.
2. The initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity of 26Al and oxygen isotopes in the solar nebula can be reduced by a phase of marginal gravitational instability (MGU) in the disk, which leads to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and small particles.
3. MGU disks can also explain the high mass accretion rates needed to produce FU Orionis outbursts and offer an alternative mechanism for gas giant planet formation.
4. The models presented examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula, by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection process, for a variety of disk and central protostar masses, including protostars with M dwarf masses.
5. The models show that the initially highly heterogeneous disk becomes rapidly homogenized, with the dispersion decreasing to about 1-2% in the outer disk, regardless of the initial degree of instability or the injection location.
6. The models with M dwarf protostars show a longer timescale for homogenization, but the same qualitative behavior as the models with G dwarf protostars.
7. Continuous injection of isotopic heterogeneity at the outer disk surface, simulating ongoing UV photolysis and fractionation, can maintain higher levels of dispersion throughout the disk compared to single-shot injection.
8. The results suggest that MGU disk phases are likely to have occurred in the solar nebula and may also occur in low-mass M dwarf disks, with possible implications for the habitability of any resulting planetary systems.
9. The models demonstrate a robust result that MGU disk phases can drive rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains, as required to explain various observations in protoplanetary disks.

2. The dijet mass distribution was analyzed using data from Run 1a and Run 1b of the Tevatron, with upward fluctuations observed near 200 GeV/c^2, 550 GeV/c^2, and 850 GeV/c^2.
3. The authors performed a binned maximum likelihood fit to the data to search for narrow resonances, but concluded that the fluctuations were not statistically significant.
4. The authors set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross sections for various new particles, including axigluons, excited quarks, technirhos, W', Z', and E6 diquarks.
5. In the b-tagged dijet channel, the authors observed an upward fluctuation near 600 GeV/c^2 and set limits on the production of topgluons.
6. In the tt̄ channel, the authors observed a small shoulder of 6 events on a background of 12 in the region of 600 GeV/c^2, which is in an interesting mass region given the dijet and b-tagged dijet search results, but is not statistically significant.
7. The authors emphasize that the upward fluctuations observed in all three channels (dijet, b-tagged dijet, and tt̄) may be the first signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model, and that the remaining integrated luminosity from Run 1b has the potential to either kill the fluctuations or reveal the most interesting new physics in a generation.

2. Broad emission lines like Hα are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk that fuels the central supermassive black hole.
3. Two populations of type 1 AGN have been identified based on the width of the broad Hα line: population A with narrower lines (FWHM Hα = 1000-4000 km/s) and population B with broader lines (FWHM Hα = 4000-12000 km/s).
4. Broad FeII emission is almost ubiquitous in type 1 quasars, and its width appears to correlate with the width of Hα.
5. The authors find no evidence for a systematic redshift of FeII relative to Hα or [OIII] in their sample of bright SDSS quasars, contrary to a previous claim.
6. The authors argue that the claimed FeII redshifts are likely due to low signal-to-noise data and the presence of strong HeII emission, which was not accounted for in the previous study.

3. The improved model is used to reevaluate the caloric curves, heat capacities, and the HELI isotopic temperature curve, and the results are compared with experimental data.
4. The model is able to simultaneously reproduce the ""definitory"" characteristics of nuclear multifragmentation, such as the multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments and the charge asymmetry of the two largest fragments.
5. The model identifies a non-equilibrium part in the experimentally evaluated excitation energies, which grows with increasing bombarding energy, and suggests that this is due to pre-equilibrium and pre-breakup stages.

There is an ongoing debate on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events (nanoflares). Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations in the corona have been made to investigate the role of MHD waves in coronal heating.

2. The 22 GHz masing transition of H2O has been used to trace high-excitation gas around star-forming regions and evolved stars, but it provides no information on the role of H2O at large spatial scales.
3. Other H2O lines have been detected from ground or airborne-based telescopes, and the 183 GHz transition has been used to map the emission of H2O at very large spatial scales.
4. The ISO satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, but the observations have drawbacks due to limited spectral resolution, high opacity, and poor angular resolution.
5. The 325 GHz line of H2O was observed in the direction of Orion IRC2 and other molecular clouds, but no maps were obtained.
6. The observations reported in this study show the detection of extended water emission at 325 GHz and indicate that the H2O abundance is around 10^-5 in the ""plateau"" region of the Orion molecular cloud.
7. The ground-based observations provide much finer spatial resolution than ISO or SWAS and an estimate of the H2O abundance as accurate as that obtained from the extremely optically thick H2O lines observed in the submillimeter and far-infrared domains.

2. Entanglement can exhibit rich dynamical behaviors, such as entanglement sudden death (ESD) and revival, under the influence of decoherence.
3. Recent studies have shown that the lost entanglement of qubits is transferred to the reservoirs, and ESD of qubits is accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of reservoirs.
4. The authors investigate the entanglement dynamics in a system of two qubits interacting with two independent amplitude-damping reservoirs, using an exact non-Markovian approach.
5. They find that an identity relating the entanglement in all bipartite subsystems is satisfied at any time, regardless of the details of the reservoirs and their coupling to the qubits.
6. The distribution of entanglement among the bipartite subsystems depends on the properties of the reservoir, particularly the formation of bound states between the qubits and the reservoirs.
7. In the presence of bound states, the entanglement can be stably distributed among all the bipartite subsystems, in contrast to the Markovian approximation or the decoherence-free double Jaynes-Cummings model.
8. ESD of the qubits is not always accompanied by ESB of the reservoirs, and the identity about the entanglement distribution is still valid in the presence of decoherence.
9. The stable entanglement distribution resulting from the bound states is a general phenomenon in open quantum systems when the non-Markovian effect is taken into account.

4. The recombination of shower partons with thermal partons in heavy-ion collisions is shown to be more important than fragmentation in the intermediate transverse momentum region.
5. The two-pion distribution in a jet cannot be adequately represented by the fragmentation functions alone, and the shower parton distributions are necessary to capture the correlations.

2. Discretizing the Dirac-Khler formulation to regularize calculations has been challenging, especially in defining the Hodge star and wedge product.
3. Several discrete schemes have been proposed to address these difficulties, including the use of lattices and quantized phase spaces.
4. The two-lattice proposal by Adams maintains the locality of the Hodge star and captures the properties of the wedge product, providing a local, discrete differential geometry.
5. The staggered fermion formulation in lattice QCD is related to the continuum Dirac-Khler formulation, and a discrete Dirac-Khler formulation can offer insights into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories.
6. The authors show how the two-lattice proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the Dirac-Khler formulation and extend the idea to describe exact flavor projection, requiring the introduction of two new complexes and a new operator.
7. To implement simultaneous chiral and flavor projection, the authors introduce a duplicate set of complexes and carefully define the projections to isolate a single flavor of chiral field on each complex.
8. The path integral evaluation on the individual complexes, prior to flavor projection, is equivalent to the quarter-root trick used in lattice QCD.
9. Applying both chiral and flavor projection changes the relationship between the fields and the path integral, resulting in a product of four right-handed and four left-handed single-flavor path integrals.
10. The authors have demonstrated the ability to describe exact chiral symmetry and exact flavor projection for Dirac-Khler fermions using the geometric discretization approach.

1. The paper investigates collaborative relay beamforming in cognitive radio networks under secrecy constraints, where the goal is to maximize the secrecy rate while keeping the interference on the primary user below a certain limit and keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the transmitted information.

2. The authors formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a quasiconvex optimization problem that can be solved using semidefinite programming. They also propose two suboptimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce the computational complexity.

3. The numerical results show that the suboptimal null space beamforming schemes achieve performance close to the optimal solution, especially in the high SNR regime, suggesting that null space beamforming is a good alternative with much less computational burden.

4. The authors also investigate the impact of individual power constraints on the secrecy rates and observe that they lead to only small losses compared to the total power constraint case.

1. The paper discusses the benefits of maintaining the Weyl (conformal) invariance when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS).
2. The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism to realize all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space, and introduce auxiliary fields to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field.
3. The authors derive the Wightman two-point functions for the Maxwell and auxiliary fields in CFS, and show that they can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts through an ""extended Weyl transformation"".
4. The authors apply the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to ensure the Maxwell equation and the Eastwood-Singer gauge condition hold in the mean on the space of physical states.
5. The authors provide explicit expressions for the Wightman two-point functions in the particular case of de Sitter space, and show that the two-point function for the Maxwell field has the same physical content as the one derived by Allen and Jacobson.
6. The authors conclude that maintaining the Weyl invariance during the whole quantization process is beneficial when dealing with the Maxwell field in CFS, as it allows to simplify the calculations by relating the problem to the Minkowskian case.

2. GRB 090510 is identified as a prototype of a new class of short gamma-ray bursts (S-GRBs) that are associated with the formation of a black hole.
3. The analysis reveals a precise sequence of events in GRB 090510, including a thermal emission from the P-GRB (prompt gamma-ray burst), the onset of the GeV emission linked to the black hole formation, and the structure of the circumburst medium derived from the prompt emission.

1. The paper discusses the renormalization of theories with physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), focusing on the SM augmented by a real scalar triplet (Triplet Model) and the minimal Left-Right (LR) symmetric model.

2. In these models, the dependence of the W-boson mass on the top quark mass becomes logarithmic, unlike the quadratic dependence in the SM. This is due to the presence of additional parameters in the gauge/Higgs sector, requiring a fourth input parameter for a consistent renormalization scheme.

3. The scalar contributions to the W-boson mass in the Triplet Model can be large and depend quadratically on the scalar masses, unlike the SM where the scalar contributions are logarithmic due to the custodial symmetry.

4. The Triplet Model and the LR model do not recover the SM result even when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale, due to the non-decoupling nature of the additional scalar fields.

5. In the Triplet Model, a heavy neutral Higgs boson (up to a TeV) can be consistent with the precision electroweak data due to cancellations between the contributions of the lightest neutral Higgs and the additional scalar fields.

6. The results demonstrate the importance of performing the renormalization correctly according to the electroweak structure of the new models, as the one-loop electroweak results cannot be split into an SM contribution plus a piece that vanishes as the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the weak scale.

1. A choice of nonconstant meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface realizes the surface as a finite-sheeted branched covering of the Riemann sphere.
2. Log-Riemann surfaces of finite type are certain branched coverings of the Riemann sphere by a punctured compact Riemann surface, given by certain transcendental functions of infinite degree.
3. Log-Riemann surfaces of finite type have finitely many ramification points and finitely generated fundamental group, and are given by a pair of a compact Riemann surface and a meromorphic function on the punctured surface with exponential singularities at the punctures.
4. Exp-algebraic curves are a less rigid structure than log-Riemann surfaces, consisting of a compact Riemann surface and equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions with exponential singularities at the punctures.
5. For an exp-algebraic curve, a degree zero line bundle and a meromorphic connection can be naturally associated, and these determine the exp-algebraic curve.
6. The spaces of functions and differential forms with exponential singularities on an exp-algebraic curve are isomorphic to the spaces of meromorphic sections and forms on the associated line bundle.
7. A Torelli-type theorem is proved, stating that two exp-algebraic curves with the same underlying Riemann surface, the same set of punctures, and isomorphic line bundles with compatible connections are equivalent.
8. Functions and differentials with exponential singularities have appeared in the literature, particularly in the context of integrable systems and the Weierstrass problem.

1. The study of harmonic maps was initiated by F.B. Fuller, J. Nash, and J.H. Sampson, and the first general result on the existence of harmonic maps is due to Eells-Sampson.
2. Harmonic maps are extrema (critical points) of the energy functional defined on the space of smooth maps between Riemannian (pseudo-Riemannian) manifolds, and the trace of the second fundamental form of such maps vanishes.
3. The tension field of a map is defined, and a map is said to be harmonic if its tension field vanishes identically.
4. The index of a harmonic map is defined as the dimension of the tangent subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite, and a harmonic map is said to be stable if its Morse index is zero.

1. The study analyzed the far-infrared (FIR) properties of a large sample of 313 active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from the Swift/BAT 58-month catalog. The authors used Herschel/SPIRE observations to obtain photometry at 250, 350, and 500 μm, which, combined with previous Herschel/PACS data, provided the complete FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the AGN sample.

2. The authors found that the FIR properties of the AGN sample, such as luminosities and colors, are generally similar to those of normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting that the FIR emission is primarily due to dust heated by stellar radiation rather than the AGN. However, a small subset of AGN showed anomalous FIR colors, which the authors attribute to synchrotron emission from radio jets associated with the AGN.

3. The authors also investigated the relationship between the FIR luminosities and the AGN X-ray luminosity, a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity. While they found a weak correlation between the FIR and X-ray luminosities for type 1 AGN, the correlation was absent for type 2 AGN, suggesting that the AGN contribution to the FIR emission is generally small, except for the most luminous AGN.

The paper investigates the generation of non-zero Dirac CP violation in a softly broken A4 symmetric model through the incorporation of a single parameter perturbation in the Dirac neutrino mass matrix. The authors study all possible nine cases of breaking the A4 symmetry and find that breaking at the 12 and 13 elements of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix are the most feasible in view of the recent neutrino experimental results.

2. The authors extend their analysis by considering one of the parameters as complex and find that the model can generate a large Dirac CP violating phase and a small but non-zero reactor mixing angle, which are consistent with the current experimental data. They also study the implications of the model for leptogenesis and show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated within the same parameter space as the low-energy neutrino data.

3. The authors find that the phases responsible for leptogenesis are correlated with the low-energy CP violating phases in the model, and they establish various relations among the different phases. They conclude that the A4 symmetry is an approximate symmetry, and the small breaking parameter is sufficient to describe the low-energy neutrino data and high-energy CP violation.

2. They find that the total normal CCF acting on one of the colloids can change sign as the distance between the colloid and the substrate is varied, indicating the possibility of an unstable mechanical equilibrium configuration.
3. The presence of the substrate lifts the degeneracy between the CCFs for colloids with different boundary conditions (BCs) at the critical composition of the solvent.
4. The lateral CCF between colloids with opposite BCs can become attractive for large lateral distances, which is a pure many-body effect.
5. The authors determine the pure many-body contribution to the CCFs and find that it can change sign at fixed temperature upon varying the lateral position of the colloid.
6. The many-body contribution to the normal CCF is found to be more long-ranged compared to the corresponding contribution to the van der Waals force between two atoms close to a surface.
7. For vertically aligned colloids, the many-body contribution to the normal CCF is directed towards the substrate if the colloids have the same BCs, and away from the substrate if the colloids have opposite BCs.
8. The contribution of the many-body CCFs to the total force is significant when the colloid-colloid and colloid-substrate distances are small, as well as when the binary liquid mixture is close to its critical point.

4. The authors conducted experiments to study the hydrogenation of coronene cations in the gas phase, using mass spectrometry to determine the degree of hydrogenation.
5. The results show that odd hydrogenation states of coronene cations predominantly populate the mass spectrum, indicating the presence of a barrier for the further hydrogenation of odd hydrogenation states.

1. The paper investigates the zero-field Hall effect in chiral d-wave superconductors, which arises from the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition. The authors show that the Hall conductivity can be nonzero due to the asymmetric angular response of the vortex-antivortex pairs to the driving field, which is a consequence of the broken time-reversal symmetry in chiral d-wave superconductors.

2. The authors derive the length-dependent response functions that describe the longitudinal and transverse polarization of the vortex-antivortex pairs under an external perturbation. These response functions exhibit a dip-recouping shape, which plays a crucial role in determining the features of the Hall conductivity, such as the sign reversal and strong positive peaks.

3. The authors also consider the contribution from the free vortex motion and discuss the total conductivity tensor, which includes both the bound pair and free vortex contributions. They show that the Hall conductivity and power dissipation can diverge in the static limit in the low-temperature phase, but remain finite in the high-temperature phase due to the dominance of the free vortex contribution.

3. The present study revisits the question of the existence of H3^2+ using two methods: a specialized variational approach with physically relevant trial functions and a standard variational approach using Gaussian basis functions.

1. The study investigates the relationship between the properties of galaxies (such as color, luminosity, surface brightness, and concentration) and their environments using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey.
2. The study finds that galaxy clustering is a function of both star formation history and luminosity, with low-luminosity galaxies showing a strong correlation between clustering and color, and luminous galaxies showing a strong correlation between clustering and luminosity.
3. The study examines the dependence of galaxy properties on the large-scale density field, independent of the relationships with density on small scales, and finds that only the masses of the host halos of galaxies strongly affect their properties, supporting the ""halo model"" description of galaxy formation.
4. The study resolves a discrepancy between previous studies, finding that only small scales are important to the recent star formation history of galaxies, and that the apparent dependence on large scales in previous studies was likely due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the density estimates.
5. The study encourages the pursuit of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that depend only on the properties of the host halo, as the results suggest that the process of galaxy formation can be understood by considering only the properties of the host dark matter halos.

1. The paper describes a new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state, in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
2. The method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: the pure model in 2D and 3D, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-concentration impurities.
3. For the pure Hubbard model, the method properly interpolates between the weak and strong coupling limits, approaching the spin-wave theory (SWT) results as the interaction strength increases.
4. For the case of spin vacancies, the quantum spin-fluctuation correction is sharply enhanced, and the AF order parameter vanishes near the percolation threshold of the vacancies.
5. For the case of low-concentration impurities, the quantum spin-fluctuation correction is strongly suppressed on average, although it is enhanced locally at the impurity sites.
6. The local enhancement of spin fluctuations at the impurity sites is due to the increased magnon amplitude, while the overall suppression is due to the stiffening of the magnon spectrum in the low-energy sector.
7. The method can be readily extended to other situations involving defects in the AF, such as vacancies, impurities, and disorder, and provides a convenient way to study quantum spin-fluctuation effects.

1. The study introduces a formalism to address the dynamics of non-equilibrium, coupled, time-varying scalar fields, and shows that the one-loop corrections to the mean field evolution can be renormalized by dimensional regularization.

2. The authors apply the formalism to a two-field case, studying the behavior of the quantized mode functions and the effect of fluctuations on the zero mode equations of motion for various parameters, including small and large amplitude oscillations and large and weak coupling between the scalar fields.

3. As a special example, the authors choose a two-field inflationary model motivated by supersymmetry, where the fluctuations in the model lead to uneven contribution to the renormalized masses of the fields, resulting in an irregular trajectory of the zero mode in phase space and prohibiting excessive production of particles from the vacuum fluctuations.

1. The existence of dark matter (DM) has been established, and its thermal relic abundance has been determined by the WMAP experiment. The weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) would be a promising candidate for DM.
2. The paper presents an extension of the Higgs Triplet Model (HTM) where the tiny neutrino masses are generated at the one-loop level, and a DM candidate is naturally contained. The model introduces a Z2-even neutral scalar, a Z2-odd neutral real scalar, and a Z2-odd doublet scalar field.
3. The characteristic feature of the model is that the parameter responsible for the neutrino masses is much smaller than the mass scale of the new scalar fields, which can be probed at collider experiments through the production and decay of the charged scalar field.

1. The introduction of new quantum mechanical technologies, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), will require a new telecommunications infrastructure that can properly accommodate the quantum properties inherent in quantum communications.
2. To quantify the quantum behavior of optical devices, the authors propose a method based on the idea that a truly quantum channel should be distinguishable from a ""measure and prepare"" channel, which destroys any quantum correlations in bipartite states.
3. The authors develop a quantitative device-testing scheme that estimates the amount of effective entanglement observable in an optical system after transmission through an optical channel, using only homodyne measurement results and knowledge of the initial preparation.
4. The authors provide bounds on the overlap of the maximal eigenstates of the conditional output states and the off-diagonal elements of the projected density matrix, which are used to calculate a lower bound on the negativity of the full state.

1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided a wealth of information on subatomic physics over the past 83 years.
2. The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is related to the gyromagnetic ratio and the anomaly, which arises from radiative corrections.
3. The electron anomaly is measured to a high precision, and the muon anomaly is sensitive to higher mass scale radiative corrections.
4. The standard model value of the muon anomaly has contributions from QED, hadronic, and weak processes, and a significant difference between the experimental and standard model values would signify the presence of new physics.
5. The hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly cannot be directly calculated from QCD, but can be determined using dispersion theory and experimental data.
6. Supersymmetric contributions to the muon anomaly and electric dipole moment could be at a measurable level, and there is a complementarity between the muon anomaly, electric dipole moment, and lepton-flavor-violating processes.
7. The experimental measurement of the muon anomaly at Brookhaven National Laboratory has achieved a precision of 0.5 parts per million, and a new experiment is planned to further improve the precision.
8. The search for a permanent electric dipole moment of the muon is also being planned, with a design sensitivity that could probe physics beyond the standard model.

1. The paper presents a new design for an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.
2. The reactive coupling originates from the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator, leading to phase-dependent gradient forces.
3. The authors examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields and report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting, which was not observed in previous works that only considered dispersive coupling.
4. The Hamiltonian of the system is derived, and the time evolution of the expectation values of the system operators is solved.
5. The expectation value of the output fields is calculated, and the nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are obtained.
6. The authors find that normal mode splitting occurs in the output fields in the presence of reactive coupling, and the peak separation increases with increasing pump power.
7. The reactive coupling can also cause four-wave mixing, leading to the generation of an anti-Stokes component in the optomechanical system.
8. The results demonstrate that the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity is responsible for the observed normal mode splitting in the output fields.

1. The paper studies the dynamics of transverse magnetization in a quantum Ising chain out of equilibrium.
2. The authors introduce a new protocol to prepare an initial state with spatial inhomogeneity in transverse magnetization by including odd-occupation basis states in the fermionic momentum space.
3. The dynamics driven by a homogeneous and constant transverse field cannot make the magnetization homogeneous even after infinite time, which is counterintuitive.
4. The local magnetization at different sites exhibits two different timescales of oscillation, with the larger timescale showing a generic power-law decay of the envelope.
5. The exponent of the power-law decay is independent of the strength of the external field, indicating the absence of thermalization.
6. The frequency of the characteristic oscillation is a monotonic function of the external field in the ordered phase, but becomes independent of the field in the disordered phase, manifesting the quantum phase transition.
7. The transverse magnetization after infinite time at each site shows different functional behavior in the ordered and disordered phases, producing a non-analyticity at the critical point.
8. The observed features of the dynamics are valid for a wide range of initial configurations, despite the integrability of the Hamiltonian.
9. The authors suggest that the behavior of non-local observables and the dynamics in non-integrable systems starting from such inhomogeneous initial states could be interesting topics for future investigation.

1. Studying QCD at finite baryon density is important for understanding the structure of compact stars and conditions near the core of collapsing stars.
2. Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase, which was proposed several decades ago.
3. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, and the charge neutrality condition and beta equilibrium are required to form bulk matter inside compact stars.
4. Homogeneous neutral cold-dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2SC) phase or gapless CFL (gCFL) phase, and these gapless phases exhibit chromomagnetic instability.
5. The g2SC phase also exhibits a paramagnetic response to an external baryon current, suggesting a baryon current can be spontaneously generated, breaking the rotational symmetry of the system.
6. The author describes the 2SC phase in the nonlinear realization framework, showing that each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding pseudo Nambu-Goldstone current.
7. The author points out that there exists a narrow unstable LOFF (us-LOFF) window, where not only off-diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8th gluon cannot avoid the magnetic instability, and this instability cannot be cured by off-diagonal gluon condensate.
8. The author suggests that the us-LOFF window will also show up in some constrained abelian asymmetric superfluid system, bringing a new challenge to understand how a BCS superconductor will be eventually destroyed by increasing the mismatch.
9. The author emphasizes the need to go beyond the mean-field approximation to correctly describe the system, as the low degrees of freedom become important with the increase of mismatch.

1. The debate about the properties of the melting phase transition of two-dimensional (2D) systems has been ongoing for several decades.
2. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is the most widely accepted theory for the 2D melting transition, which suggests two separate continuous transitions.
3. However, experimental and simulation results have shown a wide range of phase transition behaviors, including first-order, second-order, and KTHNY-like transitions, depending on the type of interparticle interactions and system parameters.
4. The author's simulations of repulsive screened Coulomb (Yukawa) systems reveal that the observation of the hexatic phase is strongly linked to the thermodynamic equilibration of the system, and the necessary equilibration time depends on the measured quantity of interest.
5. The author finds that the relaxation of the velocity distribution, configurational temperature, and long-range correlations occur on vastly different timescales, with the long-range correlations taking significantly longer to equilibrate, especially in larger systems.
6. The author suggests that the rapid increase in computational resources in the past decade may have led to many studies overlooking the importance of proper equilibration, potentially resulting in the identification of metastable hexatic phases instead of the true equilibrium configurations.

1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4,100 planetary candidates in 3,200 systems, revealing that small planets (Earth-sized to Neptune-sized) are nearly ubiquitous around stars of all types. However, the planetary radii derived from the Kepler data may be systematically underestimated if the host stars are actually part of undetected multiple star systems.

2. The authors explore the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and the resulting derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. They find that if the Kepler stars are assumed to be single (as in the current Kepler Objects of Interest list) and no companion vetting is performed, the planetary radii are underestimated, on average, by a factor of 1.5, corresponding to an overestimation of the planet bulk density by a factor of 1.8.

3. The authors show that if the Kepler candidates are vetted with radial velocity observations and high-resolution imaging, the planetary radius mean correction necessary to account for undetected companions is reduced significantly to a factor of 1.1. This benefit is even more pronounced for the K2 and TESS missions, where the targets are, on average, ten times closer than the Kepler targets, and single-epoch high-resolution imaging may be the most effective and efficient means of reducing the mean planetary radius correction factor.

1. The range of HI column densities seen in nearby galaxy disks is similar to those in damped Lyman-α systems (DLAs), making it an attractive experiment to map the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission.
2. However, such studies are currently impossible due to the weakness of the 21-cm line and the rapid decrease in the redshift number density of DLAs towards lower redshifts.
3. While there are now about 100 DLA galaxies known at low redshifts, most of them are faint, low-surface-brightness dwarfs, making them difficult to identify.
4. Using a sample of 355 local galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the authors find that the HI column density distribution function shows only mild evolution from redshift 0 to higher redshifts, and that the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate and metallicities of DLAs.
5. The authors find that 87% of the DLA cross-section is in galaxies fainter than M_B = -20, and 45% is in galaxies with M_B > -18, consistent with the observed properties of DLA host galaxies.
6. The authors also find that the expected median impact parameter of DLA systems is 7.8 kpc, implying that very high spatial resolution imaging is required to successfully identify a typical DLA galaxy at intermediate redshifts.

1. The vast majority of stars are formed in star clusters, but only a modest percentage of the gas is turned into stars during the initial collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud.
2. After the onset of stellar winds and supernovae explosions, the gas within the embedded cluster is removed on timescales shorter than a crossing time, leaving the cluster out of equilibrium due to the rapid change in gravitational potential energy.
3. Studies attempting to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in young clusters by assuming virial equilibrium have found discrepant results, with some reporting non-standard IMFs and others reporting standard IMFs.
4. The authors provide evidence that three young massive clusters (M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1) are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss, which calls into question claims of a varying stellar IMF.
5. The authors model star clusters using N-body simulations and show that the observed excess of light at large radii in the luminosity profiles of the three clusters is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion.
6. The authors suggest that the escaping stars during the violent relaxation process can lead to artificially high velocity dispersions, resulting in inaccurate mass estimates based on the assumption of stellar virial equilibrium.
7. The observations and simulations presented support the scenario of ""infant mortality,"" where low star formation efficiency (less than 30%) can lead to the rapid dissolution of young clusters.
8. The authors note that the preferential loss of low-mass stars due to equipartition is unlikely to occur in these young clusters, as they are too young for this process to have taken place.
9. The authors conclude that the signatures of violent relaxation after gas expulsion seen in the luminosity profiles of the three clusters suggest that these clusters are not in virial equilibrium, and this should be taken into account when studying the IMF and other properties of young star clusters.

1. The authors numerically investigate the relation between quantum fluctuation, tunneling, and decoherence combined with the delocalization in wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field.

2. They classify the motions in the parameter space into coherent motions and irregular motions, and find that the critical value that divides the behavior depends on the number of frequency components.

3. Within the regular motion range, the period of the tunneling oscillation is reduced with an increase in the number of colors and/or strength of the perturbation, which can be explained by the increase of the instanton tunneling rate due to the appearance of the stochastic layer near the separatrix.

4. In the irregular motion in the polychromatically perturbed cases, the growth of the uncertainty product initially increases and saturates at a certain level due to quantum interference, while in the stochastically perturbed case, the uncertainty product grows unboundedly.

5. The quantum fluctuation is always larger for the classically chaotic trajectories compared to the regular ones, and the partial quantum fluctuation in the semiquantal approximation enhances the chaotic behavior.

6. The classical phase space portraits show that increasing the perturbation strength destroys the separatrix and forms a chaotic layer, and the increase of the number of colors contributes to the increase of the width of the stochastic layer.

7. The authors provide a simple explanation for the perturbed instanton tunneling picture, where the appearance of the stochastic layer enhances the tunneling rate.

8. The authors expect that the transition observed in the quantum dynamics corresponds to the quantum signatures of the KAM transition from the regular to chaotic dynamics in the classical system.

9. The authors suggest that the number of degrees of freedom of the total system, which corresponds to the number of frequency components, can be related to the occurrence of dissipative behavior in the quantum system.

2. Significant progress has been made in understanding condensed phase dynamics within the context of a few prototypical models, such as the Caldeira-Leggett model and the spin-boson model, where the environment is typically modeled as a bosonic bath.

3. However, more and more physical and chemical studies have suggested the essential roles that other bath models, such as anharmonic environments, fermionic baths, and spin baths, assume in dissipative quantum dynamics.

4. The paper introduces a stochastic formulation of quantum dissipation that can incorporate all three fundamental bath models: non-interacting bosons, fermions, and spins.

5. The paper presents a family of deterministic numerical methods, collectively referred to as the Generalized Hierarchical Equations (GHE), to solve the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) for various bath models.

6. The paper discusses the treatment of bosonic, fermionic, and non-Gaussian (spin) bath models within the GHE framework, including the use of spectral expansion and the generalized hierarchical equation of motion (GHEOM) approach.

7. For spin bath models, the paper introduces a dual-fermion mapping that transforms each spin into a pair of coupled fermions, allowing the non-Gaussian properties of the spin bath to be recast in terms of Gaussian processes in an extended space.

8. The paper presents numerical examples to illustrate the methods discussed, including the application of the dual-fermion GHE to the pure dephasing model with an Ohmic spin bath and the spin star model.

6. This shift is attributed to two effects: the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and a systematic inaccuracy of the 2D approximation used to model the 3D resonators.
7. The authors compare the semiclassical trace formula to an exact trace formula for the 2D dielectric circle resonator and find that the former needs to be improved for POs close to the critical angle.
8. The systematic error of the 2D approximation proved to be rather small, allowing for the identification of the different PO contributions, but its magnitude cannot be estimated a priori.
9. The authors suggest that an analytical approach more accurate than the 2D approximation would be of great interest, as well as the development of a trace formula for 3D dielectric cavities.

1. The merger of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star are important sources of gravitational waves (GW) due to the huge energy released in the process.
2. The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) may radiate about 10^6 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4-1.6 kHz, which is the range covered by most ground-based laser interferometers.
3. The gravitational wave background spectrum produced by DNS coalescences was estimated using numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo methods. The density parameter Ω_gw has a maximum around 670 Hz (630 Hz for a different star formation rate model), with an amplitude of about 10^-9, which is below the sensitivity of the first and second generation of detectors.
4. However, using the planned sensitivity of third-generation interferometers, such as the European Antenna (EGO), the cross-correlation of two coincident antennas could yield an optimized signal-to-noise ratio of about 10 after one year of integration. The ""popcorn"" contribution, which is one order of magnitude higher, can also be detected using new data analysis techniques.

1. The paper presents an analytical treatment of the nonlinear shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles, which can significantly modify the shock structure and the spectrum of the accelerated particles.

2. The authors show that the critical behavior, characterized by the appearance of multiple solutions, occurs not only for the case of acceleration of particles from the thermal pool but also for the case of reacceleration of a pre-existing population of cosmic rays.

3. The presence of seed particles can dominate the nonlinearity of the shock, even for low injection efficiencies of particles from the thermal pool, suggesting that this effect may be important in astrophysical environments where cosmic rays are in rough equipartition with the gas, such as in supernova remnants.

4. The implications of nonlinear shock reacceleration on the nonthermal activity in astrophysical environments and the spectra of secondary nuclei resulting from spallation processes are discussed as potential areas for further investigation.

1. The source document discusses the implications of f(T) gravity, a modified theory of gravity based on torsion instead of curvature, on the formation of light elements in the early universe during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) phase. The authors examine three viable f(T) models and confront them with BBN calculations based on observational data on the primordial abundance of Helium-4.

2. The authors show that the viable f(T) models can satisfy the BBN constraints, which acts as an additional advantage of f(T) gravity as a successful candidate for describing the gravitational interaction. The constraints obtained from BBN are in agreement with the constraints obtained using other observational data, further strengthening the viability of f(T) gravity.

1. The paper considers a bidirectional relay network where two users exchange information through a relay node, and proposes an optimal mode selection and power allocation policy to maximize the average sum rate.
2. The network consists of six possible transmission modes, and the proposed policy adaptively selects the optimal mode and allocates the optimal powers to the transmitting nodes in each time slot based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and the long-term channel statistics.
3. The optimal policy is derived by formulating an optimization problem and solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which show that the optimal policy selects only four out of the six possible transmission modes and does not require time-sharing.
4. The proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols, especially at low total power budgets, due to the adaptive power allocation, and can be used as a benchmark for other suboptimal protocols.
5. The paper also analyzes the optimal thresholds for the mode selection and power allocation, and proves that the binary relaxation of the mode selection variables does not affect the maximum achievable sum rate.
6. The delay analysis of the proposed protocol is left for future research, as the focus of the current work is on maximizing the sum rate.

2. The interpretation of the low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
3. The sound horizon depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, and these quantities are robustly measured in the CMB.
4. The acoustic peak method of probing dark energy is robust, as it depends only on the redshift of equality, which is well measured in the CMB.
5. Other cosmological measurements, both at high and low redshifts, can measure the actual densities and constrain the presence of unknown relativistic species.
6. The anisotropies of the CMB have good leverage on the redshift of matter-radiation equality, and the CMB, perhaps in combination with other probes, can constrain the actual matter and radiation densities.
7. The standard ruler defined by the acoustic oscillations prior to recombination can deal with uncertainties in the matter density, provided that the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well measured.

2. Network analysis methods can be used to investigate the contact structure among individuals and analyze the effects of this structure on the spread of a disease.
3. Scale-free networks, which show a power-law degree distribution, are commonly observed in real-world networks and may have epidemiological implications.
4. The authors generated scale-free networks using different algorithms and simulated the spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases on these networks.
5. The results show that the topological structure of the networks, rather than just the degree distribution, can significantly impact the dynamics and prevalence of the simulated diseases.
6. Among the undirected networks, the networks generated using the MB algorithm had the lowest prevalence, while among the directed networks, the BA networks had the lowest prevalence.
7. The increase in the number of edges in the networks led to an increase in the prevalence of the diseases, indicating that the intensification of interactions between individuals may promote the spread of diseases.

1. The Levi-Civita (LC) spacetime presents serious challenges in its interpretation, particularly regarding the parameter ω₀, which describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass.
2. For small ω₀, LC describes the spacetime of an infinite line mass, but for larger values, the interpretation becomes unclear, as the spacetime exhibits unusual properties, such as the absence of circular timelike geodesics and the decrease of the Kretschmann scalar with increasing ω₀.
3. Proposed interpretations suggest that LC may represent the spacetime of a cylinder whose radius increases with ω₀ and becomes a plane as ω₀ approaches the critical value ω₁.
4. The interpretation of the ω₁ case as a plane source is problematic, as it exhibits an asymmetry between positive and negative mass densities, which is difficult to understand intuitively.
5. The authors propose to analyze the behavior of a gyroscope circumventing the axis of symmetry in the LC and C-metric spacetimes to provide additional insights into the interpretation of these metrics.
6. The analysis of the gyroscope precession reveals differences between the ω₁ and ω₁₄ cases of the LC metric, further questioning the interpretation of these cases as representing a plane source.
7. The interpretation of the coordinate ϕ in the LC metric with ω₁ as an angle coordinate appears to be untenable, as it leads to contradictions when compared to the C-metric with similar interpretations.
8. The absence of singularities in the physical components of the curvature tensor for the ω₁ case of the LC metric remains unexplained, although it is likely related to the restrictions on the coordinate system.
9. The interpretation of the ω₁₄ case as a plane source is also questionable, as the arguments based on the equivalence principle do not seem to apply in this case.
10. The authors conclude that the interpretations of the LC metric, particularly for the ω₁ and ω₁₄ cases, are still not fully resolved and require further investigation.

1. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of hadron production in 200 GeV proton-proton (pp) collisions, including the measurement of single-particle spectra, pseudorapidity densities, and two-dimensional angular correlations. The results are described by a three-component model consisting of a soft component (longitudinal projectile dissociation), a hard component (parton fragmentation to minimum-bias dijets), and a significant non-jet quadrupole component.

2. The observed trends of dijet production and the non-jet quadrupole component suggest that the concept of ""centrality"" is not a useful one for pp collisions, as it is inconsistent with the eikonal approximation and the lack of dependence on the initial-state eccentricity. Instead, the event-wise depth of penetration on momentum fraction of the projectile wave functions may be the main source of variation for the different components.

3. The presence of a significant non-jet quadrupole component and its multiplicity dependence have implications for the interpretation of the ""same-side ridge"" observed in high-energy pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The ridge is shown to result from the interplay between the jet-related away-side peak and the non-jet quadrupole, rather than from a collective hydrodynamic phenomenon.

2. The authors investigate the localization length of light in one-dimensional disordered metamaterials, both homogeneous (composed of right-handed materials) and mixed (with alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials).
3. For homogeneous stacks, the localization length shows a quadratic dependence on the wavelength at long wavelengths, and it saturates to a constant value at short wavelengths. The localization length is modulated by the transmission bands and gaps, and this modulation decreases with increasing disorder.
4. The localization length in the first gap is practically independent of the disorder, while it is enhanced at the center of each allowed band due to Fabry-Perot resonances.
5. For low-disordered mixed stacks and wavelengths much larger than the grating period, the localization length exhibits a linear dependence on the wavelength, with a slope inversely proportional to the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.
6. When the condition of equal optical path in the layers is not satisfied, the localization length presents an irregular form in both the allowed and forbidden bands, with more pronounced changes in the mixed stacks.
7. The authors derive analytical expressions for the localization length in the long-wavelength limit for both homogeneous and mixed stacks, which agree well with their numerical results.
8. The effects of absorption on the localization length are also discussed, and a final expression is provided for the low-disordered mixed stacks and weak absorption metamaterials.

3. Dark matter is necessary to explain the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the luminous matter, and it plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures.
4. The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) formula provides a successful empirical description of the rotation curves of galaxies, suggesting a modification of gravity in the weak field regime.
5. Attempts to develop a relativistic theory of modified gravity, such as tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) theory, have had limited success in explaining both galactic and cosmological observations.
6. An alternative approach is to consider a particular form of dark matter, such as dipolar dark matter, which can reproduce the MOND phenomenology while being consistent with cosmological observations.
7. The dipolar dark matter model offers a unification of dark energy and dark matter, with the natural order of magnitude of the cosmological constant being compatible with the MOND acceleration scale.

3. Physicists often study simplified models of heteropolymers to gain more general information, such as polyampholytes (PAs) - flexible chains with randomly charged monomers.
4. The behavior of PAs is strongly influenced by the long-range nature of the Coulomb interactions and the randomness of the charge sequence.
5. The ground state energy of PAs is primarily determined by their net charge, with a small dependence on the specific charge sequence.
6. PAs with small net charges tend to form compact globular structures, while those with large net charges adopt stretched configurations.
7. The heat capacity of PAs exhibits a peak at low temperatures, suggesting the possibility of a ""glass"" transition, although this requires further investigation.

5. The numerical computations of the transverse distribution function demonstrate that it possesses a bimodal shape in the intermediate range of chain lengths, consistent with recent studies on the two-dimensional wormlike chain.
6. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the transverse distribution function of the three-dimensional chain shows only a tiny peak at the onset of bimodality, which disappears for larger chain lengths.

2. The main goal of the paper is to prove that the core entropy function extends to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers.
3. The paper develops combinatorial tools to deal with growth rates of countable graphs, which may be of independent interest.
4. The paper associates an infinite graph to any external angle, and shows that the growth rate of this graph varies continuously as a function of the angle.
5. For rational angles, the growth rate of the associated graph coincides with the core entropy.
6. The continuity of the core entropy function is proven by leveraging an algorithm devised by Thurston, which considers pairs of postcritical angles.

1. The detection of afterglows from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggests that most long GRBs are of cosmological origin, and the fireball model is strongly favored. However, the puzzle of GRBs is not yet fully resolved, and one major problem is determining whether GRBs are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs.

2. The authors propose that there should be many ""failed gamma-ray bursts"" (FGRBs), which are baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factors much less than 100 but still much greater than unity. These FGRBs can produce prominent afterglows, and their orphan afterglows can be mistaken for those from jetted GRBs, making it difficult to distinguish between the two.

3. The authors suggest several possible solutions to help discriminate between orphan afterglows from FGRBs and jetted GRBs, such as improving detection limits, associating orphans with fast X-ray transients, observing the rising phase of orphans, and using radio observations, gravitational waves, or neutrino radiation.

4. The authors conclude that measuring the GRB beaming angle using orphan afterglow searches is extremely difficult, and special attention should be paid to the observation and study of FGRBs, which can provide valuable information for understanding GRB progenitors and the fireball model under different conditions.

1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmic bursts of gamma-rays that are highly elusive and mysterious events in the universe, typically lasting less than a minute.
2. Since 1997, it is known that GRBs also produce X-ray afterglows, which can be detected for several hours or days after the burst.
3. The authors report on two observations of GRB afterglows using the XMM-Newton satellite: GRB 011211 and GRB 001025.
4. The X-ray spectra of the afterglows can be described by a simple power-law with a photon index of around 2, which is typical for GRB afterglows.
5. No significant absorption above the Galactic value was detected in the X-ray spectra, contrary to expectations that GRBs may occur in high-density star-forming regions.
6. The authors found no definitive evidence for the presence of a line complex at a redshift of 1.88 in the X-ray spectrum of GRB 011211, as previously reported.

1. Fe-based superconductors (FeSCs) are a class of high-Tc superconductors with an unconventional superconducting state. The origin of the superconducting state is still debated.
2. FeSCs can be divided into two subclasses, pnictides and chalcogenides, with a square lattice of iron as the basic element. The Fermi surface consists of two hole sheets around the Γ point and two electron sheets around the M and X points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.
3. Nesting between these Fermi surface sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which can result in different superconducting gap symmetries, such as extended s-wave (s±) or s-wave (s++).
4. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments have reported a well-defined peak in the neutron spectra, which is commonly explained as a spin resonance due to the s± state. However, recent experimental results have shown the presence of at least two distinct superconducting gaps in FeSCs, raising questions about the interpretation of the spin resonance.
5. The authors analyze the spin response of FeSCs with two different superconducting gap scales and provide a criterion to determine whether the observed peak in inelastic neutron scattering is the true spin resonance, which is related to the indirect gap scale determined by the sum of gaps on the Fermi surface sheets connected by the scattering wave vector.

1. The authors introduce a 2D generalization of the dual random dimer model (2D-DRDM), where impurities cannot be first neighbors, and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites.
2. In the non-interacting regime, the 2D-DRDM exhibits a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized, independent of the system dimensionality.
3. In the presence of weak interactions, the 2D-DRDM drives the homogeneity of the ground state, leading to a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, with an enhancement around the resonance energy.
4. The authors introduce a mode-matching argument that includes the effect of interactions, showing that the resonance energy is at the origin of these phenomena, and the shift in the minimum position of the inverse participation ratio is due to the healing length.

2. Measurement device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) removes the potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard QKD.

3. The authors propose two schemes of phase-encoding MDI-QKD and prove their unconditional security, considering the basis-dependent flaw.

4. The first scheme based on phase locking can tolerate some imperfections in the phase modulation, while the second scheme based on phase-to-polarization conversion requires very precise state preparation.

5. The authors analyze the effect of imperfect state preparation on the key generation rate for both schemes and find that accurate state preparation is crucial for the security of not only MDI-QKD but also standard QKD.

6. The authors show that the achievable distance of the second scheme drops significantly with the degradation of the phase modulation accuracy, suggesting the need for a high-fidelity photon source and accurate estimation of the fidelity.

7. The authors remark that the accurate preparation of the state is important not only in MDI-QKD but also in standard QKD, where Eve can exploit the imbalance of the quantum coin to enhance the attack.

2. Recent observations using high-resolution imaging have uncovered the environment surrounding individual massive protostellar systems, suggesting an accretion formation scenario for massive stars.
3. The mid-infrared (MIR) window offers a powerful view of hot molecular cores, which are associated with regions of massive star formation.
4. The authors observed three star-forming regions traced by methanol maser emission at high spatial resolution in the MIR and found multiple sources with different morphological types.
5. The methanol masers are found closest to the brightest MIR point source, indicating that these sources have the necessary conditions for maser emission.
6. The time scale for a source at the core edge to migrate to the center is comparable to the hot molecular core lifetime, suggesting that large protostellar motions within the core are possible.
7. Monte Carlo simulations show that it is difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the initial mass function (IMF).

2. MFs have been predicted to occur as quasi-particle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems, and they exhibit non-Abelian statistics, which is important for potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing.
3. The authors propose an optical measurement scheme to detect the existence of MFs in iron chains on the superconducting Pb surface via a coupled hybrid quantum dot (QD)-nanomechanical resonator (NR) system with optical pump-probe technology.
4. The interaction between MFs in iron chains and the QD in the hybrid QD-NR system is mainly due to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the change in the coherent optical spectrum of the QD is a potential signature for the detection of MFs.
5. The vibration of the NR acting as a phonon cavity will enhance the exciton resonance spectrum significantly and make MFs more sensitive to be detectable.
6. The optical scheme proposed can provide another method for the detection of MFs, which is different from the zero-bias peak in the tunneling experiments.

3. The accreting WD model suggests two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super-soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel, which predict the companion stars that lead to SNe Ia.
4. The authors propose a direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the supernova ejecta by observing the absorption lines with broad blue wings, which are formed by Fe II in the ejecta.
5. The authors estimate the amount of Fe I in the ejecta of the Tycho's supernova remnant and discuss the possibility of identifying the Fe I absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star.

3. Eve can exploit the fluctuation of LO intensity to reduce the channel excess noise and obtain partial or full secret keys without being detected, especially in reverse reconciliation.

QCMs can produce identical copies, non-identical copies, or copies with varying quality depending on the conditions of their design.

The authors use a natural criterion, minimizing the integral average of the distance between the initial and output states, to determine the parameters of the QCM. The fidelity of the initial and output states on the real part of the Bloch sphere exceeds the value of 5/6, which is higher than the universal QCM for pure states due to the non-universality of the QCM and the fact that it only copies a part of the two-partite state.

6. The authors used the ""heartbeat"" oscillations as a ""standard candle"" to constrain the system parameters and found that the faintness of IGR J17091-3624 is likely due to its low or negative spin, in contrast to the high spin of the black hole in GRS 1915+105.
7. The authors also explored the possibility of a high-mass black hole in IGR J17091-3624, which would require a high inclination angle and spin, but this scenario is less likely.
8. The authors conclude that the extreme variability in IGR J17091-3624 is not primarily driven by the black hole spin, but rather by the high accretion rate.
9. The discovery of similar variability patterns in IGR J17091-3624 establishes that the extreme variability observed in GRS 1915+105 is not a unique feature of that particular BHB.
10. The authors suggest that IGR J17091-3624 could be the first known astrophysical source with a retrograde black hole spin, which would be a very challenging scenario to explain.

1. The extinction curve describes how the extinction changes with wavelength and is due to the presence of dust grains in the interstellar medium. The knowledge of the extinction curve is necessary to deredden magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and to understand the physical properties of dust grains.

2. The authors extend the analysis of Cardelli et al.

They introduce weights associated with the errors in each UV band to their chi-square minimization procedure and explicitly give all the formulae used to compute R_V and its errors.

3. The authors present the sky distribution of R_V values and show their behavior as a function of galactic coordinates. They also emphasize how R_V values change with different calibrations of the B-V color excess.

1. The paper discusses the use of a triangular triple quantum dot (tTQD) system as a qubit for quantum computation.
2. The qubit is encoded in the doublet subspace of the tTQD, and the symmetry of the system can be controlled by applying an electric field to manipulate the exchange interactions between the spins.
3. The authors propose a new method for reading out the qubit state, called the ""doublet blockade effect,"" which is based on the asymmetry of the tunnel rates between the doublet states and the electrodes.
4. The dynamics of the qubit, including coherent oscillations and relaxation processes, are studied, taking into account the presence of the electrodes and the leakage from the doublet subspace.
5. The authors also investigate the effects of spin-flip processes in the electrodes, which mix the doublet subspaces with different spin orientations, and find that the total mixing time is very long, promising for manipulation and readout of the qubit.
6. The authors demonstrate that the tTQD system can be used to perform single-qubit operations, such as the Pauli X and Z gates, by rapidly changing the orientation of the electric field.
7. The estimated relaxation and decoherence times for the tTQD qubit are on the order of nanoseconds, which are comparable to the decoherence time due to hyperfine interactions in GaAs-based quantum dots.

2. The Z Andromedae (Z And) binary system consists of a cool giant and a hot compact component, and has experienced several periods of activity over the past century.
3. The 1984-1986 outburst of Z And is characterized by a double-peaked structure and low brightness, which is explained by the collision of the WD wind with two ejected shells from the RG.
4. The detailed modeling of the UV line spectra reveals that the minimum of the light curve between the two peaks is accompanied by a sharp drop in the ionization parameter, due to the sudden increase in the distance between the WD and the downstream nebula.
5. The small peaks in the light curve before and after the 1984-1986 burst are most likely due to RG shell ejections, with a periodicity of about 300-400 days.
6. Broad lines and collimated jets, which are observed in other symbiotic systems during outbursts, were not observed during the 1984-1986 outburst of Z And.
7. The fit of the calculated continuum spectral energy distribution (SED) to the observed data confirms a strong self-absorption of free-free radiation from the nebulae at frequencies below 10^10 Hz.
8. The drop in the ionization parameter between November and December 1985 is most likely due to the sudden increase in the distance from the hot source, caused by the ejection of a new shell in the RG atmosphere.
9. The outburst did not attain its maximum luminosity because the collision of the wind network was distorted by the oncoming of the next shell.

2. SWCNT networks can be viewed as a two-dimensional network of conducting one-dimensional rods, which are either metallic or semiconducting.
3. The junction resistance between nanotubes is much larger than the resistance of the nanotubes themselves, leading to the network behaving as a system with randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport.
4. The frequency-dependent and electric-field-dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks have been investigated, and the results show that the onset frequency and the length scale extracted from the measurements are related.
5. The authors investigated the frequency- and electric-field-dependent conductivity of SWCNT networks with systematically varying densities.
6. The onset frequency extracted from the frequency dependence measurement increases with the film thickness, while the length scale extracted from the electric field-dependent measurement decreases at the same time.
7. The authors developed an empirical relation between the onset frequency and the length scale extracted from the two transport measurement methods.
8. The authors found that the poor interbundle junctions affect the transport behavior of the carriers in the SWCNT films, causing strong thickness dependence of the characteristic length scales.
9. The authors estimated the mobility of carriers in the SWCNT networks, which is much smaller than that of individual SWCNTs due to the randomly distributed barriers for electrical transport.

2. The scheme utilizes a three-qubit phase gate and single-qubit gates to implement Grover's algorithm, which simplifies the implementation and reduces the probability of errors compared to using a series of two-qubit gates.
3. The authors analyze the effects of various imperfections, including spontaneous decay from the intermediate level, cavity decay, and unwanted off-resonant interactions, on the fidelity and success probability of the three-qubit phase gate and the overall Grover's algorithm.
4. The results show that the marked state can be searched with high fidelity even in the presence of these imperfections, provided that the cavity decay rate and the decay rate of the intermediate level are sufficiently small.
5. The proposed implementation scheme is significantly faster than the conventional gate decomposition method, with an estimated total operational time of around 13 nanoseconds for the three-qubit Grover's algorithm.
6. The authors also discuss the advantages of their scheme, such as not requiring the adjustment of SQUID level spacing or slowly changing Rabi frequencies, and the ability to accommodate non-uniformity in device parameters.

The core-level spectrum of pristine graphene shows a peak tailing characteristic of metallic systems, despite graphene not being a metal. The tailing increases with doping for doping concentrations exceeding a certain threshold.

2. The authors derive the Fokker-Planck equation describing the dynamics of the system in the limit of large population sizes and analyze the stationary probability distribution, which reveals that asymmetries in mutation probabilities and nonlinear fitness functions can lead to the emergence of multiple stable points in the dynamics.
3. The authors show that the Fokker-Planck approximation works well for weak selection, but deviates from the exact solution of the master equation for strong selection. They also provide an exact solution of the master equation, which can be used to study the system dynamics for all selection strengths.
4. The authors conclude that in real biological systems, multiple metastable equilibria may exist whenever species interact in a way that implies a nonlinear frequency-dependent fitness, leading to sudden shifts in the population composition even in the absence of environmental changes.

1. The phase-field method has become a popular technique for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity.
2. However, there are still some fundamental questions that remain open, such as the thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models and the appropriate equation of motion for the orientation field in polycrystalline solidification.
3. The inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations also poses challenges, as the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
4. The temperature jump at the solid-liquid interface in the phase-field model is a physical effect, but it can generate problems for simulations if the interface thickness is increased to make computations feasible.
5. The antitrapping current can be used to eliminate the temperature jump, but it cannot address a second, independent thin-interface effect, the Kapitza resistance.
6. The standard equation of motion for the orientation field in orientation-field models does not correctly describe the microscopic evolution of the orientation field, as it does not take into account the connectivity of matter and the resulting geometrical conservation laws.
7. The inclusion of fluctuations in the phase-field equations is subject to caution, as the use of the simple prescription can be more precise for larger interface thickness and coarser grids, contrary to the usual point of view in phase-field modelling.
8. The development of quantitative models for specific materials remains a challenging task, as the renormalization of the free energy due to fluctuations needs to be investigated, and the control of discretization effects is crucial.
9. The further development of the phase-field method remains an exciting research topic at the frontiers of physics, mathematics, and materials science, as it requires the pursuit and confrontation of both its representation of condensed-matter systems and its use as an efficient simulation tool.

2. Spectroscopic methods are crucial for accurately measuring stellar parameters, as they can determine metallicity and avoid the problem of reddening inherent in photometry.
3. The authors developed a new method to determine the fundamental parameters of FGK stars, which includes using the Balmer line method for effective temperature, NLTE ionization balance of Fe for surface gravity and metallicity, and restricting the Fe lines to those with excitation potential greater than 2 eV.
4. Comparison of the new NLTE-opt method to the widely-used 1D LTE excitation-ionization of Fe (LTE-Fe) method reveals significant systematic biases in the latter, with differences increasing with decreasing metallicity.
5. The large differences between the NLTE-opt and LTE-Fe estimates of atmospheric parameters can significantly impact the derived stellar properties, such as mass, age, and distance.
6. The authors find that a reliable effective temperature scale, such as the Balmer scale, is critical for accurate spectral parameter analysis, and that NLTE effects on the ionization balance are necessary to eliminate discrepancies between Fe and Fe lines.
7. The implications of the differences between the NLTE-opt and LTE-Fe methods extend beyond just the characterization of stars, as they can affect the derived properties of the Milky Way, such as abundance gradients and the identification of different halo components.

2. Weak lensing can also be detected through the fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe.
3. The authors use a sample of 74 SNe Ia from the largest homogeneous compilation, and find that brighter SNe Ia are preferentially found behind regions overdense in foreground galaxies, as traced by the APM galaxy survey.
4. The authors perform various tests to ensure that this correlation is not due to chance or galactic dust, and conclude that it is likely caused by weak gravitational lensing.
5. The authors develop a simple lensing model to interpret the observed correlation, which includes the mass distribution, biasing scheme, and dispersion in the intrinsic magnitudes of SNe Ia.
6. The authors find that the slope of the correlation is most sensitive to the mass distribution, and is largely independent of the biasing scheme.
7. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for the use of SNe Ia as standard candles, and suggest that a large uniform set of intermediate-redshift SNe Ia would be invaluable for studying mass clustering in the nearby universe.

1. The study of the kinetics of polymer loop formation has gained renewed attention due to its importance in biological processes such as genetic expression, replication, and recombination.
2. Experiments have shown that the presence of static tension on the DNA can dramatically increase the looping time, especially for longer chains, due to the cooperativity of the chain arising from chain connectivity.
3. In the presence of time-dependent, dichotomically fluctuating tension, the looping time exhibits a resonant minimum at an optimal flipping time, which is a nontrivial extension of the resonant activation phenomenon observed in single Brownian particles.
4. The effect of time-dependent tension is more significant for longer chains, and the results are consistent with recent experiments for both static and fluctuating tension cases.

The paper introduces a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light. This method can monitor the relative distance between the sources in the range 10-500 nm, with a precision that is not limited by diffraction, but by the microstructure of the scattering medium.

2. The paper also shows that for two incoherent sources in a disordered medium, the speckle contrast measured in a single speckle spot is proportional to the fluctuations of the cross-density of states (CDOS) connecting the two sources, which encodes the information on the interdistance between the sources. This provides an alternative approach to the Green's function retrieval technique, where the Green's function is encoded in the noise due to two fluctuating incoherent sources measured at a single point.

2. The topological insulators have been intensively studied because of the existence and potential applications of robust surface metallic states, and they are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction.
3. It has been proposed that an extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase, which is often called a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
4. The stability of the TMI and estimation of the critical value of interaction on the honeycomb lattice have mainly been considered by mean-field calculations, which cannot treat the correlation effect satisfactorily.
5. The authors found that the long-range charge density wave (CDW) becomes stable over the TMI phase in standard honeycomb lattice models, but by tuning the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones, the TMI can be stabilized.
6. The authors used the multi-variable variational Monte Carlo (MVMC) method to study the effect of on-site Coulomb interaction, which was expected to be unchanged at the level of mean-field approximation, and found that it decreases the value of the order parameter of the TMI.

4. For cluster data sets with low photometric error (< 0.015 mag), the ""Av rms"" and ""Av slope"" methods can determine Av to an accuracy of 0.3, with some systematic biases.
5. The ""optical/IR"" method generally provides relatively imprecise estimates of Av, with an uncertainty of 0.5, over the full range of photometric errors explored.
6. The scatter in the cluster HB is used to estimate that the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust map averages over small-scale reddening variations that are 10% of the mean reddening value.
7. The small-scale power spectrum of the foreground dust, derived from the cluster optical data, matches smoothly onto the larger-scale power spectrum derived from the Schlegel et al. (1998) reddening map, and is well fit by a power law with a spectral index of -1.7.
8. The methods presented in this paper can be applied to other high-quality, multi-band photometric data sets for differentially-reddened star clusters to probe the nature of dust along many lines of sight.

1. The authors present detailed dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations for the Kondo lattice model on a square lattice, allowing for antiferromagnetic order.
2. They find no evidence of Kondo breakdown throughout the phase diagram, even deep in the antiferromagnetically ordered state, and the observed quasiparticle gap can be interpreted in terms of Kondo screening.
3. The transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is continuous and is associated with the backfolding of the large heavy fermion Fermi surface.
4. Within the antiferromagnetic metallic phase, there is a Fermi surface topology change from hole pockets centered around the Γ point at small values of the magnetization to one centered around the M point at larger values of the magnetization.
5. This Fermi surface topology change corresponds to two continuous Lifshitz transitions, where the volume of the hole pocket at the Γ point decreases at the expense of the increase of volume of the hole pocket at the M point.
6. The energy scales required to resolve the nature of this Fermi surface topology change are presently orders of magnitude smaller than accessible within the DCA with a quantum Monte Carlo solver.

1. The recent discovery of a resonance at 125 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) compatible with the Higgs particle represents a major step towards understanding the origin of the mass of fundamental particles. This discovery has implications for the role of mass in gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has non-minimal coupling to the general relativity sector.

2. The study of white dwarfs, which have both atomic and molecular features in their spectra, can be used to obtain upper bounds on the coupling between the Higgs field and the Kretschmann invariant, a specific curvature invariant. The analysis presented in the text provides upper bounds on this coupling that are quantitatively comparable to the ones assessed on the Higgs-Ricci coupling through measurements at the LHC, and represent an improvement of ten orders of magnitude compared to bounds from table-top experiments.

The source document discusses the discovery of pulsations in two new extremely low-mass, putatively helium-core white dwarfs (WDs), SDSS J161431.28+191219.4 (J1614) and SDSS J222859.93+362359.6 (J2228), which are the coolest pulsating WDs ever found. This brings the total number of known pulsating extremely low-mass WDs to five, establishing them as a new class of pulsating WDs.

2. The discovery of pulsations in J2228, which is considerably cooler than at least a half-dozen other photometrically constant extremely low-mass WDs, questions the purity of the instability strip for helium-core WDs and confuses the location of an empirical red edge. Unlike the co-core ZZ Ceti stars, which are believed to represent a stage in the evolution of all such WDs, extremely low-mass WDs may not all evolve through an instability strip in the same way, and thus their instability strip may not be pure.

1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into various distinct phases, including hot ionized gas, the warm neutral medium (WNM), and the cold neutral medium (CNM). Star formation is restricted to cold, dense gas, and the molecular gas content is a crucial tracer of star-forming regions.

2. Radiative shielding, particularly from dust and self-shielding, is crucial for the formation of significant amounts of molecular hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The dominant shielding mechanisms for H2 and CO differ, with H2 being primarily shielded by self-shielding, while CO is shielded by a combination of dust, self-shielding, and shielding by H2.

3. The authors compared several commonly used local approximations for radiative shielding to a more accurate ray-tracing approach, finding that the six-ray approximation, temperature-capped Jeans length, and power-law fit performed the best in matching the H2 and CO abundances of the fiducial model.

4. The authors note that the assumption of chemical equilibrium may overestimate the H2 fraction, particularly at low densities, and underestimate the CO fraction due to the lack of a time delay in the supernovae feedback prescription in the simulations. However, these limitations do not affect the primary objective of understanding the role of radiative shielding and numerical approximations to it in determining the chemical balance of the ISM.

1. The authors confirm the presence of a vertical extension of the red clump (VRC) in the color-magnitude diagrams of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), as previously reported by Zaritsky & Lin (1997). However, they argue that this feature is due to stellar evolution, not an intervening population of stars, based on several lines of evidence:

2. The position and relative density of the VRC are consistent with the blue loops experienced by intermediate-age, core helium-burning stars in the LMC, as predicted by stellar evolution models. The authors show that the VRC can be accounted for by the star formation history and initial mass function of the LMC, without the need for an additional foreground population.

3. The authors also identify a similar vertical extension in the color-magnitude diagram of nearby stars observed by the Hipparcos satellite, further supporting the stellar evolutionary origin of this feature rather than an intervening population.

1. The study uses data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to investigate the relationship between star formation and galaxy cluster properties in a sample of 69 low-redshift galaxy clusters.

2. The study finds that the fraction of star-forming galaxies and the mean specific star formation rate (MSSFR) of cluster galaxies increase with projected distance from the cluster center, but remain below the field values even at 3 times the cluster virial radius.

3. The suppressed star formation activity at large cluster radii is likely due to pre-processing of galaxies in intermediate-density environments, such as galaxy groups or filaments, before they are accreted into the cluster.

4. The study finds no significant correlation between the cluster-specific star formation rate (CSSFR) and cluster mass, suggesting that cluster mechanisms strongly dependent on mass, such as ram pressure or galaxy harassment, do not play a dominant role in regulating star formation in local galaxy clusters.

5. The results indicate that a mechanism less dependent on cluster mass, such as strangulation, may be the dominant process for quenching star formation in cluster galaxies.

6. The study demonstrates the power of using infrared data from WISE to study obscured star formation in galaxy clusters, providing a more complete view of the star formation activity compared to optical and UV surveys.

1. The analysis of modern accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments requires good control over the intermediate-energy neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section, particularly the importance of multi-nucleon events.
2. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data, leading to a growing interest in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by the neutrino collaborations.
3. One of the main problems in implementing the 2p-2h models is the high computational time due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states.
4. The frozen nucleon approximation is a fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model, reducing the number of nested integrals from 7 to 1.
5. The frozen approximation is validated by computing the 2p-2h response functions and comparing them with the exact calculation, with the presence of virtual delta excitations requiring the introduction of a ""frozen"" Delta-propagator.
6. The frozen approximation enables one to make 2p-2h calculations very efficiently and rapidly, instead of interpolating pre-calculated tables, and can be of great interest when implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo event generators.
7. The validity of the frozen approximation suggests that the detailed information about the momenta carried out by the two nucleons is lost in the inclusive responses for two-particle emission, as the energy and momentum transfer are shared by the two nucleons in multiple ways.
8. The frozen approximation is expected to be valid for other 2p-2h models, and the study will be extended to an exploration of how the 2p-2h meson-exchange current responses depend on nuclear species.

2. The reverberation mapping technique is used to estimate the mass of the SMBH by measuring the time lag between the variations in the continuum flux and the broad emission lines, which can be interpreted as the light travel time across the broad-line region (BLR).
3. The authors present the optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low-luminosity AGN, the X-ray source and Seyfert 1.5 galaxy H 0507+164, and estimate the mass of the SMBH using the reverberation mapping technique.
4. The authors find a time lag of 3.06 days between the variations in the H-beta emission line and the continuum flux at 5100 Angstroms, which corresponds to a BLR size of 0.67 parsec and a SMBH mass of 1.8 million solar masses.

1. The broad emission iron lines are well-known features found in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating close to the black hole by the reflection of the primary radiation on the accretion disc.
2. The spin of the black hole plays an important role in the formation of the line shape, as it determines the position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc.
3. The most widely used model for the relativistic disc spectral line is the Laor model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, but the KY models have relaxed this limitation and allowed the spin to be fitted.
4. The comparison of the Laor and KY models shows that the Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.
5. The study was conducted on two sources, MCG-6-30-15 (an active galaxy) and GX 339-4 (an X-ray binary), and the iron line is statistically better constrained for the active galaxy due to a significantly longer exposure time.
6. The KY model leads to a better-defined minimum of χ2 for the best-fit value and has a smoother adjustment between the different points in the parameter space, allowing for more reliable constraints on the spin.
7. The discrepancies between the Laor and KY results are within the general uncertainties of the spin determination using the skewed line profile when applied to the current data, but they are more visible for higher-quality data, such as those simulated for the XEUS mission.

2. The authors apply the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method to generate static disks made of a perfect fluid, i.e., with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, and disks of perfect fluid surrounded by a halo made of perfect fluid matter.

3. The authors present models of disks generated from different known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates, including the Schwarzschild, Buchdahl, and Narlikar-Patwardhan-Vaidya (NPV) solutions.

4. The generated disks have positive energy density and equal radial and azimuthal pressures, and the surface energy density and pressures decrease monotonically and rapidly with radius.

5. The authors find that as the ""cut"" parameter decreases, the disks become more relativistic, with surface energy density and pressure more concentrated near the center, and regions of unstable circular orbits are more likely to appear.

6. The tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion on the disk first increases with radius and then decreases as 1/r for large radii, except in the NPV 2a solution, where the sound velocity reaches its maximum value at the boundary.

7. The presented disks can be used to describe more realistic models of galaxies than most of the already studied disks, as the counter-rotation hypothesis is not needed to have a stable configuration.

2. The breakdown of an internal symmetry (gauge symmetry) leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory, while the breakdown of an external symmetry can provide physical explanations for certain phenomena.
3. The text focuses on the calculation of gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, using the method of dispersion relations, which provides an independent and complementary view to the ultraviolet regularization procedures.
4. The dispersion relation approach is shown to be equivalent to the n-dimensional regularization procedure, and the origin of the anomaly is attributed to the existence of a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of a specific formfactor.
5. The text also calculates the gravitational Schwinger terms, which occur in the equal-time commutators of the energy-momentum tensors, and demonstrates that they are determined by the same formfactor that exhibits the infrared feature of the anomalies.
6. The calculations are performed in two dimensions, where all the essential features of the dispersion relation approach are already present, and the method is expected to work in higher dimensions as well, although with more computational complexity.

1. The paper develops a geometrical method for classifying and visualizing homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in multi-scalar models with arbitrary scalar potentials. This involves two steps: first, the target space is augmented to a larger space with a Lorentzian metric, and flat cosmologies correspond to geodesics in this space; second, the target space is further enlarged to a ""doubly-augmented"" space, and non-flat cosmologies correspond to projections of geodesics in this space.

2. The paper provides a complete treatment of cosmological trajectories for exponential potentials, characterizing the fixed points and their stability. It also shows that exponential potentials serve as ""reference potentials"" for determining the asymptotic behavior of cosmologies in models with other potentials, such as inverse power potentials.

3. The interpretation of solutions of gravitational theories as geodesics in a suitable metric space has a considerable history, and the methods developed in this paper are related to the Maupertuis-Jacobi principle of classical mechanics. The geodesic interpretation can also be applied to models in which cosmological singularities correspond to horizons in the augmented target space.

2. The angular pattern of the longitudinal thermal conductivity in HTS shows a fourfold oscillation at low temperatures, which can be explained by the Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles.
3. As the temperature increases, the fourfold oscillation disappears, and the angular pattern changes, which can be attributed to the thermal activation of quasiparticles at different orientations from the nodal directions of the order parameter.
4. The experimental results can be well reproduced by a model involving Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the two-dimensional Boltzmann-Ritt-Tewordt (BRT) expression for the thermal conductivity, assuming a d-wave pairing symmetry. The small differences observed between twinned and untwinned samples can be explained by differences in impurity concentration and oxygen deficiency.

The paper presents three numerical methods, namely modified trigonometric cubic B-spline differential quadrature method (MTB-DQM), modified exponential cubic B-spline differential quadrature method (MEXP-DQM), and modified extended cubic B-spline differential quadrature method (MECDQ), to solve the initial value system of two-dimensional convection-diffusion equations with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

2. The proposed methods transform the convection-diffusion equation into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations, which are then solved using the SSP-RK54 scheme. The stability of the methods is analyzed using the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix.

3. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods are demonstrated through three test problems. The results show that the proposed solutions are more accurate compared to existing schemes and are in good agreement with the exact solutions.

4. The order of accuracy of the proposed methods for the convection-diffusion problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions is cubic when the grid size is sufficiently small, and otherwise, it is super-linear in space. For the convection-diffusion problem with Neumann boundary conditions, the order of accuracy is quadratic with respect to the L2 error norms.

1. The study presents a robust sample of 19 bright submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) selected using SCUBA and MAMBO in the Lockman Hole region, with the goal of understanding the true fraction of radio drop-outs amongst SMGs and the intrinsic positional uncertainty for SMGs without radio/IR counterparts.

2. The authors combined independent submillimeter and millimeter maps to construct a reliable catalogue, and determined 15 spectroscopic redshifts, of which 10 are considered secure. The resulting redshift distribution (median z = 2.14) is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that the bright SMG population is readily amenable to study via radio-selected samples.

3. The authors analyzed the separations between SMGs and their radio counterparts, allowing them to re-calibrate the relationship between positional accuracy, beam size, and significance. They found that the most secure SMGs, representative of those expected in upcoming wide-field surveys, will be located with an uncertainty of around 0.6 arcsec.

4. The authors note that the dual-wavelength extraction performed in this study could potentially bias the sample against very-high-redshift sources that would only be detected at 1.2 mm, and that reliable identification of such sources requires higher-resolution (interferometric) (sub)mm observations.

1. The authors present an analysis of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies in the Norris survey of the Corona Borealis supercluster, using data obtained from the Norris spectrograph on the Palomar 5-meter telescope.

2. The authors find that the local field galaxy LF has a normalization that is about 1.6 times higher than that of the Stromlo/APM survey, and they suggest that this discrepancy may be due to a systematic error in the bright magnitudes of the APM catalog.

3. The authors observe evolution in the LF of the blue, star-forming galaxy population, with these galaxies becoming more luminous at higher redshifts, but they do not find evidence for short-term bursts of star formation in these galaxies.

4. The LFs of the two superclusters studied (Corona Borealis and Abell 2069) show significant differences from the field galaxy LF, with an excess of very bright galaxies (M_R < -22) in the dense regions of the superclusters, and a possible steepening of the faint-end slope.

5. The authors conclude that the overall similarity between the supercluster and field galaxy LFs suggests that the fundamental physical processes driving galaxy formation and evolution do not depend strongly on environment, but the differences observed are likely due to environmental effects.

1. Rapidity gaps, i.e., pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA and Tevatron colliders.
2. These rapidity gaps are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, with the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state being the simplest model.
3. The authors demonstrate that the two-gluon exchange model violates partial wave unitarity and that a fully unitarized amplitude is needed for a quantitative understanding of the hard color singlet exchange process.
4. The color singlet exchange fraction is strongly affected by the full unitarization and deviates from the expectations of the two-gluon exchange approximation, with a strong dependence on the precise regularization procedure.
5. The authors find that the color singlet exchange fractions can be described in terms of a single universal phase, which absorbs all non-perturbative effects, and a gap survival probability.
6. The authors suggest a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data, using the gap survival probability and the universal phase, which should be performed directly by the experimental collaborations.
7. The limitations of the two-gluon exchange approximation may be generic to pomeron exchange models and should be analyzed more generally.

1. The paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model to forecast electric energy consumption in the Gaza Strip, which is the first of its kind in the existing literature.
2. The ANN model was developed using historical data from 1994 to 2013, including factors such as energy consumption, temperature, humidity, population, and GDP per capita, and was used to predict energy consumption for 2012 and 2013.
3. The performance of the ANN model was evaluated using various error criteria, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the results showed good accuracy.
4. The study employed 2-fold and k-fold cross-validation techniques to tackle problems in pattern recognition and model selection, with the test set used to evaluate the overall performance of the learning algorithm.

1. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are compact binaries where the primary is a compact object and the secondary is a low-mass star.
2. LMXBs can be divided into two groups: Z-sources and atoll sources, based on their X-ray properties.
3. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB that shows the properties of a Z-source, suggesting it has a neutron star primary and an accretion rate near the Eddington limit.
4. The authors obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy of LMCX-2 and detected narrow emission lines in the Bowen region, which are likely originating from the irradiated surface of the donor star.
5. The radial velocity curve of the HeII emission line suggests an orbital period of around 8 hours, consistent with previous photometric studies.
6. The authors also find evidence for a precessing, warped accretion disk in LMCX-2, which may explain the long-term variability observed in the system.
7. Using the detected Bowen emission lines, the authors were able to derive a lower limit on the mass function of LMCX-2, suggesting the compact object is likely a massive neutron star.
8. The authors were unable to tightly constrain the system parameters due to the complex nature of the system, but their analysis suggests LMCX-2 harbors a neutron star more massive than the canonical 1.4 solar masses.
9. Further long-term spectroscopic monitoring of LMCX-2 is needed to better understand the system's precession period and its impact on the observed properties.
10. The detection of the donor star's signature in LMCX-2 provides the first constraints on the system parameters of this important LMXB.

It demonstrates that the manifestation of the axial anomaly is connected to helicity-changing processes, where the outgoing lepton undergoes a helicity flip.

3. The authors introduce two new datasets, Bruce-A and Judd-A, which are more challenging than existing datasets and help reveal the limitations of current salient object detection models.
4. The authors find that current models often fail to segment the most salient object, which is the main reason for their poor performance on complex scenes.

6. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the properties of their datasets, including the complexity of scenes, the size and position of salient objects, and the types of objects present.
7. The authors demonstrate that their simple baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art salient object detection models on their new datasets, highlighting the need for more robust and scalable models.

1. The aim in physics is not only to calculate observables but to understand the physical picture responsible for the given phenomenon.
2. In crystals, the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, but to understand properties like electrical conductivity and heat capacity, we work with ""heavy electrons,"" phonons, and their interactions.
3. In QCD, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important phenomenon at the scale of 1 GeV, leading to the appearance of light pseudoscalar mesons and constituent quarks.
4. The coupling of constituent quarks with pseudoscalar and vector mesons produces a strong short-range spin-flavor interaction, while the net tensor and spin-orbit forces are weak.
5. The chiral interaction explains the reversal of the ordering of positive and negative parity states in the baryon spectrum, which cannot be solved with other types of hyperfine interactions.
6. The semirelativistic chiral constituent quark model provides a unified description of both nonstrange and strange baryon spectra in good agreement with phenomenology.
7. The short-range part of the chiral interaction, which is crucial for baryon spectroscopy, also induces a strong short-range repulsion in the NN system, explaining the necessary short-range repulsion.
8. The same short-range repulsion should persist in other baryon-baryon systems, with a different strength due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking.
9. The long- and intermediate-range attraction in the NN system is automatically implied by the Yukawa part of pion-exchange and correlated two-pion exchanges between quarks belonging to different nucleons.

2. The Postal Service commissioned a study by Aguirre International to assess the effectiveness of the Service's diversity program. The study found that women and minorities appeared to be experiencing problems advancing to management jobs at EAS 17 and above positions. The Service developed 23 initiatives in response to the Aguirre report to improve its diversity program.
3. The Postal Service collects a variety of diversity-related data, but it does not have reliable data on the flow of applicants through its promotion processes that would help it identify and remove any barriers to the promotion of women and minorities. The report recommends that the Postal Service ensure that appropriate EEO group data are captured and used to help improve the Service's diversity program.

2. In 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche program to meet budgetary constraints, which reduced funding and extended the development phase.
3. The Army's restructured program continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will perform as required and increases the risk of higher program costs.
4. The Comanche program faces significant challenges in software development, including problems with the Ada compilation system, delays in software development and testing, and issues with configuration management.
5. The Comanche's maintainability requirements, such as direct maintenance man-hours per flight hour, mean time to repair, and fault isolation, are at risk of not being achievable, which could affect the program's ability to achieve lower operating and support costs and wartime availability goals.
6. The Comanche's weight has increased, and if it exceeds a certain limit, the engine will need to be redesigned to meet the minimum vertical rate of climb requirement.
7. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense require the Army to complete operational testing to validate the Comanche's operational effectiveness and suitability before committing any funds to acquire long-lead production items or enter low-rate initial production.

It looks at when and how ICE officers and attorneys exercise discretion, the internal controls ICE has designed to guide officer decision-making, and the internal controls to oversee and monitor officer decision-making.

2. The report found that ICE officers and attorneys exercise discretion at various stages of the alien apprehension and removal process, particularly in the initial phases involving apprehension, charging, and detention. However, ICE's guidance on exercising discretion, especially for cases involving humanitarian issues or aliens who are not investigation targets, is not comprehensive.

3. The report found that while ICE has some internal controls in place, such as supervisory reviews and a new inspection program, it lacks a mechanism to analyze information on the exercise of discretion across field offices. This limits ICE's ability to identify trends, best practices, and areas needing corrective action.

4. The report recommends that ICE develop time frames for updating policies and guidance on exercising discretion, establish a mechanism to consistently provide officers with updates on legal developments, and evaluate the costs and alternatives of developing a reporting mechanism to analyze trends in the use of discretion.

4. Agencies and OMB do not have mechanisms in place to track the costs or workload associated with implementing IQA, but evidence suggests that addressing IQA requests and appeals can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly for substantive requests.

1. Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and channel them back to the economy.
2. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with more companies tapping the securities markets for their financial needs.
3. Securitization has led to a significant portion of home mortgages, consumer credit, and automobile loans being financed through securities instead of bank credit.
4. The growth of mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, with the amount of money in mutual funds rising by almost $1.2 trillion since 1989, while bank deposits declined.
5. The impact of mutual funds on deposits is difficult to quantify, but a reasonable estimate is that it was sizable, but probably less than $700 billion.
6. The movement of funds from deposits to mutual funds has not reduced the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy, as mutual funds have become a greater source of new finance than bank lending.
7. The availability of finance for different borrower sectors (residential, consumer, and business) may have been affected by the shift from deposits to mutual funds, but the extent of this impact is unclear.
8. Small businesses that are heavily dependent on small banks for credit may face reduced credit availability if their banks lose deposits to mutual funds.
9. However, small banks may be able to fund existing and new loans by selling securities from their investment accounts if faced with a loss of deposits.
10. Overall, the channels of financing are varied, and a shift of customers' money from deposits to mutual funds need not reduce credit availability for any group of borrowers.

1. The survey of the largest sponsors of defined-benefit (DB) pension plans reveals that they have made several revisions to their benefit offerings over the last 10 years, including modifying benefit formulas, converting some plans to hybrid plans, or freezing some of their plans.
2. The key reasons for these changes were the unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements for plans covering non-bargaining employees, and global or domestic competitive pressures for plans covering collectively bargained employees.
3. The survey also found that sponsors were more likely to convert DB plans covering non-bargaining unit employees to hybrid plans, citing trends in employee demographics as the top reason.
4. Regarding health benefits, the survey found that health care costs comprised the single largest benefit cost, representing 15% of base pay, and that 80% of respondents offered retiree health benefits to at least some future retirees, although 20% of respondents offered retiree health benefits that were fully paid by the retiree.
5. The survey found that 46% of respondents reported that retiree health care was no longer to be offered to employees hired after a certain date, and that 54% of respondents had decreased or eliminated the firm's share of the cost of providing health benefits for future retirees who were non-bargaining employees.
6. The survey also found that the majority of respondents were not planning to make significant changes to their benefit offerings, and that most respondents did not believe there were conditions under which they would consider forming a new DB plan.

1. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 established the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to provide government-guaranteed flood insurance and reduce the federal government's costs for repairing flood damage.
2. NFIP currently offers subsidized and full-risk premium rates, but many rates do not reflect the full risk of flooding, exposing taxpayers to potential losses. Increasing premium rates to fully reflect risk could reduce costs to taxpayers but may decrease participation.
3. NFIP has limited ability to pay claims during catastrophic loss years, often requiring borrowing from the Treasury, which further burdens taxpayers. Increasing mitigation efforts could help reduce flood damage and NFIP's financial exposure.
4. Expanding NFIP participation, particularly in low-risk areas, could help diversify the risk pool and lower rates, but would require careful implementation to avoid concentrating high-risk properties in the program.
5. Encouraging private market participation in flood insurance could transfer some of the federal government's risk exposure, but may also lead to higher rates and affordability concerns for low-income policyholders.

2. The Single Audit Act established the concept of a single audit to replace multiple grant audits, with the objectives of promoting sound financial management, establishing uniform audit requirements, and ensuring federal agencies rely on audit work done under the act.
3. The 1996 amendments to the act extended the law to cover all recipients of federal financial assistance, increased the audit threshold, and established a Federal Audit Clearinghouse as the single audit repository.
4. The quality of single audits has been a longstanding concern, with GAO and federal Inspectors General identifying issues such as insufficient evidence, lack of compliance testing, and auditors' lack of understanding of the audit requirements.
5. A 2007 study by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) found that approximately 51% of single audits had deficiencies severe enough to be classified as having limited reliability or being unacceptable.

2. The study suggests that the ""inherent frailty"" hypothesis does not accurately describe the injury experience of women drivers, as their relative injury risk compared to men drivers varies based on crash type, automobile size, and safety belt use. In contrast, the relative injury risk of older drivers compared to younger drivers is largely unaffected by these factors.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) launched the Corporate Information Management (CIM) initiative in 1989 to improve business practices, make better use of information technology, and eliminate duplicative information systems across various administrative areas. The CIM initiative aimed to reengineer DOD's business processes before standardizing its information systems.

2. However, DOD shifted the CIM implementation emphasis back to information systems, focusing on selecting and implementing migration systems to achieve quick cost savings. This strategy faced several impediments, including a lack of acceptance from functional and technical managers, a lack of integration among various CIM efforts, and unclear program management authority. To address these issues, the report recommends that DOD revise its CIM management strategy, train employees, and consider renaming the initiative to promote understanding and acceptance.

2. The GAO investigators produced counterfeit NRC documents and a bill of lading for a fictitious company to support their possession of radioactive sources.
3. The investigators transported an amount of radioactive sources sufficient to manufacture a dirty bomb during their border crossings, both at the northern and southern borders.
4. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors did not question the validity of the counterfeit documents and allowed the investigators to enter the United States.
5. The GAO briefed the CBP and NRC officials about the results of their undercover operations, and the CBP agreed to work with the NRC to verify the authenticity of NRC materials documents.
6. The NRC officials disagreed with the GAO's assessment of the amount of radioactive material needed to produce a dirty bomb, but the GAO believes that the issues of counterfeiting documents and the ability to purchase radioactive sources should be addressed by the NRC.
7. The GAO could have purchased all the radioactive sources used in their undercover operations by making multiple purchases from different suppliers, using false identities and cover stories, and having the sources shipped to the nation's capital.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) has historically faced challenges in transitioning new technologies from research labs and test facilities into real-world military applications.
2. To address this issue, DOD has established several ""technology transition"" programs, including the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT), and more recent initiatives like the Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and Quick Reaction Fund.
3. The report found that the three newer programs (TTI, DACP, and Quick Reaction Fund) have had varying degrees of success in selecting, managing, and overseeing technology transition projects, with the DACP being the most disciplined and the Quick Reaction Fund being the least formal.
4. The report recommends that DOD develop better performance measures and feedback mechanisms to assess the impact and return on investment of these technology transition programs, as well as implement formal agreements and technology readiness level assessments to improve the selection and management of projects.
5. The report also recommends that DOD identify ways to improve communication and collaboration between technology developers, program managers, and acquisition personnel to better identify and resolve issues that could hinder successful technology transition.

2. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take 452 actions to meet the objectives of Titles I, III, and IV, which address national ambient air quality standards, hazardous air pollutants, and acid deposition control, respectively.
3. EPA met most of the required actions, but a large portion of them were completed late, with an average delay of 15 to 25 months past the statutory deadlines.
4. Factors contributing to the delays included an emphasis on stakeholder involvement, the need to set priorities among the numerous new requirements, and competing demands from lawsuits challenging some of EPA's rules.
5. As of April 2005, 45 of the requirements with statutory deadlines had not been met, primarily related to regulations for consumer and commercial products, residual risk reviews for hazardous air pollutants, and a few actions under the acid deposition control program.

2. The Federal Reserve derives income primarily from the interest on its holdings of U.S. government securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt, and uses earnings to pay operational expenses, dividends to member banks, and to fund their capital surplus accounts.
3. The Federal Reserve Act required member banks to purchase stock in their regional Reserve Bank equal to 6 percent of their capital and surplus, with 3 percent paid-in and 3 percent on call by the Reserve Bank, and provided for a 6 percent dividend rate on the paid-in capital.
4. The FAST Act modified the Reserve Bank stock dividend rate for large member banks from 6 percent to a rate pegged at the lesser of 6 percent or the 10-year Treasury rate, which has had no immediate effect on Federal Reserve membership.
5. Modifying the Reserve Bank stock ownership requirement could have wide-ranging policy implications on the structure of the Federal Reserve, including potential effects on Reserve Bank autonomy, Federal Reserve financial independence, and the ability to conduct Reserve Bank operations.

2. In 2014, 30% of all tax filers chose to itemize their deductions, with higher-income individuals itemizing more often than lower-income individuals. The majority of itemizers (56.2%) had incomes less than $100,000, but higher-income itemizers claimed a larger share of the total itemized deductions.
3. Tax filers in higher-income ranges claimed deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes at higher rates than tax filers in lower-income ranges. The mortgage interest deduction was the largest single deduction for tax filers with an AGI less than $500,000, while the deduction for state and local income taxes was the largest for tax filers with an AGI greater than $500,000.

1. The appropriate taxation of capital gains income has been a topic of debate in Congress since the enactment of the individual income tax in 1913. The current tax system has an asymmetrical treatment of capital gains and losses, allowing taxpayers to time their gains and losses to minimize income taxes.

2. Historically, Congress has made various changes to the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, attempting to reestablish symmetry between the two. However, under current law, asymmetries remain, with net long-term losses being deductible against net short-term gains without limit, and net long-term losses being deductible against up to $3,000 of ordinary income.

3. The empirical evidence suggests that capital gains and losses are heavily concentrated among higher-income taxpayers, and that increasing the net capital loss deduction would primarily benefit these taxpayers. Additionally, it is unclear whether increasing the net loss deduction would effectively stimulate the economy.

4. To achieve full symmetry in the tax treatment of capital gains and losses, the report suggests either adjusting the netting process to account for the rate differential between short-term and long-term gains and losses, or instituting a tax credit for capital losses, similar to the approach taken between 1924 and 1938.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) provides an alternative tax calculation on a broader tax base than the regular tax.
2. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, leading to an increase in the number of taxpayers covered by the AMT over time.
3. The AMT is shifting from affecting primarily high-income individuals to reaching further down into the middle and upper-middle income classes.
4. The cost of correcting the AMT, such as indexing the exemptions or eliminating the credit limit provision, is significant and will continue to grow.
5. Tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities without also altering the AMT will increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit.
6. The interaction between the AMT and tax cuts, such as the marriage penalty relief, can significantly reduce the intended benefits of the tax cuts.
7. There are different views on the role of the AMT, with some seeing it as a desirable alternative tax and others wanting to see it eliminated or significantly reformed.
8. Adjustments to the AMT, such as indexing the exemptions or conforming changes to the AMT as the regular tax structure changes, are complex and not always clear-cut.
9. The growth in the AMT has been considered a potential problem, and its importance increases with tax cuts, as not all taxpayers receive the full amount or any of the tax cut.

Dairy farmers and their supporters have advocated for stricter import controls on these products, arguing that it would raise milk prices for dairy farmers.
2. Legislation has been proposed to establish tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on imports of MPCs and casein/caseinates, which would impose higher tariffs on imports above the quota levels. This move would likely require the United States to enter into compensation negotiations with major supplier countries under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.

3. HRPs generally enroll a small percentage of the uninsured population, reflecting their narrow focus on individuals with pre-existing conditions who do not have access to public or group health insurance.
4. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) required the establishment of a temporary high risk pool program prior to 2014 to provide coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions who have been uninsured for at least six months.
5. HRPs fill a niche in the health insurance system, providing coverage for individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance or public programs and cannot obtain affordable coverage in the individual market due to medical underwriting.
6. State HRPs are operated through state-established nonprofit organizations, with private insurance companies responsible for administrative duties and the pools bearing the insurance risk.
7. HRPs are generally underfunded and experience losses, leading to high premiums and cost-sharing requirements that can make the coverage unaffordable for many individuals.

1. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides for an expedited removal process that allows the government to summarily remove certain aliens without a hearing or further review, with limited exceptions. This process was initially limited to ""arriving aliens"" seeking entry into the United States, but has been gradually expanded over time to cover additional categories of aliens.

2. The government has the statutory authority to further expand the use of expedited removal to cover aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, if they have been in the country less than two years. However, extending expedited removal to aliens in the interior of the United States could raise constitutional concerns regarding due process protections for aliens who have entered the country, even unlawfully.

1. The legal framework for congressional redistricting involves constitutional and federal statutory requirements, as well as case law interpretations. The Supreme Court has ruled that congressional districts must be drawn with approximate population equality, and that the creation of majority-minority districts may be required under the Voting Rights Act to avoid racial vote dilution.

2. The Supreme Court has addressed several issues related to congressional redistricting, including the extent to which precise population equality is required, whether partisanship can justify differences in population, and who should be counted for the purposes of achieving equality among districts. The Court has also clarified the limits the Fourteenth Amendment places on the use of race in the redistricting process.

3. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of independent redistricting commissions established by ballot initiatives, ruling that the Elections Clause of the Constitution permits states to delegate the congressional redistricting process to such commissions. Additionally, Congress has considered several bills that would establish additional statutory requirements and standards for congressional redistricting.

2. Mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees has been recommended by recent deficit reduction groups, as it is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds.
3. Mandatory Social Security coverage could simplify retirement planning, prevent gaps in pension or Social Security coverage, and provide better benefit protections for workers and their families through dependents' and survivors' benefits, as well as full cost-of-living adjustments.
4. Opponents argue that mandatory Social Security coverage may not necessarily result in better benefit protections, as state and local governments could reduce pension benefits to keep overall costs down, and higher-wage workers may receive lower replacement rates under Social Security.
5. Mandatory Social Security coverage could affect state and local government pension plans, leading to changes in benefit structures or the creation of new pension plans for newly hired employees.

1. The study compared the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) procedures.
2. The results showed a significantly lower rate of secondary, delayed hemorrhage in the SMUPPP group (1.45%) compared to the tonsillectomy group (5.05%).
3. The authors suggest that the suturing technique used in SMUPPP, which approximates the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa, may have contributed to the decreased incidence of postoperative bleeding.
4. The study recommends the routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.

1. The study investigated the expression levels of miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-206, miR-145, miR-21, and miR-10b) in breast cancer tissues and their relationship with clinical pathological features. The results showed that miR-125a, miR-206, and miR-145 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, while miR-21 and miR-10b were upregulated.
2. The study suggests that these miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. miR-145 and miR-206 were found to be associated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, indicating their potential as targets for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, miR-21 and miR-125a were linked to HER2-positive breast cancer and could contribute to the development of new anti-HER2 drugs and overcoming resistance to trastuzumab.

1. The study found that tissue transglutaminase (tgm2) mRNA and protein are overexpressed by mononuclear leukocytes, predominantly activated monocytes, that accumulate in the vascular bed of rat renal allografts during acute rejection. This suggests that tgm2 expression by graft monocytes may be linked to apoptosis and could contribute to the reversion of acute rejection.

2. The study also investigated the role of tgm2 in the pathogenesis of chronic allograft injury (CAI) by treating allograft recipients with the transglutaminase inhibitor cystamine, but did not find a significant effect on renal function or graft remodeling within the 84-day study period. The authors suggest that further investigation is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of tgm2 inhibition on CAI development.

3. EMPs were introduced into a model patient's IV bag and circulated through a continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) circuit.
4. The perfusate was circulated through the CVVH filter, and EMP levels were measured at regular intervals.
5. The decline in EMP levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes.
6. Within 40 minutes, the circulating EMP levels were reduced to 29% of the starting concentration.
7. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.
8. The study demonstrates that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter can remove EMPs from a modeled patient's circulation.

1. This study evaluated the effect of a sublingual nitroglycerin spray on time to onset of angina, time to development of moderate angina, and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression during exercise in patients with chronic stable angina. The results showed a dose-dependent increase in these parameters compared to placebo, with the most pronounced effect seen with the 1.6 mg dose.

2. Sublingual nitroglycerin spray was generally well-tolerated, with an increase in treatment-related adverse events observed at higher dose levels. The study suggests that prophylactic use of sublingual nitroglycerin spray may allow patients to exercise for a longer duration before the onset of angina, which could be clinically relevant for improving daily physical activity and quality of life.

3. The study highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy, including the use of sublingual nitroglycerin, in the management of stable angina. Current guidelines recommend the initial use of medical therapy, which has been shown to be as effective as revascularization in reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in many patients with stable angina.

3. Several studies have investigated the potential mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of the long-acting insulin analogue, glargine, on cancer cells, but the clinical implications remain controversial.
4. Multiple studies have been conducted to assess the association between glargine and cancer risk, with mixed results. Some studies found an increased risk, while others did not.
5. The studies have raised concerns about the long-term effects of diabetes, insulin treatment, and specifically glargine, on cancer development, but the overall benefit-to-risk ratio of good glycemic control is likely to support the extensive use of insulin.

2. Various nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanocones, and biomimetic nanostructures, have been proposed to further reduce light reflectivity and improve solar cell efficiency.
3. ZnO nanostructures have been widely used as antireflective layers due to their wide bandgap and suitability for photovoltaic applications.
4. The authors have grown ZnO nanowhiskers (NWs) with different lengths using a seeding and growth two-step process and integrated them into the fabrication of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells.
5. The density and length of ZnO NWs were optimized to improve the solar cell performance, and a 3% relative improvement in efficiency was achieved using ZnO NWs as the AR layer.
6. The ZnO NWs effectively reduced the reflectivity of the solar cells, especially in the long-wavelength range, through light trapping and a gradually changing refractive index profile.
7. The solar cells with ZnO NWs grown for 30 and 45 minutes showed higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and short-circuit current densities compared to the reference cell.
8. The efficiency improvement was attributed to the reduction in reflectivity and the enhancement in the light spectrum response.
9. However, prolonged growth time (60 minutes) of ZnO NWs led to a deterioration in the solar cell performance due to stronger light absorption by the long NWs.
10. The work demonstrates the potential of ZnO nanostructures as an effective antireflective layer for improving the efficiency of silicon solar cells.

1. The study investigated the effects of a high-fat diet and ovariectomy on inflammatory processes in rats.
2. A high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy led to increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content, as well as hyperleptinemia.
3. The high-fat diet caused a decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in mesenteric adipose tissues, but this effect was reversed by ovariectomy.
4. Ovariectomy combined with a high-fat diet decreased the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) content in mesenteric adipose tissues and the IL-6 content in retroperitoneal adipose tissues.
5. The study suggests that after menopause, women should decrease their consumption of high-fat diets to prevent the induction of proinflammatory processes.

1. Hemoptysis is a common symptom in respiratory diseases, and massive hemoptysis has a high mortality rate.
2. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is a safe and effective treatment for massive, chronic, or recurrent hemoptysis.
3. This retrospective study analyzed the outcomes of 344 patients who underwent BAE between 2006 and 2013.
4. The study found that the immediate control of bleeding was achieved in 96% of patients, and the main responsible arteries for bleeding were the right bronchial artery, left bronchial artery, and combined right and left bronchial trunk.
5. Recurrent bleeding occurred in 17.7% of patients within 30 days and 21.5% of patients after 1 month, with the main causes being cancer, tuberculosis, and severe bronchiectasis.
6. Common complications of BAE included fever, chest pain, and shoulder pain, but fewer patients experienced neurological sequelae.
7. The long-term follow-up revealed that 28 patients had died, with 6 deaths due to massive hemorrhage, and 21 patients had recurrent hemoptysis with a low volume of bleeding.
8. BAE is a relatively safe and effective method for controlling hemoptysis, and it can be used repeatedly, especially for patients who are poor surgical candidates.
9. The study found that more than 50% of patients had massive hemoptysis, and 41% of patients had hemorrhage sources from both lungs.
10. Medical management and surgery are also important in the treatment of hemoptysis, but BAE represents the first-line treatment for hemoptysis arising from the bronchial arterial source.

1. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) can both cause lymphocytic gastritis (LG), a condition characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the gastric mucosa.
2. The study aimed to define the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa in pediatric patients with LG due to CD and HP infection.
3. The highest prevalence of LG was found in CD patients with HP infection, followed by CD patients without HP infection, HP-positive patients without CD, and normal controls.
4. CD patients, with or without HP infection, showed a significant increase in CD3+ and CD8+ IELs compared to controls, while HP infection alone did not contribute to the increase in CD8+ IELs.
5. The number of lymphoid aggregates in the gastric mucosa was highest in HP-infected patients, regardless of CD status.
6. The study suggests that in young patients with suspected atypical CD, the number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum may help differentiate between CD and HP infection, while the number of lymphoid follicles may indicate HP infection.
7. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD8+ lymphocytes in the antrum should be included in the evaluation of undefined cases of CD.

1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is required for the growth of solid tumors. Inhibition of angiogenesis, particularly by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, has emerged as an important strategy in cancer treatment. Anti-VEGF therapies, such as bevacizumab, 2C3, and R84, have been shown to effectively reduce tumor size, microvessel density, and macrophage infiltration in preclinical models of breast cancer.

2. The effects of anti-VEGF therapies extend beyond the inhibition of angiogenesis, as VEGF is also a potent chemoattractant for various immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and dendritic cells. Inhibition of VEGF signaling has been shown to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment, leading to changes in intratumoral cytokine levels and immune cell infiltration, which may contribute to the anti-tumor effects of these therapies.

2. The study evaluated lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of PAD patients before and after surgical treatment, as well as in a group of patients receiving simvastatin therapy. The results showed that PAD patients had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and a decrease in total antioxidant capacity after surgery.
3. Simvastatin therapy was found to have beneficial effects on lipid peroxidation, with lower MDA concentrations compared to the PAD patients before surgery. However, simvastatin did not significantly influence the total antioxidant potential, which may be due to a dose-dependent effect.

2. Müller cells, the major type of glial cells in the retina, play an important role in retinal function and are involved in multiple retinal diseases, including glaucoma.
3. Reactive Müller cells can release cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which contributes to neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
4. The study used a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) to investigate the effects of α-aminoadipic acid (AAA), a compound that induces glial toxicity, on Müller cell gliosis and retinal abnormalities.
5. AAA treatment attenuated Müller cell gliosis, as indicated by reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity, and decreased TNF-α levels in the AOH model.
6. AAA treatment significantly rescued RGCs from apoptosis and reduced the loss of RGCs in the AOH model.
7. The findings suggest that AAA promoted the survival of RGCs in the AOH model by inhibiting Müller cell gliosis and downregulating TNF-α production.
8. The study indicates that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.

The study describes a new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L) for the treatment of non-ampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms (SDNs). This technique involves ligating the tumor, including the seromuscular layer, using a ligation device, followed by endoscopic resection of the targeted lesion under the ligation band.
2. The authors report the successful resection of non-ampullary SDNs in 5 consecutive patients using the LAEFTR-L technique, which they claim has several advantages over conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) procedures, including the ability to retrieve the resected specimen intraluminally, avoiding contact with the peritoneum and reducing the risk of peritoneal tumor dissemination. The authors suggest that LAEFTR-L may be a promising technique for the treatment of non-ampullary SDNs, but further prospective studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy and safety.

2. The management of CAH involves oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. However, patients with CAH may develop adrenal masses, and chronic poor compliance to therapy appears to be associated with the development of these tumors. Therefore, patients with CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumors, improve symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorders.

2. The Dx/HA injection technique has gained popularity due to its ease of use, short procedure time, and fast recovery, as well as the ability to repeat the procedure.
3. The initial success rate of Dx/HA injection was reported as 68%, but the worldwide success rates vary considerably, ranging from 55% to 89%.
4. The authors compared two different positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography techniques to detect de novo contralateral VUR and to predict the success of Dx/HA injection.
5. The study found that 27 out of 34 patients with preoperative unilateral VUR had positive PIC cystography, indicating de novo contralateral VUR, and were successfully treated with bilateral Dx/HA injection.
6. However, the overall success rate of Dx/HA injection was 75% for patients and 80% for renal units, and a negative intraoperative cystogram correlated with the postoperative voiding cystogram in only 80% of cases.
7. The authors suggest that the lower success rate of Dx/HA injection compared to open surgery is a concern, and the development of a method to check the success of the procedure intraoperatively would be highly desirable.
8. PIC cystography was not found to be useful in improving the success rate of Dx/HA injection, as a negative intraoperative cystogram did not always correlate with a successful postoperative outcome.
9. The authors conclude that the addition of intraoperative cystograms cannot replace postoperative studies, and in patients with unilateral VUR, PIC cystography can detect occult reflux and prevent postoperative contralateral new-onset VUR.

3. Removing the smear layer is necessary for the penetration of the adhesive system and resin cement into the dentin tubules, and various chemical substances and laser systems can be used for this purpose.
4. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the photodynamic diode laser and other smear layer removal methods on the bond strength of self-adhesive cement.

3. The flexural stiffness of MyoVa and its subdomains, such as the lever arms and rod domain, was measured using tethered particle microscopy (TPM).
4. The lever arms of MyoVa are critical for its processive movement, and their flexural stiffness can be tuned by calcium signaling.
5. The addition of calcium leads to a decrease in the lever arm's flexural stiffness, which may negatively impact the motor's processivity.
6. The distal rod segment of MyoVa has a flexural stiffness lower than the lever arms, suggesting a highly compliant structure.
7. The compliance of the lever arm/rod junction is believed to contribute to MyoVa's ability to maneuver through actin-actin intersections and switch tracks on actin bundles.

1. The study evaluated the performance of three different-sized superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-based formulations as magnetic tracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in a porcine model.
2. The 59 nm tracer demonstrated the most favorable characteristics, including rapid uptake allowing transcutaneous hotspot detection within 30 minutes, retention in the first nodes reached, and high accumulation in the sentinel lymph nodes.
3. The 32 nm tracer showed poor retention, with the particles passing through the sentinel lymph nodes to higher echelon nodes, leading to the excision of an excessive number of normal nodes.
4. The 111 nm tracer showed slower uptake, with transcutaneous hotspot detection taking up to 240 minutes, and the particles were predominantly confined within macrophages in the sentinel lymph nodes.
5. The study concluded that the 59 nm tracer is the best-performing magnetic nanoparticle tracer approved for human use in SLNB with a handheld magnetometer.

1. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine proteinase inhibitor (vaspin) was identified in the visceral adipose tissue of OLETF rats, an animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
2. Circulating levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced predominantly by adipocytes, are inversely associated with T2DM and other metabolic traits.
3. The study measured serum vaspin and adiponectin levels in subjects with normal renal function and renal insufficiency with or without T2DM.
4. The serum vaspin levels were lower in patients with T2DM compared to individuals without T2DM, but there was no significant difference in serum vaspin levels between subjects with and without renal insufficiency.
5. The serum adiponectin levels were higher in individuals with renal insufficiency compared to those without, regardless of the presence of T2DM.
6. Serum vaspin levels were associated with various clinical parameters, such as creatinine, age, systolic blood pressure, and uric acid, in subjects with and without T2DM.
7. Serum adiponectin levels were associated with parameters like age, systolic blood pressure, creatinine clearance, and hemoglobin A1c in all subjects.
8. The serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were both higher in women than in men, whether in total subjects or in patients with T2DM.

1. The study used data from two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing.
2. The study included 190 DFUs from the clinical trials and an additional 1,440 DFUs from an active postmarketing surveillance.
3. The study evaluated several surrogate variables, including percent change in area, log healing rate, ratio of log areas, and percent of granulation tissue covering the ulcer area.
4. The results showed that the percent of granulation tissue covering the ulcer area had the highest predictive value for complete healing, with 79.5% correct classification and a high negative predictive value.
5. The proportion mediated analysis suggested that the effect of the treatment on complete healing was almost entirely mediated by the formation of granulation tissue.
6. The study found that the predictive property of percent area change, log healing rate, and ratio of log area could be extrapolated to more complicated, ischemic, larger, and higher Wagner grade DFUs, but the cutoff points for classification were different.
7. The study could not validate the surrogate property for the variables based on area change due to the lack of fulfillment of the Prentice criteria.
8. The study provides the first evidence for the use of granulation tissue development as a predictor of wound healing in advanced DFUs, which can be useful for clinical trial design and healthcare programs managing DFUs.
9. The measurement of the proportion of wound area covered by granulation tissue is part of routine clinical care, making the surrogate markers easily applicable by clinicians.
10. The study had limitations, including the small sample size and the inability to validate the surrogate property for the variables based on area change in the confirmatory, postmarketing series.

1. The study compared the perioperative surgical trauma and postoperative impact on the abdominal wall between needlescopic transabdominal preperitoneal (NTAPP) and single-incision transabdominal preperitoneal (STAPP) laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.
2. The NTAPP procedure had a smaller umbilical skin incision, shorter operative time, and reduced immediate postoperative wound pain and sick leave compared to the STAPP procedure.
3. Both procedures had similar long-term outcomes in terms of hernia recurrence, abdominal wall mobility, and cosmetic satisfaction.
4. The authors suggest that the NTAPP procedure can further minimize surgical trauma to the abdominal wall while providing distinct advantages in the immediate postoperative phase, but randomized controlled trials are still needed to validate the benefits of needlescopic surgery.

1. The breathing process is essential for human survival, and when breathing through the mouth, it can lead to pathological adaptations in the structures of the stomatognathic system, especially in childhood.
2. Nasopharyngoscopy is considered the gold standard exam for assessing the nasopharynx, as it provides a dynamic and three-dimensional view of the pharyngeal tonsils and their relation to other structures. In contrast, cephalometry tends to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsils compared to nasopharyngoscopy.
3. The study found a regular and positive correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, but cephalometry had a low sensitivity and a high negative predictive value, suggesting that it may not provide an accurate assessment of the nasopharynx.
4. The authors recommend that patients with mouth-breathing symptoms and normal radiographic exams should undergo a complementary assessment with nasopharyngoscopy, as it is associated with greater diagnostic accuracy due to its three-dimensional and dynamic nature.

1. Ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in patients with breast cancer can be classified as either a true local recurrence (TR) or a new primary tumor (NPT), which have different clinical relevance, prognosis, and therapeutic management. Distinguishing between TR and NPT is important and can be done by studying the location, staging, and histological subtype of the new tumor.

2. Patients with NPT are generally younger at initial diagnosis and have a more favorable prognosis compared to those with TR. Salvage mastectomy is the standard treatment for IBTR, but there is no conclusive evidence of its superiority over conservative surgery. The optimal systemic therapy for IBTR is also unknown, but patients with TR may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant treatment, while those with NPT may be treated similarly to patients with de novo breast cancer.

3. Due to declining mortality rates and the increasing number of breast cancer survivors, understanding relapse patterns and establishing appropriate follow-up and screening tests are important for the care of breast cancer survivors. Genetic predisposition and the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer should also be considered in the management of patients with NPT.

2. The study evaluated the entire aorta diameter, from the thoracic aorta to the abdomen aorta, using non-contrast CT scans in a population with multiple risk factors for both coronary heart disease (CHD) and AA.
3. The prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) was considerably high (36.5%) and was associated with various clinical factors, including older age, larger body surface area, and higher diastolic blood pressure, while TAA was not associated with dyslipidemia.
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was independently associated with the presence of dyslipidemia, current/past smoking, and the presence of TAA.
5. The prevalence of AAA was low (6.0%) compared to previous studies, and none of the non-smokers had a large AAA (> 40 mm), suggesting that race influences AAA prevalence and that Asians generally have a low prevalence of AAA.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with the highest incidence rates in Europe and North America. Mammography, including digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), has been the primary method for breast cancer detection, with DM being more widely adopted in the U.S.

2. DBT, a 3D imaging technique, has shown promise in addressing some of the limitations of conventional 2D mammography, such as improved cancer detection, fewer false positives, and lower recall rates. However, the combined radiation dose of DM and DBT is higher than mammography alone, and radiologist interpretation time is longer.

3. Ongoing research and clinical trials are evaluating the performance of DBT in large population screenings, as well as the integration of DBT with other imaging modalities, such as contrast-enhanced mammography and automated breast ultrasound, to further improve breast cancer detection and characterization, particularly in women with dense breast tissue.

1. The global population, especially in developed countries, is getting older, and this trend is predicted to continue in the coming decades.
2. Aging is an important independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, which is manifested as endothelial dysfunction. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreased responsiveness to other endothelial-derived vasodilators promote a vasoconstrictive, hypercoagulative, and proliferative state, which favors the development of atherosclerosis.
3. Vascular oxidative stress, the product of increased reactive oxygen species and reduced antioxidant defense, and chronic inflammation perpetuate a vicious cycle of endothelial dysfunction.
4. Exercise training prevents and restores age-related impairment of endothelial function, possibly by the restoration of NO availability consequent to the prevention of oxidative stress and the alleviation of inflammatory processes.
5. Exercise-induced production of reactive oxygen species is proposed to evoke specific adaptations, such as increasing repair mechanisms for oxidative damage, increasing resistance to oxidative stress, and lowering levels of oxidative damage.
6. Exercise also produces a short-term inflammatory response followed by a long-term anti-inflammatory adaptive response, which contributes to the natural protective effects of physical activity.

1. Axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and prognosis worsens with increasing number of metastatic lymph nodes.
2. The ratio of the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the number of removed lymph nodes, known as the lymph node ratio (LNR), provides more useful prognostic information compared to the number of metastatic lymph nodes.
3. In patients with 1-3 metastatic axillary lymph nodes, the study found that disease-free survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were significantly worse in patients with 1-5 lymph nodes removed compared to those with 6 or more lymph nodes removed.
4. The most significant LNR threshold values for separating patients into low- and high-risk groups were 0.20 for DFS, 0.30 for LRFS, and 0.15 for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).
5. LNR was a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes, and it could be used to separate patients with 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes into low- and high-risk groups for distant metastasis development.
6. In patients with at least 10 lymph nodes removed, the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR did not have prognostic significance for LRFS, suggesting that in N1 disease, removal of at least 10 lymph nodes may be sufficient for locoregional control.
7. LNR can be a useful tool to standardize adjuvant therapy and draw reliable comparisons between treatment results from different hospitals, as it is less dependent on the extent of axillary dissection.

The study evaluated the use of various acid phosphatases, including PhonSF, PhonSE, and PiACP, for the selective phosphorylation of primary and secondary alcohols using inorganic di-, tri-, and polyphosphates as phosphate donors. The enzymes demonstrated absolute chemoselectivity for O-nucleophiles over N- and S-nucleophiles, and high regioselectivity for primary over secondary hydroxy groups.
2. The thermodynamically favored hydrolysis of the phosphate esters was minimized by controlling reaction parameters such as pH and phosphate donor type, allowing the use of phosphatases in synthetic applications. The process was scaled up by immobilizing the PhonSF enzyme on a resin and using a continuous flow reactor, yielding 6.86 g (41% yield) of 4-hydroxybutyl phosphate.

1. The field of invasion biology has gained significant attention since the 1980s, with research revealing the widespread and varied impacts of non-native invasive species on ecosystems, including effects on nutrient cycles, hydrology, and the evolution of native species.
2. While some critics argue that the problems caused by invasive species are overblown or that introduced species can increase biodiversity, the evidence suggests that the impacts of non-native species are often more severe and widespread than those of native species, and that many complete species extinctions have been caused by introduced species.
3. Attempts to identify potentially invasive species and prevent their introduction have had some success, and technologies for early detection, rapid response, and management of established invasive populations have improved, demonstrating that it is not futile to combat biological invasions.
4. The call for abandoning traditional restoration ecology in favor of ""novel ecosystems"" is based on the premise that invasions and climate change have rendered the restoration of historical ecosystems impossible, but this premise is flawed, as modern restoration ecology does not aim to recreate the past but to re-establish the historical trajectory of an ecosystem.
5. Critics of invasion biology and restoration ecology can influence policy by creating the perception of scientific controversy, even though they represent a minority view, and this can delay the implementation of prevention and mitigation measures for harmful environmental impacts.
6. Overall, the scientific evidence supports the continued development and application of invasion biology and restoration ecology as important tools for addressing the global environmental challenges posed by biological invasions and other anthropogenic impacts.

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a relatively common disorder characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels.
2. SCH is associated with various adverse health outcomes, including increased body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
3. The relationship between SCH and cardiovascular outcomes remains controversial, with some studies showing an increased risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and mortality, while others have not found such associations.
4. Replacement therapy with levothyroxine (T4) has shown some benefits in improving lipid profiles, endothelial function, and cardiac function in individuals with SCH, but the overall impact on clinical outcomes is still unclear.
5. The European Commission has funded a large, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial (the TRUST study) to definitively assess the effects of T4 replacement on clinical outcomes in older adults with persistent SCH, which will help guide future clinical recommendations.

1. Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and its diagnosis is based on the detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA).
2. EIA has low sensitivity for detecting C. difficile toxins compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cytotoxigenic culture, which can lead to missed diagnoses.
3. The study investigated patients with GDH-positive stool specimens, dividing them into three groups based on the EIA toxin results in stool and isolates.
4. Patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates and those with dual toxin-negative stool and isolates had shorter diarrhea durations compared to those with toxin-positive stool, despite fewer receiving treatment.
5. The findings suggest that patients with toxin-negative stool may have milder symptoms, even if they are infected with toxigenic C. difficile.
6. Factors such as low toxin concentration, intestinal factors, and colonization with non-toxigenic C. difficile may contribute to the lack of toxin detection in stool specimens.
7. The use of antimicrobial drugs prior to C. difficile infection was not significantly different among the groups, and no clear correlation was observed between the type of antimicrobial drug and the presence of toxins.
8. The sensitivity of EIA for toxin detection is lower than that of PCR, but EIA directly measures the toxin proteins and is more likely to reflect the patient's actual disease status.
9. Patients with GDH-positive and toxin-negative stool specimens may be at risk of transferring the bacteria to other patients, but they may not require treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

1. The DREAM trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
2. The primary outcome variable in the present study was the change in β-cell function over the course of the follow-up, which was assessed using two measures: the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
3. Participants receiving rosiglitazone had a significant increase in IGI/IR and a significant decrease in PI/C, while there were no significant changes in these measures in participants receiving ramipril.
4. The impact of rosiglitazone on IGI/IR and PI/C was similar within subgroups of isolated IGT and combined IFG and IGT, although the effects were more modest in those with isolated IFG.
5. Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI and reduced PI concentrations over time, while ramipril did not significantly affect these measures.
6. Rosiglitazone's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline β-cell function, but the effect was attenuated after accounting for the change in β-cell function.
7. Ramipril did not have significant effects on β-cell function compared to placebo, and its glucose-lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms.

2. The study used 46 conditionally lethal auxotrophic E. coli strains to investigate metabolic interactions between pairs of strains in minimal media.
3. A subset of mixed pairs showed improved growth relative to the corresponding monocultures, indicating metabolic synergy, referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT).
4. The growth of cooperating strains was positively correlated, but an anti-correlation was observed when the cultures approached saturation.
5. SMIT interactions were able to identify biosynthetic modules and the distance between mutations in the metabolic network.
6. A flux balance analysis model was able to predict the growth of the co-cultures, with better performance for amino acid production mutants compared to nucleotide biosynthesis mutants.
7. The efficiency of cooperation, defined as the ratio of the benefit a strain receives from a metabolite to the cost of producing that metabolite, was more predictive of growth than the benefit or cost alone.
8. The results suggest that the complex emergent phenotype of SMIT growth is governed by the relatively simple stoichiometries of the metabolic reaction network.

2. BSS is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CYLD (cylindromatosis gene) on chromosome 16q12q13.
3. Patients with BSS have a low risk of malignancy and require long-term follow-up.
4. The authors present a case of a 71-year-old woman with multiple rounded skin-colored or erythematous papules on her scalp and forehead, which were diagnosed as spiradenomas and cylindromas.
5. The family history suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease.
6. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation c.1628_1629delct in the CYLD gene in the patient and her two affected daughters.
7. The unaffected daughter did not have the mutation, confirming the genetic basis of the disease.
8. The authors suggest that the particularities of the clinical manifestations (late onset, relatively low number of tumors) may be related to the specific germline mutation and the variable presence of somatic mutations.

1. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, mediated by van genes, has become an important nosocomial problem associated with high mortality and costs.
2. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) carriers, which relies on selective culturing and/or detection of the resistance genes VanA or VanB by PCR.
3. The study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert VanA/VanB assay and its impact on infection control decision-making in a setting of VanA E. faecium outbreaks.
4. The VanA PCR assay had high sensitivity (87.1%) and specificity (99.7%), while the VanB part had low specificity (77.6%) and positive predictive value (0.4%).
5. The implementation of the Xpert VanA/VanB assay allowed 96.1% of screening results to be available within 1 day, compared to a median turnaround time of 3 days for selective culturing.
6. The use of the VanA PCR results led to 141 isolation days saved and 292 transmission risk days saved, with a small number of additional days due to false-negative or false-positive results.
7. The study found VanA-positive but phenotypically vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium, highlighting the need for further investigation of such isolates.

2. The results showed that combination therapies, particularly the triple therapy (captopril + losartan + RU28318), were generally more effective than single or double therapies in improving cardiac function in both normal and diabetic hearts, regardless of whether the drugs were administered before or after ischemia.

3. In diabetic hearts, captopril + losartan dual therapy was as effective as the triple therapy, highlighting the importance of the ACE/angiotensin II/AT1 signaling cascade in the diabetic pathology.

3. Correa developed a model for gastric cancer development, suggesting a stepwise process from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and cancer, with H. pylori colonization occurring in the first decade of life.
4. Warren and Marshall discovered the role of H. pylori in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, leading to the recognition of H. pylori as a definite carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 1994.
5. Subsequent research has confirmed the association between H. pylori infection and both intestinal and diffuse-type gastric cancers, and has shown that H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.
6. The decrease in noncardia gastric cancer in North America and Western Europe, coinciding with decreasing H. pylori prevalence, has been described as the ""epidemiology of an unplanned triumph,"" while the rapid increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma may be the ""unplanned downside"" of H. pylori disappearance.

3. Evaluating the efficacy of these immunotherapies presents challenges, as they may work best in combination with other therapies, and appropriate biomarkers of response have been elusive.
4. The study used a panel of previously identified prostate-associated antigens to assess IgG immune responses in patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vaccine, and a prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) vaccine.
5. The study found that IgG responses to specific antigens were associated with the different treatments, suggesting that monitoring ""antigen spread"" could be a useful biomarker of immunological efficacy.
6. The study used machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) to identify a subset of IgG responses that were associated with a decline in serum PSA, a measure of clinical response.
7. The ML-BBN model was not a robust classifier of clinical response, likely due to the small sample size and the limitations of using PSA decline as a surrogate endpoint.
8. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ML-BBN modeling to identify promising biomarkers in complex data sets, which can then be further evaluated in larger studies.

3. The study population was divided into two groups based on the width of the urethral plate: Group A (urethral plate > 8 mm) and Group B (urethral plate < 8 mm).
4. Group B patients with a urethral plate < 8 mm had a statistically significant higher fistula rate and failed 8 Fr calibration compared to Group A patients.
5. The study also categorized the urethral plate as flat, cleft, and deeply grooved, but the differences in complication rates were not statistically significant.
6. Overall, the study found an 8% fistula rate, 12% failed 8 Fr calibration, and 1% partial dehiscence, with only 1 patient requiring redo surgery.
7. Patients with flat and narrow urethral plates developed more complications, and the use of buccal mucosal graft (BMG) with TIP repair was recommended to augment the narrow urethral plate.
8. TIP urethroplasty has good cosmetic and functional results, with advantages such as preservation and utilization of the urethral plate, a single suture line, and a low complication rate.
9. The technique can be used for primary anterior penile hypospadias with satisfactory results.
10. For patients with flat plates, augmentation with BMG may be needed to improve the results.

1. The study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo and compare the bond strength obtained with the prototype to the tensile bond strength test in a universal testing machine.
2. The prototype was developed by modifying a polypropylene plier, with a strain gauge directly connected to the claw, an electronic circuit, and a software to record the debonding force in kgf.
3. The accuracy and precision of the prototype were evaluated by using different weights, and the results showed no significant differences between the examiners.
4. The bond strength obtained with the prototype (2.96 MPa) and the tensile test in the universal testing machine (3.08 MPa) were statistically similar, suggesting that the prototype is a reliable tool for measuring bond strength in vivo.
5. The adhesive remnant index scores showed that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding, indicating that the prototype is a safe method for preserving the enamel surface.

1. Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common sexually transmitted infection that can lead to adverse reproductive health outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery. It can also increase the transmission and acquisition of other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

2. The study found that the prevalence of T. vaginalis infection was higher among older women, those with less education, and those who reported unprotected sex with non-steady partners and multiple sex partners. However, there was no association between T. vaginalis infection and the presence of vaginal symptoms.

3. The study suggests that the asymptomatic nature of T. vaginalis infection and the lack of a direct relationship between infection and symptoms make syndromic management of the infection unlikely to be effective in controlling the population burden of the infection.

4. The study highlights the need for improved disease control activities, including screening and treatment programs, to reduce the adverse reproductive health outcomes associated with T. vaginalis infection, particularly among socially marginalized populations.

1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of childhood epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment, and an abnormal EEG pattern.
2. LGS is difficult to treat, with many patients requiring polypharmacy and experiencing cumulative side effects and drug interactions.
3. Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication for LGS, but caution is needed in young children due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.
4. Rufinamide is a novel anticonvulsant drug that has shown promise in the treatment of LGS, with a significant reduction in total seizures and tonic-atonic seizures compared to placebo.
5. Rufinamide is well-tolerated, with common side effects including sedation and vomiting, and fewer cognitive or psychiatric adverse events compared to placebo.
6. Long-term follow-up studies have shown continued effectiveness of rufinamide in reducing seizures in LGS patients, with a good safety profile.
7. Rufinamide has a unique mechanism of action, involving decreased firing of high-frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.
8. Rufinamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, but caution is still needed when used in combination with other anticonvulsants, particularly phenytoin and valproic acid.
9. The role of rufinamide in the overall treatment algorithm for LGS needs to be further defined, as patients with LGS are notoriously difficult to treat.
10. Despite the challenges, rufinamide represents a welcome addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for LGS, offering a potential treatment option for this devastating condition.

1. The study found that different populations of Iberian wall lizards (Podarcis hispanica) living in a small geographical area in central Spain differed in their morphology, the composition and proportion of chemical compounds in the males' femoral gland secretions, and their chemosensory recognition abilities.

2. The northern populations were larger, heavier, and had larger heads compared to the southern populations, which could be explained by phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation to different climatic conditions. The populations also differed in the number of femoral pores and blue spots, which are used in chemical and visual communication, respectively.

3. The tongue-flick experiments showed that both males and females could discriminate between scents of individuals from the northern and southern populations, and had a higher interest for scents of lizards from their own area. Some populations also showed a clear preference for scents of individuals from their own population, suggesting the possibility of cryptic speciation mediated by chemical signals in sexual interactions.

1. Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease with low survival rates, accounting for a relatively small number of new diagnoses but ranking high in total US cancer mortality.
2. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential.
3. Survival of PDAC patients varies significantly depending on demographic characteristics, tumor characteristics, and the type of treatment performed.
4. Surgical resection of the tumor, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, is the most dramatic influence on the survival of PDAC patients, but less than 20% of patients are suitable for surgical resection.
5. The authors developed Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate survival for patients with localized PDAC (LPDAC) and extended PDAC (EPDAC), which were validated for reproducibility and generalizability.
6. The accuracy of the LPDAC and EPDAC models was assessed using C-indexes and calibration plots, and the models were found to have good discrimination and calibration.
7. The authors developed a web-based, real-time prognostic tool (estimator) that can estimate survival probability, conditional survival probability, and their standard errors for PDAC patients based on their personalized demographic and clinical data, as well as information on medical treatment.
8. The estimator has several advantages over existing models and tools, including the ability to predict survival for the vast majority of PDAC patients, real-time prediction of conditional and unconditional survival probabilities, and the inclusion of additional covariates not used in previous models.
9. The estimator can assist clinicians and patients in making more informed decisions regarding potential treatments for PDAC by providing computer-generated assessments and considering the patient's co-morbidities.

2. The diagnosis and management of CLI were compliant with the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) guidelines.
3. PTA was the first-choice procedure for revascularization, and major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions.
4. Diabetic patients had a significantly higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than those without diabetes.
5. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared to non-diabetic patients, but they had a similar life prognosis.
6. The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, and the glycemic control (A1C level) was also independently associated with major amputation in diabetic patients.
7. Mortality was associated with age, impaired activities of daily living, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level, but not with diabetes or glycemic control.
8. Diabetes with A1C ≥6.8%, infection, and hemodialysis were independently associated with major amputation, and the accumulation of these risk factors increased the amputation risk.
9. The study suggests that prognostic indicators are different between survival and limb salvage, and intervention on glycemic control may improve the prognosis of CLI patients with diabetes.

3. The study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012 to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention.
4. The results showed that less than half of the primary-prevention patients who had a high coronary heart disease (CHD) risk level received a recommendation to take aspirin, while over one-fourth of low-risk patients were also recommended to take aspirin.
5. Factors such as education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention, but objective risk level was not associated with an increased risk of recommendation for aspirin.
6. The apparent disconnect between risk for future CVD and aspirin recommendations may benefit from improved clinical decision support, such as computing actual risk in electronic health records and providing affiliated treatment recommendations.

2. Safety needs, such as personal security, financial security, and health and well-being, are more fundamental than physiological needs and can block them. The amygdala and locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system are the neural basis for safety needs, which drive the ""fight or flight"" response and emotions of fear and anger.
3. Fear and anger are two sides of the same coin, with fear being the desire to flee from danger and anger being the desire to fight against it. These emotions are triggered by unexpected or unpredictable events, which initiate a rapid safety check before the evaluation of the hedonic value of the stimulus.
4. Emotional disorders, such as anxiety, phobia, depression, and PTSD, are related to problems with the safety needs and the inability to successfully navigate the emotional flow from fear to anger to happiness and sadness.
5. Infants and neurotic adults exhibit a more direct reaction to threats and safety needs, as they have not learned to inhibit these reactions as much as healthy adults.

3. The study found that the majority of RA patients had elevated SAA levels, even in those with low or moderate disease activity, suggesting persistent inflammation.
4. Patients with high disease activity, those currently treated with glucocorticoids, and those with atherosclerotic plaques or increased cystatin-C (a marker of chronic kidney disease) had significantly higher SAA concentrations.
5. Women treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had significantly lower SAA levels compared to those treated with synthetic DMARDs, indicating better therapeutic effects of biological DMARDs.
6. The study found an inverse correlation between SAA and corrected QT (QTc) interval duration, suggesting a potential association between high SAA levels and increased risk of serious arrhythmias and sudden death.

The polyhalite microfabrics from the Hallstatt salt mine include: (1) vein-filling, fibrous polyhalite of likely middle to late Triassic age, (2) polyhalite mylonites of early Cretaceous age, (3) metamorphic reaction fabrics of a post-early Cretaceous age, and (4) cavity-filling polyhalite of uncertain age.

2. The polyhalite mylonites contain a wide range of shear fabrics commonly known in mylonitic quartz-feldspathic shear zones within the ductile crust and developed from a more coarse-grained precursor rock.

3. The mylonites are partly overprinted by recrystallized, statically grown polyhalite grains.

4. Metamorphic reaction fabrics (microfabric type b-2) of fine-grained polyhalite seams, which have grown due to the decomposition of bldite (or astrakhanite) [Na2Mg(SO4)2·4H2O] and anhydrite, have also been found.

5. Bldite may occur primarily as nodules or, more commonly, intergrown with lweite, which has a nearly identical chemical composition and is stable at higher temperatures.

6. Reaction fabrics may have formed by exsolution, (re-)crystallization, parallel growth, or replacement, and this fabric type was only found in one sample in relation with bldite, with a formation temperature of 6.2-61.4°C in the presence of halite.

2. Well-compacted root fillings offer resistance to the instruments used for retreatment, leaving root filling residues, which restricts access to the apical foramen and impairs root canal disinfection and complete reshaping.
3. The use of rotary files successfully facilitates the removal of the bulk of gutta-percha-based fillings from the root canal system, but complete removal is not achieved.
4. Endodontic retreatment might result in pushing irritants into the periapical region, causing postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.
5. The current study evaluated the extrusion of debris apically after the use of ProTaper Universal retreatment files (RFs) and different finishing files (ProTaper Next, WaveOne, and Self-Adjusting File) for removing the residual root canal fillings.
6. The results showed that the WaveOne file used after RFs extruded significantly more debris, followed by ProTaper Next and Self-Adjusting File, with the Self-Adjusting File associated with the least extrusion of debris.
7. The continuous flow of irrigant and the abrasive surface of the Self-Adjusting File helped in creating fine dust while shaping, which was easily removed by the associated continuous irrigation, leading to less apical extrusion of debris.
8. The current study concluded that all retreatment systems caused apical debris extrusion, but the Self-Adjusting File instrumentation after the RFs resulted in less extrusion than ProTaper Next and WaveOne.

1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy have enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome.
2. The genome is folded in a hierarchical manner into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), which are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.
3. TAD boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, and the strength of TAD boundaries is associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, histone marks, and replication timing.
4. The chromatin remodeling complex subunit BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength, and its knockdown results in a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.
5. BRG1 regulates nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions, and this may be the mechanism by which BRG1 contributes to TAD boundary strength.
6. BRG1 interacts with and recruits topoisomerases, which are also implicated in the regulation of TAD boundaries.
7. The association between BRG1 knockdown and reduction in TAD boundary strength may be due to perturbations in the recruitment of CTCF and topoisomerases, affecting the integrity of the chromatin structure and the stiffness of the chromatin at TAD boundaries.
8. Other chromatin remodeling complexes may play similar roles in regulating TAD formation and function.

2. The results showed that in both Poisson and negative binomial regressions, the university average and quota system had an inverse relationship with the number of failed semesters, indicating that an increase in the university average and a change from other quota systems to a free quota system led to a decrease in failed semesters.
3. The increase in the number of failed courses was found to decrease the logarithm odd of inflated zero, suggesting that an increase in the number of failed courses resulted in an increase in the number of failed semesters.
4. In the regression models with the number of failed courses as the response variable, the university average and the bachelor and master educational levels had a negative relationship, meaning that an increase in the university average and a change from other educational levels to bachelor and master levels led to a decrease in the number of failed courses.
5. The study also found that gender and marital status had an inverse and positive relationship, respectively, with the number of failed courses, where males and single students had more failed courses compared to females and married students.

2. MPI can provide high temporal and spatial resolution, and high signal-to-noise ratios, making it potentially useful for cardiovascular imaging and interventions.
3. The ideal MPI tracer should have SPIOs with a homogeneous iron core diameter of 30 nm, resulting in a relatively high hydrodynamic diameter and a shorter half-life in blood.
4. Resovist, an approved MRI contrast agent, is the most important benchmark material for MPI, but has known drawbacks, including a hydrodynamic diameter greater than 50 nm and a limited in vivo distribution.
5. The study evaluated the blood half-life of Resovist from two different distributors, Bayer Pharma AG and IROM Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS).
6. The results showed that the MPI signal in blood declined rapidly, with the signal dropping below the noise level within 30 minutes, regardless of the Resovist source.
7. There was a statistically significant difference in the signal decay between the two Resovist sources, with the Resovist from IROM Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. showing a faster decline.
8. The difference in blood half-life between the two Resovist sources may be due to factors other than the hydrodynamic diameter or size distribution, which were not significantly different.

2. Vegetation establishment is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing for productive reuse of the land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.
3. The uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment, and while irrigation can be used, it is expensive and not always more successful.
4. The study aimed to estimate the frequency of successful establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses in southern Arizona using 31 years of historical rainfall event data and a land surface model.
5. The results showed that the frequency of successful establishment was higher than expected, with 68% potential for seeding success, compared to the 10% estimate from previous studies.
6. However, the study also highlighted the complexity of the factors involved in vegetation establishment, such as germination response, root growth, and other sources of mortality, which require further consideration.

3. The researchers developed a bioinformatic approach to identify potential antisense transcripts and design saRNAs targeting the promoter regions of KLF4 and MYC.
4. The saRNAs, KLF4-PR1 and MYC-PR2, were able to consistently upregulate the expression of their target genes at both the mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
5. The saRNA-mediated upregulation of KLF4 and MYC was found to be due to transcriptional activation and did not induce an interferon response, unlike lentiviral overexpression.
6. Microarray analysis revealed that the gene expression profiles induced by saRNA treatment and lentiviral transduction showed both concordant and discordant patterns, particularly in pathways related to cytoskeletal remodeling, macropinocytosis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

1. The study followed 346 African American (AA) patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) for an average of 8 years, evaluating the effect of interferon-based therapies on outcomes.
2. Patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) had better outcomes, with no development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and reversal of fibrosis.
3. Patients who failed treatment or were not treated were at high risk for developing HCC and new-onset cirrhosis, while those who achieved end-of-treatment response (ETR) but relapsed did not develop HCC.
4. AA males were more likely to develop HCC than females, but achieving SVR or ETR with subsequent relapse protected against HCC development in both genders.
5. The study found that individual patient parameters, including serum markers and fibrosis assessments, could not reliably predict the development of HCC in AA patients.
6. Cirrhosis at the initial visit was not a significant predictor of HCC development, and fibrosis stage was the only moderately predictive factor.
7. The study suggests that with the advent of more effective direct-acting antiviral therapies, achieving SVR remains the optimal goal to prevent HCC in AA patients with CHC.

1. Stroke is the second common cause of death following ischemic heart disease, and it has accounted for nearly 5.7 million deaths globally, with 87% of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income nations.

2. The study conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene polymorphisms (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu) and the risk of ischemic stroke.

3. The meta-analysis results showed a significant association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism of ADRB2 and ischemic stroke, but no significant association was found for the Arg16Gly polymorphism.

4. The study identified some limitations, including the lack of haplotype analysis, gene-environment and gene-gene interaction studies, potential selection bias, and the inability to perform multivariate analysis due to the unavailability of individual data.

5. The study suggests that further well-designed, larger prospective cohort studies are required to validate the findings and establish the underlying molecular causal pathways that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke.

1. Methadone, a drug used in opioid addiction and pain management, has been shown to have a negative impact on human cognition, including impaired cognitive abilities in various aspects.
2. The study investigated the mechanisms underlying the methadone-induced changes in cytosolic free-calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) in SH-SY5Y cells, a model for investigating opioid-mediated responses in neurons.
3. The results suggest that methadone-induced dysregulation of calcium homeostasis is caused by improper functioning of mechanisms that directly control mitochondrial activity, rather than involvement of plasma membrane calcium channels or opioid receptors.
4. Methadone was found to induce mitochondrial fragmentation and alter the capacity of mitochondria to handle calcium, which may contribute to the observed side effects, such as memory impairment.

1. The study evaluated and compared the diagnostic performance of three morphological signs in diagnosing cirrhosis: the caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL), the right posterior hepatic notch (RPN), and the expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF). The results showed that C/RL and RPN had similar diagnostic performance, with high specificity and accuracy, while EGF had lower sensitivity but high specificity.
2. The study found no significant difference in the diagnostic performance of these signs among different Child-Pugh classes of cirrhosis, suggesting that the morphological changes are mainly represented by the hypertrophy of the caudate lobe and atrophy of the right lobe in compensated and less severe cirrhosis. The combination of these signs may improve the overall diagnostic accuracy.

1. The study found that the relative odds of identifying progression by structural (SD-OCT) or functional (SAP) tests varies according to the number of tests performed during the follow-up and the disease severity at baseline. Eyes with less severe disease at baseline had higher chances of being detected as progressing by SD-OCT compared to SAP, while eyes with more advanced disease had higher chances of being detected as progressing by SAP compared to SD-OCT.

2. The study suggests that the frequency and type of test used to monitor glaucoma progression should be tailored according to the stage of the disease, as the relative ability of structural and functional tests to detect change varies throughout the disease continuum. However, the authors note that implementing such a customized approach in clinical practice may be challenging, and a combination of structural and functional data may offer a better solution for effective monitoring of glaucoma progression.

2. Comparative analysis of the hMPV genome suggests that it is closely related to the avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and has a similar genomic organization to the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV).
3. The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage bias in 17 complete hMPV genomes and found that the preferred codons in hMPV are all ended with A/U, reflecting the high A/U nucleotide composition in the hMPV genome.
4. The effective number of codons (ENC) values for hMPV genomes ranged from 45.13 to 48.28, suggesting a conserved genomic composition among hMPV strains.
5. Correlation analysis revealed that nucleotide composition, particularly U3% and GC3%, are the major factors influencing the synonymous codon usage pattern in hMPV.
6. Correspondence analysis showed distinct differences in codon usage bias among different hMPV genotypes, suggesting that phylogenetic differences may play a role in shaping the codon usage bias.
7. Comparison of preferred codons between hMPV and its human host cell, as well as between hMPV and its avian host cell (aMPV), revealed a complementary trend, which may benefit the virus's survival and persistence in the human host.
8. The study suggests that mutation pressure, rather than natural selection, is the main force shaping the synonymous codon usage bias in hMPV.

3. The miR-200 family members are expressed in an epithelial cell-specific manner, and their expression is regulated by a double-negative feedback loop with ZEB1.
4. Restoration of miR-200c in cancer cells can lead to the repression of ZEB1 and the re-expression of E-cadherin, but this is not always the case.
5. The effects of miR-200c on cell migration, invasion, and adhesion are independent of E-cadherin status.
6. miR-200c can directly target and repress the expression of class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3), which is associated with resistance to microtubule-targeting agents like paclitaxel.
7. The increased chemosensitivity to paclitaxel observed with miR-200c restoration is due to the downregulation of TUBB3, not an increase in cell proliferation.
8. The double-negative feedback loop between miR-200c and ZEB1 is not functional in all cell lines, which can be used to dissect the distinct roles of miR-200c and ZEB1.

3. This cadaveric study compared the spatial relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT-scan image analysis.
4. The study found that the inside-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the outside-in approach, which followed a more horizontal, flatter trajectory.
5. The study also revealed that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, suggesting a passive (non-obstructive) role in achieving continence.
6. The study found a higher variability in the inside-out trajectory compared to the outside-in, underscoring the need for strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique.
7. The more horizontal positioning of the outside-in tape's trajectory, taking the mesh closer to the vaginal wall, could explain the increased rates of dyspareunia and tape exposures observed in some studies.
8. The study suggests that surgeons should pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, regardless of the approach chosen, to ensure proper placement of the tape.
