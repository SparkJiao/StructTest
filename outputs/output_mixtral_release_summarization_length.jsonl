The secondary star fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have struggled to accurately reproduce the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off. The orbital period evolution of CVs reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which is governed by mass transfer and thermal relaxation. The minimum period occurs when the mass transfer time and thermal time are approximately equal, and is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and orbital angular momentum losses. This paper investigates ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population. The authors consider a form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where the angular momentum is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary.

The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD of the qubits is always accompanied by the entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.\n7. A similar situation happens for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom for one of the two particles interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.\n8. The entanglement dynamics has been studied in a double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model, where the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system.\n9. In the presence of decoherence, the identity of the entanglement distribution among the bipartite partitions is still valid, and the distribution of entanglement among the bipartite subsystems is dependent on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.\n10. The stable entanglement distribution resulted from the bound states is a general phenomenon in open quantum systems when the non-Markovian effect is taken into account, and the result is significant to the study of the physical nature of entanglement under decoherence.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

Defining such a scheme has proven challenging, with difficulties often arising from the Hodge star and wedge product between forms.\n4. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, including Becher and Joos' use of a lattice and translation operators, Kanamori and Kawamoto's lattice and non-commutativity, and Balachandran et al.'s use of quantized phase space.\n5.

These methods are being applied to various systems, such as transition metal oxides, to calculate material properties. Realistic DMFT simulations require fast scans of the entire parameter space to determine the interaction for a given doping, degeneracy, and bandwidth via the solution of the general multiorbital Anderson impurity model (AIM). However, present approaches based on non-crossing approximation (NCA) or iterative perturbation theory (IPT) are unable to provide the solution to this problem. The quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique in DMFT is accurate but has limitations, such as being unable to cope with multiplet interactions and having applicability limited to a small number of orbitals or unphysically large temperatures due to its computational cost. Recently, some progress has been achieved using impurity solvers that improve upon the NCA approximation, but it has not been possible to retrieve fermi liquid behavior at very low temperatures in the orbitally degenerate case. An interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation is proposed, but it is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem.

These devices typically consist of both organic and inorganic components, with the organic component forming the active part and the inorganic component providing electrical contact to external circuitry. The interface between these two components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance, and understanding how charge transfers between them is essential. However, calculating the addition and removal energies of a molecule on a substrate is challenging, especially in the single-molecule limit. Upon adsorption on a substrate, the electron addition and removal energies of a molecule change due to the formation of an image charge, which alters the addition or removal energy of charge carriers from the molecule. A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies is to use a quasiparticle description, but the adequacy of this description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In this paper, the authors use constrained density functional theory (CDFT) to study the adsorption of molecules on a two-dimensional (2D) metal in various configurations, specifically considering a benzene molecule adsorbed on a sheet of graphene.

The sticking of hydrogen atoms (H) onto dust surfaces, leading to the formation of H2 and other molecules containing H atoms, is an important cooling mechanism for interstellar gas. In the ISM, dust grains are mainly carbonaceous or silicate particles with various sizes, and a significant portion of the available surface area for chemistry is in the form of very small grains or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These PAHs have characteristics similar to graphite surfaces, and can efficiently form H2 by involving a pre-adsorbed H atom in monomer or para-dimer configurations. However, the inefficient sticking of H atoms in monomers on graphitic/PAH surfaces results in a low H2 formation efficiency. The hydrogenation of PAH edges has been identified as an important route to form H2 in the ISM. Recently, coronene films exposed to H/D atoms at high temperature have shown that neutral PAHs, when highly hydrogenated, are efficient catalysts for H2 formation. PAH cations, which are usually present at lower extinction in photodissociation regions (PDRs), also represent an important route to form H2. The addition of the first H atom to PAH cations is predicted to be barrierless and exothermic, while a second H atom can react with the already adsorbed H to form H2 without a barrier.

However, measuring excited states beyond the first one has experimental challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and unavailability of detectors at specific wavelengths. This paper introduces two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states. The method uses two lasers (pump and probe) counter-propagating through a thermal vapor, with one laser modulated. The pump laser connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state, while the probe scans the desired energy manifold. Absorption of the pump laser is monitored as a function of probe laser detuning, creating sub-Doppler peaks and sidebands that overcome the limitations of direct absorption spectroscopy. The authors demonstrate the technique using two ladder systems in rubidium, with different applications of amplitude and frequency modulation. The theoretical model is based on a three-level atom in a ladder configuration interacting with two lasers, one with sidebands. The system is simplified as doppler-free and ignores Zeeman sublevels. Experimental results are obtained by solving the density matrix equations using a Floquet basis expansion. The model reproduces resonance features observed in absorption spectra for both amplitude and frequency modulated systems.

Dwarf galaxies are ideal candidates for this investigation because their kinematics are dominated by DM, even at small galactocentric radii. The Orion dwarf galaxy is particularly interesting because its kinematics suggest a cored DM density profile, which differs from the cuspy profile predicted by cold dark matter (CDM) numerical simulations. Recent studies have shown that DM halos with constant density cores provide a better fit to the kinematic data of dwarf galaxies than those with centrally peaked profiles. The Orion dwarf galaxy is one of the few known galaxies whose kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored DM profile, making it a critical system for investigating the nature of DM particles and the evolution of DM halos. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative scenario that accounts for the evidence that RCs of spiral galaxies are inconsistent with the corresponding distribution of luminous matter, without requiring the existence of DM. However, there are cases of tension between data and the MOND formalism. The Orion dwarf galaxy is a useful laboratory for testing MOND because it shows a large mass discrepancy at all radii, and its baryonic components are efficiently modeled. The distance to the Orion dwarf galaxy is critical for an unambiguous test of MOND, but there is a significant source of uncertainty in its estimated distance.

This phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the constraint of charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which can eventually destroy the Cooper pairing. The charge neutrality condition plays an essential role in determining the ground state of the neutral system. Homogeneous neutral cold-dense quark matter can be in the gapless 2SC (g2sc) or gapless CFL (gcfl) phase, depending on the flavor structure of the system. These gapless phases are stable under certain conditions and resemble the unstable Sarma state. The existence of thermal stable gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed and generalized to finite temperatures. Recent results show that the g2sc and gcfl phases can exist at moderate baryon density in the color superconducting phase diagram. In ideal color superconducting phases, the gauge bosons connected with the broken generators obtain masses, indicating the Meissner screening effect.

These transitions are mediated by the unbinding of dislocation pairs and dislocations into point defects. The KTHNY theory is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids the existence of exact long-range positional order in 2D systems at finite temperatures.

The authors argue that this design is effective for cooling the system to its ground state, but they also explore other possibilities for investigating the effects of strong reactive coupling that do not depend on cooling. They examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields and report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting.

The authors use the Heisenberg equation of motion and the input-output relation to calculate the expectation value of the output fields and obtain the nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes. They find that normal mode splitting occurs in output fields in the presence of reactive coupling, but not in its absence. The system they consider consists of a microdisk cavity coupled to a freestanding waveguide, with a strong pump field and a weak Stokes field entering the system through the waveguide. The waveguide moves along the direction of the optical force exerted by the photons from the cavity, and the displacement of the waveguide from its equilibrium position changes the resonant frequency of the cavity field and the cavity decay rate.

The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths. Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating large wave-dynamical systems, providing approximate solutions in terms of the properties of the corresponding classical system. In the case of dielectric cavities, the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard where rays travel freely and are partially reflected and refracted when impinging on the boundary. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture are being investigated for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics. Trace formulas, which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system, are essential tools in semiclassical physics. A trace formula for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators has been developed and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics. However, typical microlasers are three-dimensional (3D) systems, and trace formulas for closed 3D electromagnetic resonators have been derived and tested. Hitherto, there has been little investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of numerically solving the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities. In the case of flat microlasers, which have large in-plane extensions compared to the typical wavelength and smaller heights, complete numerical solutions are rarely performed.

This \"standard ruler\" scale should also be measurable at low redshifts, such as in large galaxy redshift surveys, allowing for constraints on the matter and energy content of the universe. However, if CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, this misinterpretation could bias low-redshift inferences. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is shown to be robust if the CMB correctly gives the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, as the actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, is used to measure the standard ruler scale. The sound horizon depends on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality, both of which are well-measured in the CMB. The baryon-to-photon ratio is measured precisely in the CMB power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the silk damping tail. The potential envelope in the CMB power spectrum encodes information about matter-radiation equality, which is normally interpreted as the matter density. However, if there are other relativistic components, measuring the redshift of equality does not imply the matter density. The sound horizon decreases by only 5% if the baryon-to-photon ratio is lowered by 23%, and understanding the acoustic oscillations allows for the translation of knowledge of the sound horizon into knowledge of the wavelength of baryonic features in the mass power spectrum.

Qubits, the basic units of quantum information, can be used for secret communication and quantum networks, and can implement quantum algorithms that are more efficient than classical ones. However, the transmission of qubits through a communication channel can result in distorted qubits due to environmental influence. Previous investigations have focused on determining channel capacity and reconstructing the original quantum state, but this article focuses on determining the properties of the quantum channel itself. This problem is essential for the reliable transfer of quantum information and the construction of quantum codes. The article is organized into several sections that cover the basics of quantum channel estimation, parametrization of quantum channels, estimation protocols for one-parameter channels, and the use of entanglement as a nonclassical resource in quantum channel estimation. The determination of all properties of a quantum channel is important for any quantum communication protocol, and quantum channels can be transmission lines, storage for quantum systems, or uncontrolled time evolution of the underlying quantum system. In practice, the behavior of such channels is generally not known from the beginning, so methods to gain this knowledge are necessary. This is only possible with infinite resources, but in practical applications, such a condition will never be fulfilled. Therefore, channel estimation, rather than channel determination, is necessary. A quantum channel describes the evolution affecting the state of a quantum system and can describe effects like decoherence or interaction with the environment, as well as controlled or uncontrolled time evolution. In mathematical terms, a quantum channel is a completely positive linear map that transforms a density operator to another density operator.

The rest is 23% dark matter and 73% dark energy, whose nature is unknown. Dark matter allows for the explanation of the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of visible matter. It is believed to play a crucial role in the formation of large structures by pulling ordinary matter into gravitational collapse. Dark matter must have been non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation and is therefore referred to as cold dark matter (CDM). There is no explanation for dark matter or dark energy in the standard model of particle physics, but extensions to the model provide good candidates for the dark matter particle, such as the neutralino in supersymmetry theories. Dark energy appears as a constant energy density in the expansion of the universe, implying a violation of energy conditions with negative pressure. It could be the cosmological constant that Einstein introduced in his general relativity equations to obtain a static universe. The CDM model has been successful in precisely fitting the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background and reproducing large structures, despite the mystery of its constituents. The manifestation of dark matter in galaxies is clear through the flat rotation curves of galaxies, where the velocity remains constant despite the distance from the center. This requires the presence of a massive, invisible halo of dark matter. Simulations of CDM in cosmology suggest a universal profile for the dark matter halo, but they also predict a central density peak and a large number of satellite galaxies, which are not observed.

In disordered systems, the presence of negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) disordered metamaterials suppresses Anderson localization, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths. A sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength has been observed under refractive-index disorder, instead of the well-known quadratic asymptotic behavior. The effects of polarization and oblique incidence on light propagation in disordered metamaterials have also been studied.\n\nThis article calculates the localization length of light for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating indices of refraction and thicknesses, introducing disorder by changing the position of the layer boundaries.

An exhaustive study of the localization length in the allowed and forbidden bands of weakly disordered systems is performed, showing that the localization length is modulated by the corresponding bands and this modulation decreases as the disorder increases.\n\nIn the case of low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths much greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.

The protein folds into a specific shape responsible for its activity, and finding the configuration of a particular molecule is a challenging task due to the large number of monomers and the complexity of their interactions. A physicist's approach to this problem is to use simplified models, sacrificing specificity for more general information. The text then describes simple models of heteropolymers as examples of disordered systems with connections to spin glasses, and recent experimental studies of solutions and gels of polymers with randomly charged groups. The authors focus on a model polyampholyte (PA) - a flexible chain where each of the monomers has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches. The overall size and shape of a PA with charged groups are most likely controlled by the Coulomb interactions that are the strongest and with the longest range. The text then explores the phase diagrams of quenched PAs in different dimensions, showing that for certain dimensions, the behavior of PAs is similar to that of random chains with short-range interactions, while for others, the spatial conformations of a PA strongly depend on its excess charge.

The detection of cosmic rays is challenging due to the extensive air showers they produce as they cascade through the atmosphere, but techniques such as shower measurements and indirect methods can be used to reconstruct the arrival directions and shower energy, and to extract the nature of the primary particle. The detected particles are mainly protons, and for energies above a few tens of GeV, they have arrival directions with a remarkably isotropic distribution, which is understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields. However, for energies above a given value that depends on the charge of the particle, propagation in the galaxy is expected to cease to be diffusive, and such high-energy particles are expected to be extragalactic.

The disk precession is prograde in the rest frame, and the secondary repeats its motion with respect to the disk on the beat period between the orbital period and the precession period, a few percent longer than the orbital period.

Recently, the preparation of thin films of B20-type MnSi on silicon substrates has offered promising prospects for spintronic device applications. MnSi films provide a variety of magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the established silicon technology. The benefit of thin films is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to uniaxial anisotropy. However, the low magnetic ordering temperature is a drawback. Therefore, the aim is to find compounds with similar spin order at higher temperatures. MnGe, a B20 compound with a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K, is a suitable candidate. MnGe has a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3nm at lowest temperatures and 6nm near Tc. Recently, a large topological Hall effect, attributed to a skyrmion phase, was observed in MnGe. Small angle neutron scattering experiments provided further evidence for the existence of skyrmions. However, the synthesis of MnGe is laborious, forming only under high pressure and temperatures between 600 and 1000\u00b0C. Molecular beam epitaxy allows for thin film growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Despite this, there has been no successful attempt to grow MnGe on Ge due to the formation of MnGe. The use of Si(111) as a substrate offers the opportunity to prepare a seed layer of MnSi, which realizes the B20 crystal structure for MnGe growth. The lattice constant of MnGe within the (111) plane matches that of Si with a misfit of only 2%, allowing for compressively strained MnGe films on Si(111) substrates. This paper presents a preparation method for MnGe thin films on Si substrates with the aid of a MnSi seed layer.

The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star and eventually explodes. The model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel.

The security of these systems, which use prepare-and-measure (PM) implementation, has been confirmed through the security analysis of equivalent entanglement-based (EB) schemes. However, traditional security analysis of the EB scheme in CVQKD only considers the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), an auxiliary light beam used for phase reference in balanced homodyne detection. This leaves security loopholes, as LO is within Eve's manipulation domain. The necessity of monitoring LO intensity for security proofs in discrete QKD protocols has been discussed, and the excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of the balanced homodyne detector in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations has been noted and quantified. In practical CVQKD implementation, shot noise scaling with LO power, measured before key distribution, is assumed to remain constant, with pulses exhibiting large LO intensity fluctuations being discarded. This approach, however, gives Eve an advantage in exploiting LO intensity fluctuations. This paper discusses Bob's measurements under LO intensity fluctuations, proposes an attacking scheme that exploits this fluctuation, and calculates the secret key rate with and without Bob monitoring the LO for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols.

Although originally proposed as a model for neutrinos, MFs have been predicted to occur as quasiparticle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems. These particles obey non-Abelian statistics, making them promising for decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing. Over the past few years, the search for MFs has focused on topological superconductors, and various platforms including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains have been proposed to support Majorana states based on the superconducting proximity effect. However, observing the unique Majorana signatures experimentally is still a challenging task. MFs are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs). Although ZBPs have been observed in semiconductor nanowires and are interpreted as the signatures of MFs, these results cannot serve as definitive evidence for the existence of MFs in condensed matter systems. Experimentally distinguishing Majorana bound states from conventional fermionic subgap states is a major challenge. The text proposes an alternative all-optical scheme to detect MFs using a hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system. This scheme avoids introducing signals that could disturb the detection of MFs by eliminating direct contact between MFs and the hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system. The interaction between MFs in iron chains and the quantum dot in the hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system is mainly due to dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers, ensuring that the tunneling between the quantum dot and MFs can be neglected safely. The quantum dot is considered as a two-level system, and once MFs appear in the ends of iron chains and couple to the quantum dot, the Majorana signature will be carried out via the coherent optical spectrum of the quantum dot. The change in the coherent optical spectrum serves as another potential evidence for MFs in the iron chains.

However, there are states of matter where an order parameter can only be defined in a complicated non-local way, such as in topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin hall states, or quantum spin liquids.

Unsupervised learning algorithms, which can find structure in unlabeled data and classify data into clusters, have been used to reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model and find phase transitions using principal component analysis.

The dust in the torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits it in the infrared. Type 1 AGN show more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity, which is consistent with the face-on view of the torus exposing the innermost hot dust to the observer in Type 1 AGN and the edge-on view being blocked by internal obscuration in Type 2 AGN. The anisotropy in the infrared has implications for forming isotropic AGN samples based on infrared fluxes and distinguishing torus models with smoothly distributed dust from those with dust arranged in clouds. High spatial resolution observations or using high luminosity objects can help mitigate the problem of host galaxy contribution to the infrared emission. This paper aims to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of AGN emission in the infrared using a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars.

The powering mechanism of SXRTs in the quiescent state is unclear, but a possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) turns on.\n4. AQL X-1 is the most active SXRT known, with over 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts, and a K1V variable star companion with a 19-hour orbital period.\n5. The outbursts of AQL X-1 are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with type I X-ray bursts indicating the presence of a neutron star.\n6.

Semiconductor quantum dots with controlled electron numbers are good candidates for realizing qubits, which can be encoded using an electron charge or spin. Spin qubits have longer decoherence times and can be manipulated using electron spin resonance and read out via currents in spin-polarized leads. Another concept for encoding qubits is based on the singlet-triplet states in a double quantum dot, which can be prepared and manipulated by electrical control of the exchange interactions. In a triangular geometry, three coherently coupled quantum dots can form a decoherence-free subspace that is immune to decoherence processes and can be controlled by purely electrical means, providing faster operations and more complex energy spectra. Recent experimental efforts have demonstrated coherent spin manipulations in a linear triple quantum dot system. The proposal by Divincenzo et al. to encode the qubit in a triangular triple quantum dot has been studied using an electric field to modify the exchange coupling and generate chiral or flux-penetrated states. The authors' idea is to use the fully electrical control of the symmetry of the triple quantum dot to encode and manipulate the qubit in the doublet subspace, and propose a new detection method called the doublet blockade effect, which manifests itself in currents for a special configuration of the local potential gates, and is fully compatible with purely electrical manipulations of the qubit. The dynamics of the qubit are studied, taking into account relaxation and decoherence processes due to coupling with the electrodes and leakage from the doublet subspace. The system is a triangular artificial molecule built of three coherently coupled quantum dots with a single electron spin on each dot, and the exchange interactions are described by an effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a Zeeman term for splitting by an external magnetic field.

The system has experienced periodic outbursts, including a series of eruptions in 1984 and 1986. These outbursts may be the result of varying wind velocities and accretion rates, leading to the formation of an optical thick wind and the collision of stellar winds. The collision of winds creates shock fronts and affects the ionization and temperature of the system. The 1984-1986 outburst is notable for its double-peaked structure and low brightness, which may be the result of red giant pulsation and the collision of the white dwarf wind with ejected shells. The minimum between the two peaks is accompanied by a dip in the ionization parameter. The outburst did not reach its maximum luminosity due to the distortion of the wind network by the oncoming of the next shell. Broad lines and jets, which were not observed during the 1984-1986 outburst, are common in other symbiotic systems and are thought to originate from high-velocity matter accompanying outbursts and the presence of an accretion disk. The distance of the nebulae from the center of the system has been calculated in previous works by adjusting the continuum fluxes calculated by the models at the nebula to those observed at earth. The best fit to the data of the bremsstrahlung calculated from the nebulae downstream of the shock front gives the distance of the nebula from the center of the system at various points in time. The drop of the ionization parameter between November and December 1985 most probably derives from the sudden increase of the distance from the hot source, which is explained by the ejection of the next shell in the red giant atmosphere. The collision between the wind from the white dwarf and the two shells from the red giant occurred within less than 2 years, causing the shock front to expand and the ionization parameter to decrease.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

A more direct way of detecting weak lensing uses fluxes of standard candles, with the effect of lensing causing brighter sources to lie behind regions of mass density excess and fainter sources to have mass deficits in their foregrounds.

A proposed solution is to generate effective spin-orbit couplings from ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed to generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI). However, realizing this proposed topological phase in real materials has not been achieved, and the stability of TMIs against competing orders and quantum fluctuations is not clear. Reliable examination of stable topological mott orders in the extended Hubbard model is hampered by competing symmetry breakings such as charge density waves (CDWs). Couplings driving the topological Mott transitions are also relevant to formations of a CDW, which has not been satisfactorily discussed in previous studies. The emergence of the TMI in the honeycomb lattice requires the Coulomb repulsion between the next nearest neighbor sites, and the long-period CDW instability must be considered on equal footing, which is not captured in the small-unit-cell mean-field ansatz employed in previous studies. Examining charge fluctuations with finite momentum over entire Brillouin zones is an alternative way to clarify the competitions among TMIs and CDWs, as studied by employing functional renormalization group methods.

Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with the ratio of total to selective extinction being a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law. This ratio has been found to be tightly correlated with the overall shape of the reddening law.

The authors of this paper study the strong Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\u00e1s property (SBPBp) for bounded linear operators, which is a variant of the Kim-Lee theorem where the initial functional is not changed. They prove some positive results for the SBPBp and negative results for the uniform case.

The spin of the black hole plays a significant role in shaping the line, determining the position of the marginally stable orbit that confines the inner edge of the accretion disc. The Laor model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used to describe these relativistic disc spectral lines. However, recent models, such as the ones by KY, allow for the spin to be fitted during data fitting procedures. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin if the inner edge of the disc is identified with the marginally stable orbit. The paper compares the Laor model to another relativistic line model, and applies them to current data from the XMM-Newton satellite and artificial data generated for the upcoming X-ray mission. The two sources chosen, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, exhibit skewed iron lines and marginally stable orbits.

The link between star formation and molecular gas is not necessarily causal, but molecular gas is a crucial tracer of star-forming regions. Understanding the connections between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution requires identifying the conditions that allow cold molecular gas to develop. The temperature of the gas determines the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores, and accurately modeling small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations requires tracking molecular chemistry. Young, massive stars are the main source of far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons that permeate the ISM and photodissociate interstellar molecules. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding have attenuated the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity. The transition zones between atomic and molecular gas, called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively, and the outer layers of a PDR are typically composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon. As column density increases, the atomic-to-molecular transition begins to occur, with the C-CO transition occurring interior to the HI-H2 one. Deeper still, when external FUV photons have been entirely absorbed, the chemistry and thermodynamics become dominated by the presence of deep penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains. Simply understanding the structure of a non-dynamic, one-dimensional PDR is of limited utility, as the ISM is a dynamic environment where a variety of non-linear, coupled processes determine the global distribution and state of gas. Star forming complexes are continually assembled through self-gravity, while stellar feedback acts to disperse the structures. Turbulent motions dissipate through radiative shocks but are continually replenished through a combination of supernovae and stellar winds. Thermal processes, such as dust grain photoelectric heating and molecular line cooling, further influence the state of the ISM and are sensitive functions of ambient radiation fields, column density, and the non-equilibrium chemical state of the gas.

The only 2p-2h model implemented up to date in some Monte Carlo neutrino event generators is the so-called IFIC Valencia model, incorporated in GENIE. There are also plans to incorporate the Lyon model in GENIE, while phenomenological approaches like the Effective Transverse Enhancement Model are implemented in NuWro generator. Implementing 2p-2h models is challenging due to the high computational time required for the large number of nested integrals involved. Several approximations can be made to speed up the calculations, such as choosing an average momentum for the nucleons in the local Fermi gas, neglecting exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations to two nested integrals by performing a non-relativistic expansion of the current operators. In this work, the authors present a fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the Relativistic Fermi Gas model (RFG), called the frozen nucleon approximation, which reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 (full calculation) to 1.

However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations show no decrease in the observable gap fraction as the contribution from gluon-induced dijet events is reduced, and the D0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum. The two-gluon exchange model has limitations and the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative. Within an unitarized model, non-perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters, the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift. The implications for the formation of gaps at the Tevatron are analyzed by calculating how the gap fraction between two hard jets varies with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation and then comparing predicted fractions with Tevatron data.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 8}}

Nerve repair using current gold standard treatments, such as end-to-end suturing and autograft or allograft biological tissue, has limitations. Tissue engineering and biomaterials suggest that nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) may be a promising approach for nerve repair. However, FDA-approved tissue engineered nerve devices do not possess the proper physical topography or chemical cues for nerve repair and regeneration, and most are currently limited to a critical nerve gap of approximately 4 cm. The invention provides a fabricated implantable NGC with an inner spiral structured porous sheet, which can facilitate regeneration of nerve tissues and serve as a medical device to treat peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) and restore function to the site of the injury. The spiral structure increases the surface area available for cell migration and attachment, and can reduce the length of time needed for recovery. A highly-aligned set of electrospun fibers are present within the surface channels and on the backs thereof, ensuring that the regenerating nerve will come into contact with aligned fibers. The conduit is tunable such that its length and diameter can be varied controllably depending on how it is to be used. The invention also provides a process for fabricating an implantable NGC, which can be used as a medical device for facilitating the repair and regeneration of nerve tissues. </summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

This is a challenging task when a scene contains multiple objects, and it has recently gained significant interest in the computer vision community. The goal of salient object detection is to replicate the human ability to prioritize objects for high-level processing. It has numerous applications, including image recognition, compression, video summarization, media re-targeting, photo collage, image quality assessment, image segmentation, content-based image retrieval, image collection browsing, image editing and manipulating, visual tracking, object discovery, and human-robot interaction. A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past seven years. A salient object detection model typically consists of two steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area. So far, models have bypassed the first challenge by focusing on scenes with single objects. They perform well on the second step, as demonstrated by high performances on existing biased datasets. However, it is unclear how current models perform on complex cluttered scenes with several objects. Despite the volume of past research, this trend has not been fully pursued due to the lack of suitable benchmark datasets for scaling up models and a widely agreed objective definition of the most salient object. The paper aims to provide solutions for these problems and discover which component might be the weakest link in the possible failure of models when migrating to complex scenes.

In its simplest version, called Heegaard Floer homology, it associates a vector space to a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold and a map to a connected, oriented four-dimensional cobordism decorated with a 2-structure. These maps can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary. For example, two 4-manifolds with boundary the Brieskorn sphere can be shown to be homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic by comparing their Heegaard Floer invariants. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer homology involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, which are related to the three-manifolds and cobordisms involved via Heegaard diagrams. In 2010, Sarkar and the third author showed that every three-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles. Using such a diagram, holomorphic disks in the symmetric product can be counted combinatorially, giving a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any three-manifold as well as of the hat version of Heegaard Floer homology of null-homologous knots and links in any three-manifold. A similar result was obtained for all versions of the Heegaard Floer homology of knots and links in the three-sphere. The goal of this paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps when the cobordism is between two three-manifolds with the property that the induced maps on the Heegaard Floer groups are surjective. This case includes all cobordisms for which the torsion is torsion, as well as all those consisting of only 2-handle additions. The computation of the ranks of these maps goes as follows: the cobordism is decomposed into a sequence of one-handle additions, two-handle additions, and three-handle additions.

{"idx": 199, "result": 0, "generated": " In physics, understanding the physical picture responsible for a phenomenon is as important as calculating observables. When a theory becomes too complicated at a certain scale, it is necessary to select essential degrees of freedom. For example, in crystals, although the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, understanding electric conductivity and heat capacity involves working with \"heavy electrons\" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interactions. This simplification hides the complex electromagnetic interaction of electrons with ions in the lattice, and the interactions among ions in the lattice are responsible for collective excitations of the lattice - phonons, which are Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken translational invariance.\n\nA similar situation occurs in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). While the ultimate goal is to solve the full nonquenched QCD on the lattice and obtain the correct nucleon and pion mass in terms of underlying degrees of freedom, the theory becomes too complicated at the scale of 1 GeV. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is identified as the most important QCD phenomenon for the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties. Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks that interact by the exchange of Goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.\n\nThe spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD leads to two important generic consequences: the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass, which represent the associated approximate Goldstone bosons, and the acquisition of a dynamical mass by valence (practically massless) quarks, often referred to as constituent quarks. Constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles whose dynamical mass comes from nonperturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing.\n\nThe flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit implies that the constituent quarks and Goldstone bosons should be coupled with a strength that satisfies a quark analog of the famous Goldberger-Treiman relation. The microscopical mechanism for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD is not yet fully understood, but sufficiently strong scalar interaction between quarks can induce", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

The secondary star transfers mass to the compact object via Roche-lobe overflow, creating an accretion disk that emits X-rays. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: z-sources and atoll sources. Z-sources are usually the brightest LMXBs in X-rays and have high accretion rates, while atoll sources have lower accretion rates and fragmented island-like regions in their color-color diagrams. The main physical difference between z-sources and atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.\n\nLMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that shows the properties of a z-source, indicating a high accretion rate around the Eddington limit. It is one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known, but its X-ray flux is low due to its extra-galactic nature. Despite being X-ray luminous and having a known optical counterpart, little is known about the system parameters of LMCX-2. The estimates for the orbital period range from 6.4 hours to 12 days, and no periodic variability was detected in 6 years of MACHO data.\n\nRecently, steeghs & casares (2002) developed a technique to detect a signature of the donor star in persistent LMXBs using phase-resolved spectroscopy.

The present disclosure provides a person support apparatus with a channel element in one or both sides of the person support frame for guiding the leg assembly.\n5. The channel element has a substantially continuous upper surface, two substantially continuous side surfaces, and a downward facing opening, and the first upper end portion of the leg assembly includes a guide or follower element arranged to contact and run along an inner surface of the channel element.\n6. This arrangement results in a deck support frame that is robust and stable and can accommodate changes in geometry necessary for movement or adjustment between the horizontal, Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg positions.\n7. The channel and roller mechanism change the height of a patient support deck by pivoting one or more leg assemblies relative to the under surface of the patient support frame.\n8. Features of some illustrative embodiments include a lower part count, an opening of the channel facing the floor, a leg assembly working vertically within the channel edges, and a mechanism that includes a guide element inside a channel element.\n9. These features make the mechanism less likely to fail, harder for a patient or care-giver to trap their fingers, and allow the outside surface of the longitudinal channel element to be used as a fixing area for accessories or other elements.\n10. Additional features may comprise patentable subject matter and will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the detailed description of various embodiments. </summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

The hydraulic unit includes a housing block, a motor, a housing, and a covering hood. The motor is secured to the housing block and has a shaft connected to an eccentric, which is part of a cam element chamber. The system includes first conduit portions that extend downward from the cam element chamber and discharge into spring chambers. These conduit portions allow pressure fluid from the cam element chamber to flow into the spring chambers, preventing dirt and water from entering the bores from below. A generic pressure equalization conduit exists between the spring chambers and the interior of the motor, allowing air to escape when a piston moves counter to the force of its spring. A pressure equilibrium is created between the interior of the motor and the housing, which is sealed off relative to the housing block. This is achieved through a pressure equalization conduit formed by interstices between wires of a cable and a tubular cable sheath that sheathes the wires. The cable sheath is introduced into a further sealing sleeve, which is located inside a second plug part, and is connected at least indirectly to a connection cable in a way that equalizes pressure.

{"idx": 259, "result": 0, "generated": " This text describes a continuation of an abandoned patent application for a fabric treatment apparatus. The invention is an improved version of existing apparatuses for treating a textile web with a liquid, such as a washing or rinsing solution. The apparatus includes a conveyor, a liquid applicator, a suction device, and a dwell stretch. The conveyor is an endless sieve belt that transports the textile web along a predetermined horizontal path. The applicator applies the liquid to the web during motion, and the suction device removes the liquid from the web by a suction process during motion. The dwell stretch conducts the textile web in a spread-out condition and in a single layer through at least one dwell loop. This allows for a longer action time of the applied liquid on the substances to be removed from the fabric or textile web, resulting in a surprising improvement of the washing effect. The apparatus is especially advantageous for printed material, as it allows for effective washing without soiling a white background. A preferred area of application is soilage washing, which can remove considerable amounts of soilage at relatively little expense. The dwell stretch device can be formed by an air pass, wherein the textile web is completely free of support or guiding elements at least along major portions of the dwell stretch and is accessible to the atmosphere at all sides. Alternatively, the dwell stretch can include at least one freely rotatable drum disposed above the upper section of the sieve belt, with at least two rollers disposed laterally adjacent to one another below the drum for guiding the web to and from the drum.

The present invention is a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, specifically an insulated gate (MOS) field effect semiconductor device with a lightly doped drain (LDD) structure.\n2. In the conventional manufacturing method, an oxide film on the gate sidewall is used as a mask in subsequent steps, making it difficult to determine the termination point of anisotropic RIE etching, which can result in variability of the oxide portion width and even etching away of the source/drain region.\n3. The conventional LDD structure also has issues with leakage currents due to the inability to make the low concentration n-type region amorphous, preventing the formation of shallow junctions and minimization of the device size.\n4.

{"idx": 403, "result": 0, "generated": " The current surface transportation programs in the United States are not effectively addressing the nation's transportation challenges, as they were established without a clear vision of the federal role and are not linked to performance or needs. Many programs lack rigorous economic analysis and are not fiscally sustainable due to increased spending without commensurate revenue increases. The federal role in surface transportation has expanded over time to include broader goals, more programs, and various program structures. While some goals have led to new grant programs, others have resulted in additional procedural requirements. The majority of surface transportation funds remain dedicated to highway infrastructure, but there is a variety of grant structures and federal approaches for establishing priorities and distributing funds. Federal surface transportation programs have been found to be ineffective at addressing key challenges due to unclear goals and a lack of links to needs or performance. Most highway, transit, and safety grant funds are distributed through formulas that only indirectly relate to needs and may have no relationship to performance. The largest safety grants are more likely to be focused on goals rather than specific transportation systems, and several highway safety and motor carrier safety grants allocate incentive funds based on performance. However, since the majority of surface transportation funds are distributed without regard to performance, it is difficult to assess the impact of recent record levels of federal highway expenditures. Mechanisms to link programs to goals also appear insufficient, and the federal government does not possess adequate data to assess outcomes or implement performance measures. Surface transportation programs often do not employ the best tools and approaches to ensure effective investment decisions, and tools to make better use of existing infrastructure have not been deployed to their full potential. The solvency of the federal surface transportation program is at risk due to expenditures exceeding revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. The reallocation of fuel tax funds to the Highway Trust Fund has been insufficient to sustain current spending levels, and federal funding for transportation may not lead to a commensurate increase in total investment due to state and local governments shifting nonfederal funds away from highways to other purposes.

The 9/11 Commission identified the need to improve screener performance and better understand the reasons for performance problems. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and gave it responsibility for securing all modes of transportation, including aviation. TSA oversees security operations at the nation's more than 450 commercial airports, including passenger and checked baggage screening operations. TSA has taken actions to enhance the training of screeners and Screening Supervisors but has encountered difficulties in providing access to recurrent training. TSA has faced challenges in providing access to recurrent training due to insufficient staffing and a lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at some training facilities. TSA has enhanced its basic screener training program by updating the training to reflect changes to standard operating procedures and deploying a new dual-function (passenger and checked baggage screening) basic training curriculum. However, a recent study by the DHS OIG found that while incorporating the standard operating procedures into the curricula was a positive step, a number of screener job tasks were incompletely addressed in or were absent from the basic training courses. TSA officials stated that the new dual-function training provides the optimum training solution based on the specific needs of each airport and reflects the fact that at some airports the FSD does not require all screeners to be fully trained in both passenger and checked baggage screening functions. Some FSDs, particularly those at smaller airports, have made use of the flexibility offered by the modular design of the new course to train screeners immediately upon hire in both passenger and checked baggage screening functions. In April 2004, TSA also provided FSDs with the flexibility to deliver basic screener training using local instructors. TSA\u2019s Workforce Performance and Training Office developed basic screener training internally, and initially, contractors delivered all of the basic training. Since then, TSA has provided FSDs with the discretion to provide the training using local TSA employees or to use contractors. The flexibility to use local employees allows FSDs and members of the screener workforce to leverage their first-hand screening knowledge and experience and address situations", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

Ginnie Mae has several different products, including its original MBS program, Ginnie Mae I, and its more flexible Ginnie Mae II MBS program. It also offers Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMIC) and Ginnie Mae Platinum Securities. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on securities backed by pools of government-insured or guaranteed loans, but investors do not face credit risk because the underlying mortgages are federally insured or guaranteed. Ginnie Mae charges issuers a guarantee fee for providing its guarantee of timely payment, and issuers also pay a commitment fee for the authority to pool mortgages into Ginnie Mae MBS. Ginnie Mae does not receive appropriations or borrow money to finance its credit operations, and its revenues exceed its expenses, reducing the federal budget deficit. Ginnie Mae securities finance the great majority of FHA and VA loans, but the agency faces relatively little competition in the market for government-backed mortgage loans. However, Ginnie Mae's share of the total MBS market has declined over the last 20 years, both in terms of new issuances and volume outstanding, largely because FHA and VA loan origination has not kept pace with growth in the overall mortgage market and because securitization of conventional mortgages has become far more prevalent. Ginnie Mae issued its first MBS in 1970 and has guaranteed a cumulative total of more than $2 trillion of MBS since then. According to Ginnie Mae, its securities historically have represented roughly 90 percent of the market for FHA and VA loans.

DOD has developed new protective equipment, such as the JSLIST suit, and plans to spend $5.7 billion on chemical and biological defense from 2002 through 2007. However, DOD's assessment process for determining the risk to military operations is unreliable, and its current determination that the risk is generally low is inaccurate. DOD's 2000 report on readiness for operations in a chemically and biologically contaminated environment contains erroneous inventory data and understates equipment requirements. The methodology for assessing the risk is flawed because it is not based on the number of complete ensembles needed and it obscures military service readiness by combining service data and reporting the results jointly. DOD's criteria for assessing the risk of wartime shortages is to determine the numbers of protective suits, masks, breathing filters, gloves, boots, and hoods it has on hand, compared against the requirements for those individual items, but this approach may result in inaccurate risk assessments. For example, in the draft fiscal year 2001 annual report to Congress, DOD reported that it was generally at low risk for suits, but when the risk assessment process was adjusted to account for errors and miscounts in the number of protective suits on hand, the risk category changed to high. The risk remained high for suits, as well as for filters, boots, and hoods, based on new equipment requirements accepted by the Joint Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Board. DOD has inaccurately assessed the risk to military operations by determining the number of individual items of equipment it has on hand and by combining the services' inventories of individual items. Service guidance specifies that a total of 1,573,866 active and reserve servicemembers need protection to meet current operations plan requirements, but DOD does not report each service's readiness based on the equipment it has", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 10}}

Of the respondents, 81% modified the formulas of one or more of their DB plans, with 48% decreasing the generosity of their plans for nonbargaining employees and 58% increasing the generosity for collectively bargained employees. The key reasons for changing the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees were unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements, while global or domestic competitive pressures were the key reasons for changes to plans covering collectively bargained employees. Sponsors were more likely to convert a DB plan covering nonbargaining unit employees to a hybrid plan design than to convert DB plans covering collectively bargained employees.

FEMA, within the Department of Homeland Security, manages NFIP. Over the years, Congress has enacted legislation to strengthen the program, including mandatory purchase requirements and grant programs for properties with repetitive flooding losses. However, NFIP still faces financial challenges due to subsidized premium rates, grandfathered properties, and full-risk rates that may not accurately reflect actual flood risks. Increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss could result in more accurate premium rates, decreased costs for taxpayers, and encouraged private market participation. However, this could also increase costs for some homeowners, potentially reducing participation and increasing taxpayer costs for postdisaster assistance. A catastrophic loss fund within NFIP could help pay for catastrophic losses, but steep increases in premiums could reduce participation and increase taxpayer costs. A variety of actions could be taken to mitigate these disadvantages, such as phasing out subsidized rates over time or not transferring them with property sales. Increasing mitigation efforts could further reduce flood damage to properties and communities, helping to put NFIP on a firmer financial footing and reducing taxpayers' exposure.

{"idx": 464, "result": 0, "generated": " Both mutual funds and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and invest them in the economy. Banks make loans or invest in debt securities, while mutual funds invest in securities such as stocks and bonds. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with companies increasingly turning to securities markets for their financial needs. This trend has been driven by the issuance of short-term securities like commercial paper and the securitization of assets such as mortgages and consumer loans. The growth of mutual funds has also contributed to this trend, as they have attracted significant amounts of money that might have otherwise been placed in bank deposits. Despite this, bank deposits still remain a larger source of funds than mutual funds. The impact of mutual funds on deposits includes not only direct withdrawals from deposits for the purpose of investing in mutual funds, but also the diversion of new receipts that might have been placed in deposits. The Flow of Funds Accounts published by the Federal Reserve provides data on the amounts outstanding and net flows of various financial instruments, including bank deposits and mutual funds. The relative importance of bank loans has also been diminished by the increased provision of direct loans by nonbank financial intermediaries such as securities firms, insurance companies, and finance companies. The Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry Association agree that the flow of funds into mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits, although the magnitude of this impact is disputed. The GAO concluded that a reasonable estimate of the impact of mutual funds on deposits is sizable but probably less than $700 billion. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should not affect the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy, but it may shift the intermediaries through which finance flows. Both mutual funds and banks generally invest a substantial portion of the funds they receive, with mutual funds investing mainly in securities and banks investing in loans and certain kinds of securities. The funds' purchases of securities have become a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending.

Northrop Grumman plays the largest role, developing the sunshield, the OTE, the spacecraft, and a cooling subsystem for the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Harris is manufacturing the test equipment, equipping the test chamber, and assisting in the testing of the optics of JWST. STScI will collect and evaluate research proposals from the scientific community and will receive and store the scientific data collected, both of which are services that they currently provide for the Hubble Space Telescope. The MIRI instrument requires a dedicated, interdependent two-stage cooler subsystem designed to cool the infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin, just above absolute zero. This cooler is referred to as a cryocooler and works by moving helium gas through about 10 meters of refrigerant lines located on the sun-facing surface of the JWST observatory to the colder, shaded side where the ISIM is located.

Demonstration projects in the 1980s and 1990s showed that using statistical methods and administrative data to identify those likely to experience long periods of joblessness, and providing more intensive job search assistance, reduced the duration of insured unemployment and UI expenditures. In response, the Clinton administration proposed legislation to implement worker profiling in 1993, which was enacted in the Unemployment Compensation Amendments. The law requires states to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for UI regular compensation, identifying those likely to exhaust regular compensation and refer them to reemployment services. States are required to collect information on the type of services claimants receive, their participation, and their subsequent employment outcomes. Labor issued guidance in 1994 to help states establish profiling tools and provide necessary reemployment services, and recommended considering factors such as education, tenure at previous job, and state unemployment rate. Under the law, states must require that claimants who have been referred to reemployment services participate in those services as a condition of eligibility for receiving compensation. Labor may withhold UI administrative grants from a state if it finds that a state has failed to comply with worker-profiling requirements. The law required that Labor report to Congress on the operation and effectiveness of the profiling system within three years of its enactment. Labor issued a report to Congress in March 1997, and published a final report in 1999 on the program\u2019s implementation and operation nationwide and the effectiveness in six early implementation states. Labor has published no studies on the effectiveness of the initiative since then.

Over time, a regulatory system has developed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 revealed weaknesses in the financial regulatory system and led to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010. This law aimed to strengthen regulation and address risks in the financial system.

The report also provides a list of Congressional Research Service reports that examine specific bills related to banking policy. Bank failures can cause large losses for stakeholders, including taxpayers, and can also lead to systemic stress and sharp contractions in economic activity. To prevent failures, regulators utilize prudential regulation, which includes ratio requirements and restrictions on permissible activities. Ratio requirements, such as capital and liquidity ratios, help ensure that banks are able to absorb losses and meet their obligations. Restrictions on permissible activities, such as the Volcker Rule, aim to reduce risks and prevent banks from engaging in certain activities that could lead to failures. The balance sheet of a bank is divided into assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are largely the value of loans and securities owned by the bank, while liabilities are the value of deposits and borrowings the bank owes to savers and creditors. Capital is raised through various methods, including issuing equity to shareholders or issuing special types of bonds that can be converted into equity. Capital is important because it does not require repayment of a specified amount of money and can fluctuate in value.

United States, and Missouri v. McNeely. The Jardines case involved a dog sniff at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house, with the Court ruling that it was a Fourth Amendment search. The Harris case dealt with the use of a drug-detection dog to establish probable cause for a search of a vehicle, while Bailey v. United States concerned the detention of an individual who had just left premises to be searched under warrant. Missouri v. McNeely addressed whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presented a per se exigency for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving cases. The Court held that it did not. The Jardines case relied on the \"property intrusion\" rationale rather than the \"expectation of privacy\" rationale used in past dog sniffing cases. The Florida Supreme Court had previously ruled that a dog sniff at the front door of a home constituted a search, and the Supreme Court's decision in Jardines affirmed this ruling. The Court's decision in Jones, which held that a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, may have influenced the decision in Jardines. The Court's decision in Bailey v. United States clarified that occupants must be taken into custody in the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched when officers seek to execute a search warrant.

A companion bill, S. 557, was introduced in the Senate. The proposed program is similar to a federal grant program that funds training and technical assistance for AMBER Alert systems. Each state has developed an AMBER Alert system to enlist the support of law enforcement agencies and the public in recovering children who are believed to have been abducted. In response to the increased congressional focus on alert systems for missing adults, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) gathered data on existing state alert systems in 11 states. CRS conducted a review of state laws, regulations, or executive orders that established the systems and contacted officials in the 11 states to learn more about how they are carried out. These systems were established beginning in 2006, and are administered by local and/or state law enforcement agencies. The systems are intended to alert law enforcement entities and/or the public that vulnerable adults are missing and may need assistance.

These programs support forest management and protection goals, including wildfire planning and response, and the development of wood products markets. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry assistance and research programs. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. Specific forestry assistance programs were authorized in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924 and later revised in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. Many of these programs are reexamined in farm bills, with the 2008 farm bill establishing national funding priorities and a standardized process for state assessments. The 2014 farm bill repealed several programs and reauthorized others, many of which are set to expire in 2018. Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS and implemented by state partners, with technical and financial aid provided to states for private landowner assistance. To be eligible for funds, states must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, consisting of a statewide assessment and a long-term strategy for addressing forest resource conditions and threats.

These ipsilateral motor deficits can emerge during the acute phase of stroke and persist chronically, but their causes are unclear. Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to detect these deficits, which have been identified in laboratory testing and in recent studies using specific motor tasks. Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, and the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions. Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor deficits, but a new study investigated the presence of both motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb using a tracking and reposition sense test. The study found that stroke patients had a lower accuracy index in the metacarpophalangeal (mp) joint and a higher score of reposition errors in the joint reposition test compared to sex- and age-matched normal subjects. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between the motor and sensory deficits, indicating that stroke patients would have difficulty performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions using pure integrity of movement accuracy and proprioceptive sense. The study suggests that ipsilateral sensory deficits may be connected with bilateral hemisphere activation during performance of motor tasks and that disturbance of transcallosal transfer after unilateral brain damage may lead to ipsilateral sensory deficits.

The lack of a clear association is surprising since diabetes is a disease of increased intracellular oxidative stress and accelerated biochemical aging. The use of insulin in the management of type 2 diabetes has raised concerns about promoting the growth of nascent malignancies. Recent studies have confirmed that type 2 diabetes confers increased risk for certain types of malignancies, including breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors. Many patients with type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin, and the long-acting insulin analogue, glargine, is one of the most commonly used agents. Several studies have demonstrated the potential mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of glargine on cultured cancer cells, but the clinical implications remain controversial. The question of whether glargine is associated with increased cancer risk compared with other commonly used forms of insulin is now at the forefront of the debate. Several studies have suggested a specific cancer risk associated with glargine, but other studies have not found an increased risk. Further research is needed to define the risk and explore the relationship between diabetes, insulin, insulin analogues and secretagogues, and cancer.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

Poor understanding of VVA among women and concerns about the efficacy, convenience, and safety of treatments emphasize the need for better communication between women and healthcare providers (HCPs). The Revive survey, conducted in 2012-2013, offers insights into the impact of VVA symptoms on women's lives. Many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its associated symptoms. Almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with an HCP.

MRI can be beneficial in cases of ventriculomegaly, which is characterized by an enlargement of the lateral ventricles, by providing additional information about the cause and severity of the condition. However, MRI has limitations such as the impact of fetal motion and lower spatial resolution compared to ultrasound. The interobserver agreement for both ultrasound and MRI can vary greatly, and the level of subspecialty training of the individuals interpreting the MRI examination can significantly improve the interobserver agreement. MRI can be useful in detecting small intraventricular hemorrhages, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cortical anomalies, and other malformations in cases of ventriculomegaly. The added value of MRI in assessing the size of the cerebral ventricles is limited, but it can be useful in detecting small foci of brain hemorrhage, callosal anomalies, and other abnormalities in fetuses diagnosed with cerebral ventriculomegaly. The use of fetal MRI in cases of ventriculomegaly is a topic of debate due to questions about its diagnostic accuracy, added value, and practical issues such as availability, cost, and expertise of fetal radiologists.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 6}}

Multiple factors contribute to glaucoma, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure. M\u00fcller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, support and nourish retinal neurons, maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, and are involved in synaptic transmission. Reactive M\u00fcller cells can aggravate retinal damage by releasing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-). Increased glial production of TNF- contributes to neurodegeneration in glaucoma. A six-carbon homolog of glutamate, -aminoadipic acid (AAA), induces specific glial toxicity by blocking glutamate uptake. The study aimed to determine if AAA treatment inhibits M\u00fcller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma. The results showed that AAA treatment attenuated gfap immunoreactivity in M\u00fcller cell processes across the inner plexiform layer (ipl) and reduced retinal TNF- levels in the rat model of AOH. The findings suggested that AAA promoted survival of RGCs in the rat model of AOH, likely through the inhibition of AOH-induced M\u00fcller cell gliosis and in turn downregulation of TNF- protein production. The observations suggested that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 9}}

Deflux has been FDA approved since 2001 for treating grade 2-4 VUR in single systems without accompanying urological malformations in children above one year of age. The ease of technique, short procedure and recovery time, and repeatability of injections have contributed to its popularity. However, success rates vary worldwide, with some studies reporting rates as low as 55%. A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent Dx/HA injections from 2005-2007 found an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection. Although success rates have improved, they still fall short of the traditional 98% for open reimplants. Parents should be advised that up to 25% of patients may have remaining VUR after Dx/HA injection, and voiding cystograms should be performed 2 months post-surgery. Intraoperative positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography has been developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) after a negative standard voiding cystogram. PIC cystography has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystogram and can detect occult VUR. In the current study, two different PIC techniques were compared, and it was found that PIC cystography performed intraoperatively immediately after Dx/HA injection could not predict a successful surgical outcome. A negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative vcug in only 80%, and the addition of intraoperative cystograms cannot replace postoperative studies.

Mastitis cows had a lower peak milk yield and attained peak yield earlier than normal cows. The parity-wise estimated lactation curve parameters for ftdmy indicated higher average initial milk yield in normal cows compared to mastitis cows in different parities. The peak milk yield was observed in the fourth parity, while the descending slope parameter was lower in the first parity and higher in the fourth parity in normal cows, but the opposite was true for mastitis cows. Higher persistency of lactation was observed in the first parity, which declined with an increase in parity order. The gamma type function showed a high score of goodness of fit, and approximately one-third of lactation curves were named atypical. The lactation curve parameters for ftdmy exhibited a similar trend in normal and mastitis infected cows, with a steeper decline in descending slope and increase in initial ftdmy due to a steeper rise in ascending slope from the first parity onwards serving as a marker of persistency during different parities in cows.

It consists of a pair of motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain. Myova's movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, amplified by the lever arms for processive motion. Lever arms consist of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required for Myova's ATPase activity, but high calcium concentrations reduce processivity and may cause one or more calmodulins to dissociate from each lever arm, reducing its flexural stiffness and efficiency. Myova is capable of maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Its structural flexibility allows the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search for actin track switching. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual Myova motors and their subdomains, revealing that the lever arms or the lever arm/coiled-coil junction may be critical to Myova's maneuverability.

The number of removed lymph nodes impacts the number of metastatic lymph nodes found. Lymph node ratio (LNR), the ratio of metastatic lymph nodes to removed lymph nodes, provides more useful prognostic information compared to nodal disease classification based on the number of metastatic lymph nodes. Studies have shown varying threshold values for clinically significant LNR, which depend on sampling size and tumor stage. Most LNR studies have been conducted on all lymph node-positive patients, without subdivision into n1, n2, and n3 disease groups. The LNR threshold value for prognostic significance is greater in series excluding n1 disease. Identifying separate LNR threshold values for each n disease group may be useful. Fortin et al. recommended axillary radiotherapy for specific LNR values in t1-t2 node-positive patients. A study investigating the prognostic value of LNR in patients with only n1 disease found that patients with 15 lymph nodes removed had a significantly higher axillary recurrence rate compared to those with 6 or more nodes removed. The most significant LNR threshold value for dfs, lrfs, and dmfs was 0.20, 0.30, and 0.15, respectively. LNR has independent prognostic significance for dfs and dmfs, while the number of removed lymph nodes does not have prognostic significance for dmfs.

High on-treatment platelet reactivity and low platelet inhibition during clopidogrel therapy are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, particularly stent thrombosis. Carriers of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and an increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting. Clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation, with the inactive prodrug being oxidized to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic CYP450 enzymes and then converted to the thiol metabolite. A recent study suggests that a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in this second step. A common polymorphism of PON1 (Q192R) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the QQ (AA) haplotype and has been linked to an increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients with coronary stenting.

Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. Melanoma can spread widely over the body through lymphatic and blood vessels, making early diagnosis crucial for prognosis. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic technique that can enhance morphological details of skin lesions, improving diagnostic sensitivity by up to 30%. However, its accuracy depends on the experience of the dermatologist. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to assist less experienced clinicians, but their effectiveness is limited by low within- and between-observer concordance. In recent years, there has been growing interest in automated analysis of digitized images obtained by dermoscopy techniques to differentiate early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Computational intelligence methods can help physicians and dermatologists in faster and more reliable diagnoses. Despite numerous computerized diagnostic systems reported in the literature, more research is needed to identify and reduce uncertainties in automatic decision support systems to improve diagnosis accuracy. A comprehensive up-to-date review of automatic diagnostic models for skin lesions is not available, necessitating a review of major classification algorithms and techniques for dermoscopic image analysis. This paper describes a standard automatic decision support system based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects commonly found in pigmented skin lesions. The review aims to summarize and compare advanced dermoscopic algorithms used for the classification of skin lesions and discuss important issues affecting the success of classification. The paper also provides a framework for selecting suitable algorithms needed for different steps of automatic diagnostic procedure for ensuring timely diagnosis of skin cancer. Performance evaluation measures and model validation details are presented for analyzing various algorithms/models and concluding comments are provided. Predictive models are used in medical domains for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with the data often preprocessed and expressed in a set of rules for statistical and machine learning models.

A patient with congenital toxoplasmosis and medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is described, with seizures beginning in early adulthood and increasing in frequency over time. Brain imaging revealed multifocal parenchymal calcifications, left hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and left amygdala hypertrophy, consistent with congenital toxoplasmosis. Ictal and interictal EEG monitoring, SPECT, and FDG-PET confirmed the presence of MTLE. The patient underwent left anteromesial temporal resection, including the calcified lesion, to achieve seizure control. The distribution and severity of calcifications in congenital toxoplasmosis can vary, and their presence may be associated with neurologic signs and symptoms.

VEGF-C, which is expressed in many human cancers and promotes tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, is a potential alternative ligand for VEGFR-2 and a viable target for anti-cancer therapy in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs.

The study found that serum level of L-fucose cannot be correlated with age and gender, but there is a negative correlation between serum fucose levels and histopathological tumor differentiation. The mean serum value of L-fucose in the cancer group (10.85 mg/dl) and control group (3.47 mg/dl) shows a wide margin of difference (7.38 mg/dl).

{"idx": 713, "result": 0, "generated": " Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders that affect adrenal enzymes, causing altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent CAH variant, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), is caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2). This deficiency leads to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in adrenal gland hyperplasia and increased androgen production. There are different clinical forms of CAH associated with 21-OHD, including classical CAH (salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and non-classical CAH. Treatment of CAH involves glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement to prevent adrenal crises and suppress abnormal androgen and steroid precursor secretion. However, conventional glucocorticoid replacement may not mimic natural cortisol rhythms, leading to over- or under-suppression and related complications. A study of 26 CAH patients due to 21-OHD in Tunisia found that 42.3% showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities and temporal lobe atrophy. These abnormalities may be due to hormonal imbalances during early development and exposure to excess exogenous glucocorticoids.

The actuator device, composed of a microboard and a set of six PVDF actuators, was programmed to apply a square wave of 5V at 1Hz and 3Hz for 15 minutes once every 24 hours. The device was implanted in the left hind limb of a sheep, and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb. Postoperative X-ray images were obtained to ensure the proper evolution of the bone cuts and to detect signs of infection/inflammation. Bone samples were cut transversally to the long axis of the bone and included a piezoelectric film and the surrounding bone. Soft tissues were routinely processed and embedded in paraffin. Undecalcified bone samples of each of the implants were included in resin according to the manufacturer's instructions and 80m thick sections cut with a saw microtome parallel to the piezoelectric film long axis. Sections were then appropriately processed for routine staining, mounted for fluorescence microscopy, and analyzed using histomorphometric studies. The results showed that total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher compared to static controls, and the increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation. The mineral apposition rate was significantly higher around actuated devices than around static devices. A fibrous capsule was obvious both in actuators and static devices, with no statistical significant differences in capsule thickness between the two groups. Immunohistochemistry failed to detect differences in TRAP expression between the two groups, but there is a marked elevation in OPN detection around actuators. The increased OPN expression is most likely associated with mechanical stress, and it was not accompanied by a proportional increase in TRAP.

To make full use of the genomic data, biologists need to become skilled at navigating the vast expanses of genomic DNA and adopting universal vocabularies.\n3. There are two common ways of annotating (assigning names and functions to) genes: one based on experimental observations and the other on predicted evolutionary relationships.\n4. Homologous genes have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions, providing clues for predicting the functions of all genes.\n5. However, homology is based on evolution, not function, so homology assignment only indicates an approximate direction for future empirical determination of function.\n6. The first completely sequenced genomes were annotated based on searches of all available sequence databases, but this approach has limitations when it comes to sequence-similar, homologous portions of genes embedded in otherwise sequence-dissimilar, non-homologous contexts.\n7. Domains, homologous portions of sequences that are encoded in different gene contexts, represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution.\n8.

The follow-up period was 1.7\u00b11.4 years, and 48 patients underwent major amputations and 89 died. The leading cause of death was cardiac and vascular disease. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared with nondiabetic patients, whereas they had a similar life prognosis. The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, and the adjusted HR was 3.101 (95% CI 1.262-7.621) (p=0.014). Mortality was associated with age, impaired ADLs, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.

EETs are derived from arachidonic acid via metabolism by cytochromes P450, particularly members of the 2c and 2j families. The ratio and stereocomposition of EET isomers depend on the specific cytochrome P450 isoform, making them species- and tissue-specific. However, the stability and potential therapeutic utility of EETs are limited by various chemical and metabolic factors, including their susceptibility to aerial and auto-oxidation, and inactivating enzymatic processes such as esterification, metabolism by other pathways of the arachidonate cascade, conjugation, -oxidation, chain elongation, and hydrolysis of the epoxide. In biological milieu, hydration of the epoxide by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a major determinant of EET steady-state levels, whose half-life is estimated to be seconds to minutes. Inhibition of sEH has been shown to elevate EET levels both in vitro and in vivo, offering a potential strategy for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes. However, this approach might be less effective than agonist replacement therapy when endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised due to disease, inflammation, radiotherapy, aging, or exposure to xenobiotics and drugs that inhibit cytochromes P450. To address some of the stability limitations of natural EETs, researchers have prepared several iterations of EET surrogates with improved stability, which were evaluated for relaxation of precontracted bovine coronary artery rings and in vitro inhibition of recombinant human sEH.

In RA, SAA can impair the protective function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and may be associated with cardiovascular disease. SAA is also the precursor of amyloid A protein, which can lead to organ failure and premature death in secondary amyloidosis. A study of 140 RA patients found that SAA concentration was high in the majority of patients and was significantly associated with disease activity, inflammatory markers, and unfavorable lipid parameters. Women treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had significantly lower SAA concentration than women treated only with synthetic DMARDs. The study suggests that SAA could be considered as a biomarker associated with both current inflammatory disease activity and chronic complications, including the risk of cardiovascular and renal involvement in RA patients. Persistently elevated SAA concentration increases the risk of amyloidosis development due to deposition of amyloid proteins in different tissues and organs. The correlation between SAA and RA activity has been reported in literature, and SAA may play a pathogenic role locally in joint destruction and cartilage damage. Further prospective determinations of SAA are necessary to define an accurate answer regarding its role as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in RA.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

The results showed that propofol at 2 and 4 mg/kg significantly increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol, while significantly decreasing the levels of HDL-cholesterol. The increased cholesterol level may be linked to an increase in alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, while the increased triglycerides levels may be due to increased availability of free fatty acid, glycerophosphates, decreased triglycerides lipase activity, or decreased fatty oxidation. Propofol also increased the levels of hepatic glutathione and the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. However, there were no significant differences in the activities of renal and hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase in propofol-treated rats relative to controls.

A mixed plant community is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation, and modeling can help resolve important management and ecological questions by allowing comparisons that are not possible in the field. The goal of the project described is to estimate how frequently native perennial warm-season grasses may be established in southern Arizona using 31 years of historical rainfall event data. Researching the likelihood of vegetation establishment is important for better developing mitigation strategies and allowing appropriate budgeting for them.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

The SPIO's superparamagnetic nature, nonlinear magnetization curve, and ability to be magnetically saturated make it possible to visualize and quantify the spatial distribution of SPIO, providing high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. MPI could be used in cardiovascular imaging and interventions, allowing visualization and quantification of vascular pathologies and determination of functional parameters in one examination. However, the development of suitable MPI scanners and appropriate tracer material is necessary. The circulation time of SPIO in blood is mainly determined by their overall hydrodynamic diameter, which is influenced by the coatings. Resovist, an approved T2* contrast agent for MRI, is the most important benchmark material for MPI, but its hydrodynamic diameter is greater than 50 nm, limiting its in vivo distribution. The pharmacokinetics of Resovist, especially its half-life in blood, are important for cardiovascular MPI. The study aimed to evaluate the blood half-life of MPI using Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS), as it may differ significantly from the blood half-life in MRI. The study used two different versions of Resovist, distributed by Bayer Pharma AG in Europe and Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in Japan, and administered it into the ear artery of ten female New Zealand White rabbits. The MPI signal was evaluated using MPS, which measures the remagnetization spectrum of SPIO. The study found that the average MPI signal in blood declined to 30% of the baseline signal 5 minutes after injection, and within 30 minutes, the MPI signal was below the noise level of the MPS. The signal for Resovist from Bayer Pharma AG decreased to 39.7% of baseline after 5 minutes, while the signal for Resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co Ltd showed a rapid decrease to 20.4% of the baseline signal after 5 minutes.

PHAs are synthesized when carbon is available but other essential nutrients are scarce, and are divided into short-chain-length (SCL) and medium-chain-length (MCL) groups. The surface of PHA granules is coated with phospholipids and proteins, and the type of PHA produced depends on the metabolic pathway of the microorganism. PHA synthases, which play a major role in PHA synthesis, are classified into four classes based on substrate specificities and subunits organization. Extremophiles in polar areas are a source of novel PHA-synthesizing enzymes with industrial potential. A study was conducted to determine whether bacteria in freshwater reservoirs in glacier forefield areas have the potential to synthesize PHAs. Samples were collected from five reservoirs and one stream, and 50 bacterial isolates were characterized by sequencing a 1000 bp long fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. The isolated strains mainly belonged to the phylum of proteobacteria and represented classes beta, gamma, and alpha proteobacteria, as well as two isolates belonging to the bacteroidetes phylum. The most frequently recovered group of isolates was members of the pseudomonas genus. In order to detect microorganisms producing PHAs, PCR was performed with two primer pairs, and the results showed that six pseudomonas strains and two janthinobacterium strains possessed genes responsible for MCL-PHA synthesis. The study suggests that PHA metabolism in antarctic strains could be an adaptation mechanism to withstand harsh conditions in polar regions, and that microbial mats created in antarctic ponds could be a potential source of PHA producing bacteria. </summary>", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of mRNAs through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RNAi can also modulate gene transcription and induce epigenetic changes. In fission yeast, RISC homologs regulate chromatin by recruiting histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNA. Promoter-targeted RNAs can repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells. In human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAA), which has been conserved in other mammalian species. SARNAs, promoter-targeted small hairpin RNAs, have been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo by targeting antisense transcripts for degradation, resulting in a reversal of epigenetic silencing and upregulation of sense mRNA. A genomic bioinformatic approach was used to design SARNAs that specifically target two key reprogramming genes, KLF4 and MYC. These SARNAs were tested for their ability to upregulate the targeted reprogramming factors and their respective downstream genes in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The effects of SARNA transfection on endogenous gene expression profiles were compared with those resulting from lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the exogenous Klf4 and c-Myc transgenes.

In this study, HPV igg antibodies were detected in serum samples from 42.9% of women, indicating that the women had been infected and that the virus is circulating with a high prevalence in Kaduna state. The study recommends improving knowledge at the population level by education on the mode of transmission of the virus and the risks associated with the virus as a cause of cervical cancer. In addition, cervical cancer screening programs need to be put in place in Nigeria, given that cervical cancer has been shown to disproportionately affect African American women, who are nearly twice more likely than European American women to die of the disease.", "format_properties": {"n_sentences": 7}}

It is a major cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI) in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Genome sequencing and comparative analysis can provide insights into the pathogenicity, evolution history, and cell-host interaction of HMPV. The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb in length, with a gene composition of n-p-m-f-m2-1/m2-2-sh-g-l. Its genomic organization is similar to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), lacking two nonstructural genes, ns1 and ns2. HMPV has two main genetic lineages, subtype A and B, which further divide into subgroups a1/a2 and b1/b2. The a2 sublineage exhibits the greatest diversity among all sublineages. Synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV can offer insights into its evolution profile, gene expression, and virus-host interaction. A study of 17 complete HMPV genomes revealed that preferred codons in HMPV are ended with a/u, suggesting a strong synonymous codon usage bias influenced by the nucleotide composition in its genomes. The g+c content of the HMPV genome is 36.91%, and over 68.57% of codons are ended with a/u. Natural selection and mutation pressure are key factors affecting codon usage patterns in organisms, and in HMPV, mutation pressure rather than natural selection is the most important determinant of codon usage. Codon usage bias in HMPV shows distinct differences among different phylogenetic types, suggesting its role in HMPV's evolution history. HMPV shows a complementary trend with human cells in codon usage, which may contribute to its persistent infection in the human environment and understanding cell-host interaction and viral evolution.\n</summary>\n\nNote: The summary is concise and covers the main points of the source document.

In cancer, miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, with some being overexpressed and others lost, often localizing to fragile sites.\n3. Differences in miRNA expression profiles have been documented in normal compared to cancerous tissue of the endometrium, breast, and ovary.\n4. miRNAs can affect the expression of a large number of proteins, including those involved in pathways relevant to cancer, such as apoptosis, migration, and metastasis.\n5. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal process during development, but is also used by cancer cells to become more motile and metastatic.\n6. EMT involves reprogramming of the cells by transcription factors such as Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist, Snail, and Slug, leading to loss of E-cadherin expression, loss of polarity, acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and increased motility.\n7. The miR-200 family, which contains five members, has been implicated in the process of EMT. Members of this family can repress both Zeb1 and Zeb2, leading to upregulation of E-cadherin.\n8.

{"idx": 799, "result": 0, "generated": " The transobturator approach to treat female stress urinary incontinence by placing a midurethral sling (MUS) was first described by Delorme as an alternative to the retropubic approach to reduce complications. Two variations of the transobturator approach are the outside-in and inside-out methods. A meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the three most common surgical approaches for stress urinary incontinence, including the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches in relation to neurovascular structures, but traditional anatomical dissections do not allow for the study of the MUS's configuration in relation to the urethra. A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis. The study found that the out-in MUS had a larger full inner angle (144 degrees) compared to the in-out MUS (122 degrees) in a strict antero-posterior view. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning provided a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory. This technique can be applied to different types of non radio-opaque implants, allowing for a better spatial understanding of the anatomical position within the pelvis. The study also found that both obturator MUS approaches were demonstrated to be u-shaped bands that head backwards or dorsally, and the tape is not positioned caudally but lies as a band behind the urethra, suggestive of its passive (non-obstructive) role in achieving continence. The clinical implications from this cadaveric imaging study are that surgeons must pay more attention to the second half of the helical pass, whichever way they chose to go. The advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography will allow for similar measurements of the different tapes trajectories in vivo in a dynamic setting, possibly allowing correlation of these findings to nuances in clinical outcomes.
