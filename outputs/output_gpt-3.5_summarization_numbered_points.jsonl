Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries with a white dwarf primary and a low mass main sequence secondary that transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point.\n2. The orbital period distribution of CVs shows a lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range and a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce accurately.\n3. The minimum orbital period of CVs is influenced by mass transfer rate and thermal equilibrium effects, with the position of the minimum period affected by assumed parameters.\n4. Various mechanisms, such as consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) and donor star deformation, have been explored to increase the minimum period and hide the predicted period spike in CV populations.\n5. Models incorporating a range of CAML efficiencies or intrinsic deformation factors in donor stars show varying success in fitting the observed CV period distribution, with no definitive solution to the period minimum and spike problems.\n6.

The idea of using spin polarization of a single electron to encode binary information was first mentioned by Feynman in 1985, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates were not developed until the mid-1990s.\n2. Encoding information in spin offers advantages such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and potentially faster operation compared to charge-based devices.\n3. A concrete scheme for a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field was proposed in 1994.\n4. The use of exchange interaction between spins in quantum dots allows for the creation of logic gates, but bidirectional exchange interaction poses challenges for unidirectional logic signal propagation.\n5. Multi-phase clocking was proposed as a solution to enforce unidirectionality in spin-based logic devices, but it presents challenges in practical implementation.\n6. Spin-based logic gates dissipate a significant amount of energy per bit flip, making them less practical for real-world applications.\n7. Reversible logic gates using exchange-coupled spins have been proposed as a solution to overcome energy dissipation challenges in spin-based computing.\n8.

Entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed experimentally, where entanglement of qubits can be terminated in a finite time despite the coherence of single qubit losing asymptotically.\n3. Some studies have shown that entanglement can revive after ESD, and in some cases, finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long term.\n4. The lost entanglement of qubits is transferred exclusively to the reservoirs under markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD of qubits is always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.\n5. The entanglement dynamics in a system of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs show invariance in entanglement distribution among bipartite subsystems.\n6. The distribution of entanglement among bipartite subsystems is dependent on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.\n7. The entanglement can be stably distributed among all bipartite subsystems if the qubit and its reservoir can form a bound state and the non-markovian effect is important.\n8. The entanglement distribution is determined by the time-dependent factor of single-qubit excited-state population, leading to sudden death/birth of entanglement.\n9.

LCN2 mice show increased insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and reduced adiponectin levels under HFD conditions.\n4. LCN2 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, adaptive thermoregulation, and the development of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.\n5. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity is reduced in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of LCN2 mice, contributing to decreased thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure.\n6. LCN2 deficiency leads to systemic insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, and altered lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and liver.\n7.
