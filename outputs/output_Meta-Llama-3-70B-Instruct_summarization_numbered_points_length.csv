1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems are not well understood, and ratchet systems are a particular area of interest. Ratchets are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport. The origins of interest in ratchets lie in extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as seen in biological systems. Recently, attention has focused on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.

2. Chaotic systems are defined as those that are sensitively dependent on initial conditions, and their behavior is generally sensitively dependent on system parameters. The phase-space structure of nonlinear systems is usually complicated, consisting of stability islands and chaotic seas. This structure can change significantly as parameters change, leading to dramatic changes in transport properties. The behavior of nonlinear systems is often characterized by bifurcations, which are sudden changes in the system's behavior.

3. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the current, or directed transport, could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. Mateos conjectured a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior. However, Barbi and Salerno later argued that this conjecture was not universally valid. They proposed an alternative origin for current reversals, related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.

4. The current study aims to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets by considering specific systems in great detail. The approach taken is to discover heuristic rules by studying specific systems before generalizing. The system considered is a 1-dimensional ratchet with an asymmetric periodic potential, driven by a periodic time-dependent external force. The equations of motion for an individual trajectory are given, and the bifurcation diagram is constructed by iterating an initial condition and recording the particle's position at discrete times.

5. The current, or net transport, is defined as the time-average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions. The current depends on the shape and location of the ensemble being used, and it is important to consider many different initial conditions to generate a current. The transport properties of an ensemble in a chaotic system depend on the part of the phase-space being sampled. The location and width of the initial ensemble also affect the details of the current.

6. The results of the study show that a single trajectory can display behavior very different from that of many trajectories, especially in the chaotic regime. The current is less likely to depend significantly on the",0

1. The study examines six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems, including HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B.
2. The systems were chosen based on their high eccentricities and the presence of a single planet in each system.
3. The study combines radial velocity data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) with previously published data to search for additional planets in these systems.
4. No evidence of additional planets was found in any of the six systems.
5. Test particle simulations were used to determine the regions where additional planets could exist in stable orbits.
6. The simulations showed that there are regions where additional objects can exist, including protected resonances in the HD 3651 and HD 37605 systems.
7. Combining the simulations with detection limits computed using the new HET data, the study was able to rule out additional short-period planets down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions of the HD 3651 and HD 45350 systems.
8. The study highlights the importance of combining radial velocity data with dynamical simulations to understand the architecture of extrasolar planetary systems.
9. The results of the study provide new insights into the formation and evolution of highly eccentric planetary systems.",1

1. The LEP experiments have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the decay of the Z-boson into fermion pairs with high accuracy. The next generation Z-factory, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC), will further test the SM and potentially discover new physics beyond the SM. The ILC will operate at the Z-pole, allowing for the generation of a large number of Z-boson events.

2. The rare Z-decays, such as Z → h0f fbar, are sensitive to new physics and can be used to probe the properties of the Higgs boson. The decay Z → h0bb is of particular interest, as it is sensitive to the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to bottom quarks. The branching ratio of this decay can be enhanced in new physics models, such as the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) and the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM).

3. The 2HDM and NMSSM predict additional Higgs bosons, which can mix with the SM-like Higgs boson and affect its properties. The couplings of the Higgs bosons to fermions and gauge bosons are also modified in these models. The 2HDM has two Higgs doublets, which can lead to flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) at tree level.

4. The NMSSM is a supersymmetric extension of the SM, which predicts the existence of sparticles, such as neutralinos and charginos. The NMSSM has a richer Higgs sector than the 2HDM, with three CP-even Higgs bosons and two CP-odd Higgs bosons. The lightest CP-odd Higgs boson, h0, can be very light and have significant couplings to fermions.

5. The constraints on the 2HDM and NMSSM come from various sources, including the LEP search for Higgs bosons, the precision electroweak observables, and the flavor physics observables. The constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the dark matter relic density are also important. The 2HDM and NMSSM parameters are scanned randomly to satisfy these constraints.

6. The scans are performed over the parameter space of the 2HDM, L2HDM, NMSSM, and NMSSM, respectively. The parameters",0

1. The no-scale supersymmetry (SUSY) scenario is a highly predictive and attractive extension of the Standard Model, which solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. In this scenario, the SUSY breaking masses of scalars are determined by the Kähler potential, and the only source of SUSY breaking is gaugino masses. The no-scale scenario is realized in various SUSY models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and five-dimensional setting with two branes.

2. The authors investigate the implications of the current Higgs mass and B(s) → μ+μ- constraint on SUSY models with the no-scale boundary condition. They consider three cases: universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale, and non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale. The authors find that the Higgs mass bound and B(s) → μ+μ- constraint are important in constraining the parameter space of these models.

3. In the minimal case with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, the authors find that the Higgs mass bound and B(s) → μ+μ- constraint exclude almost all the parameter region, leaving a very narrow allowed region. In the case of universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale, the authors find that the constraint is not severe, and the Tevatron has a chance to observe SUSY signatures like trilepton events.

4. In the case of non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, the authors find that the Higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino-like neutralino LSP case, and the mass of the higgsino-like neutralino must be larger than about 245 GeV and 370 GeV for μ > 0 and μ < 0, respectively. In the wino-like neutralino LSP and sneutrino LSP cases, the mass of the LSP can be as small as 150 GeV, but the mass difference between the LSP and parent particles produced at the collider is much smaller than in the minimal case.",0

1. The paper discusses the stability of quasiregular (qr) singularities in the cross-polarized Bell-Szekeres (cpbs) spacetime, which is a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations.
2. The authors apply the Hellaby-Konkowski (hk) stability conjecture to test the stability of qr singularities in the cpbs spacetime.
3. The conjecture predicts that qr singularities are unstable and transform into scalar curvature singularities when generic waves are added.
4. The authors use three types of test fields to probe the stability of qr singularities: test electromagnetic field, test scalar field, and test null dusts.
5. The analysis shows that the qr singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable according to the conjecture and transforms into a non-scalar curvature singularity.
6. The authors construct an exact back-reaction solution to the test scalar field in the cpbs spacetime, which represents the collision of cross-polarized electromagnetic field coupled to a scalar field.
7. The solution shows that the weyl and Maxwell scalars diverge as the singularity is approached, confirming the prediction of the conjecture.
8. The authors also introduce test null dusts into the interaction region of the cpbs spacetime and find that the conjecture predicts the correct nature of the singularity formed.
9. The paper concludes that the hk stability conjecture is valid for the cpbs spacetime, and the qr singularities in the incoming region are unstable and transform into scalar curvature singularities when generic waves are added.",1

1. The study focuses on the X-ray properties of normal galaxies, specifically spiral galaxies, at cosmologically interesting distances. The Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) survey has reached depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies. The study aims to constrain models of X-ray binary production in galaxies. The X-ray luminosity per unit B-band luminosity is an indicator of the current level of star formation in a galaxy.

2. The sample consists of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from Cohen et al. (2000) and photometric redshifts from Fernández-Soto et al. (1999). The galaxies were filtered by optical luminosity and morphology to select spiral galaxies. The sample was divided into redshift bins to study the evolution of X-ray properties with redshift. The number of galaxies, median redshift, and median look-back time for each bin are listed in Table 1.

3. The X-ray imaging data were stacked at each position, and the detection significance was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. Significant detections were found in the soft band for all redshift bins up to z=1.3. The flux level of the soft-band detections is (5.6±1.3) x 10^(-17) erg s^(-1) cm^(-2). The corresponding rest-frame 0.5-2 keV luminosities for the average galaxy are 1.4 x 10^(40) erg s^(-1) for the lowest redshift bin and 2.5 x 10^(40) erg s^(-1) for the highest redshift bin.

4. The individually detected galaxies were found to have higher X-ray luminosities than the stacked galaxies. The X-ray luminosity of the individually detected galaxies is on average much higher than that of the stacked galaxies. The radio properties of the individually detected galaxies and the stacked galaxies were also compared. The percentage of radio detections among the individually X-ray detected galaxies is higher than that among the stacked galaxies.

5. The X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio (L_X/L_B) was plotted for each stacked detection. The average L_X/L_B for spiral galaxies of comparable B-band luminosity from the Shapley et al. (2001) sample was plotted for comparison. The results suggest that the average X-ray luminosity of galaxies has not evolved upward by more than a factor of 2.3 by z=1.3, regardless of exclusion or inclusion of X-ray",0

1. Quantum systems can be correlated in ways that surpass classical descriptions, and there are degrees of non-classicality for quantum correlations. The weaker end of the spectrum includes non-separable or entangled states, while the strongest end includes Bell-nonlocal states. Bell-nonlocality is the only way to verify entanglement if either party or their detectors cannot be trusted.

2. The paper investigates EPR-steerability of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, known as T-states. The authors use the steering ellipsoid formalism to develop a deterministic LHV model for projective measurements on these states and conjecture that this model is optimal. They also obtain two sufficient conditions for T-states to be EPR-steerable.

3. A bipartite state is Bell-local if and only if there is a local hidden variable (LHV) model for any measurements Alice and Bob perform. A state is EPR-steerable if it allows for correlations that demonstrate EPR-steering. The set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-EPR-steerable states.

4. The paper reviews the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism, which describes the set of steered Bloch vectors for a given two-qubit state. The ellipsoid has a centre and semiaxes that are the roots of the eigenvalues of a certain matrix. The general equation of the ellipsoid surface is given, and it is shown that the volume of the ellipsoid is strictly bounded for separable states.

5. The authors consider measurement by Alice of hermitian observables on her qubit and show that the probability of result 'a' and the corresponding steered Bloch vector are given by certain equations. They assume a particular form for the probability distribution and show that this leads to a deterministic LHV model for Bob.

6. The authors find a remarkable connection between the equation of the steering ellipsoid and the EPR-steerability of T-states. They show that a necessary condition for EPR-steerability is that the T-state corresponds to a point above a certain surface in the space of possible correlation matrices.

7. The authors give two sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability, one based on a new EPR-steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix and the other on a known nonlinear EPR-steering inequality. Both conditions are asymmetric under the interchange of Alice and Bob's roles.

8. The authors apply their sufficient conditions to T-states and show that they are relatively strong.",0

1. The concept of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information was first proposed in the mid-1980s, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates did not emerge until the mid-1990s.
2. Encoding information in spin may offer advantages over charge-based devices, including lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and potentially faster operation.
3. In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field was proposed, which was later extensively studied by others using time-independent simulations.
4. However, these devices have a severe shortcoming that prevents their use in pipelined architectures, as the exchange interaction between spins can lead to metastable states that prevent the logic signal from propagating.
5. To overcome this issue, a three-phase clocking scheme was proposed, which allows the input state to propagate through a linear array of cells, but this solution is not practical due to the need for gate pads between every two cells.
6. The use of spin in classical irreversible logic gates is limited by the Landauer limit, which sets a minimum energy dissipation per bit flip, making them less efficient than traditional computing architectures.
7. Reversible logic gates and quantum computing using spin-based qubits have been proposed as a way to circumvent these limitations, with recent experimental progress made in demonstrating coherent transfer of electron spins between quantum dots and reading out qubits optically.",1

1. The paper investigates the period minimum problem in cataclysmic variables (CVs), which is the discrepancy between the observed and theoretical minimum orbital period of CVs. The authors explore ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and introducing a consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) mechanism. They find that even a maximal efficient CAML mechanism cannot increase the bounce period sufficiently. The real CV population is likely to comprise systems with a range of CAML efficiencies, resulting in a distribution of systems down to the theoretical minimum period.

2. The authors also consider donor stars that are ""bloated"" due to intrinsic effects, such as tidal deformation found in 3D simulations of Roche-lobe filling stars. An implausibly large deformation factor of around 1.18 is needed to obtain a bounce period of 77 minutes. A possible alternative identification of the period minimum as an age limit rather than a period bounce would limit the donor mass in any CV in a CV population dominated by hydrogen-rich, unevolved systems. This would imply that systems with donor mass much less than this would either have an orbital period less than 78 minutes or would have already evolved beyond the period minimum.

3. The authors synthesize model populations to test the ""goodness"" of fit against the observed sample using a modified χ² test. They find that none of their synthesized model populations fits as well as the distribution which is simply flat in orbital period. Models designed to ""wash out"" the period spike by introducing a large spread of the CAML efficiency do generally better than population models based on donor stars that are subject to a large spread of intrinsic deformation factors. The authors conclude that the period minimum problem and the period spike problem remain an open issue.",1

1. The Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group of galaxies that has undergone a complex sequence of interactions and harassment, resulting in a highly disturbed intragroup medium. The group has a large-scale intergalactic shock wave, first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum and later detected in X-ray emission.

2. The shock wave is believed to be responsible for the heating of the X-ray emitting gas, and the high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the intergalactic medium of the group is thought to be the cause of the shock heating. Optical emission line ratios and broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks and not star formation.

3. The Spitzer Space Telescope was used to obtain mid-infrared spectroscopy of the shock region in SQ, which revealed powerful, pure rotational H2 line emission. The emission is widespread, running north-south along the shock ridge and along a ""bridge"" structure that is faint in X-ray and radio continuum images.

4. The H2 emission is closely associated with the X-ray and radio emission, but there are subtle differences in their distributions. The cooler H2 lines are concentrated towards the north of the shock, while the warmer lines are more closely correlated with the X-ray emission.

5. Fine-structure lines, such as [FeII] and [SiIII], are also detected in the shock region, and their distributions are anti-correlated with each other. The [SiIII] line is a strong coolant of X-ray-irradiated gas and is predicted to be one of the top four cooling lines under these circumstances.

6. The dust, PAH, and UV emission in SQ are associated with previously known star-forming regions, and there is little evidence of triggered star formation in the molecular gas associated with the shock-excited H2. The faint 24 μm emission from the shock ridge may be due to the destruction of very small grains or the presence of cold dust.

7. The total H2 line luminosity from the main shock is estimated to be 9.7 × 10^40 ergs s^-1, which dwarfs the luminosity of the next brightest mid-IR line, [SiIII] 34.82 μm, by a factor of ten. The excitation diagram of the low-j 0-0 H2 transitions for the main shock extraction is well fit by a model including three temperature components.",1

1. The paper explores the role of marginally gravitationally unstable (mgu) disks in the early solar system, focusing on the transport and mixing of short-lived radioisotopes and stable oxygen isotopes.
2. The authors use three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model the evolution of mgu disks with various masses, temperatures, and injection radii, and find that the disks can efficiently mix and transport material over large distances.
3. The results suggest that mgu disk phases can explain the observed homogeneity of short-lived radioisotopes in the early solar system, as well as the range of stable oxygen isotope ratios found in refractory particles from comet 81P/Wild 2.
4. The authors also explore the implications of mgu disk phases for the habitability of planetary systems around low-mass stars, including M dwarfs, and find that these systems may experience similar evolutions to the solar nebula.
5. The simulations show that the degree of homogenization of isotopes in the disk depends on whether the injection occurs in a single shot or continuously, with continuous injection leading to higher dispersions.
6. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the early solar system's evolution and the potential for life in planetary systems around low-mass stars.",1

1. The universe's accelerated expansion was first observed through the faintness of type Ia supernovae, and this observation has been confirmed by multiple independent experiments.
2. The acceleration is thought to be driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, known as dark energy (DE), within the framework of general relativity.
3. The nature of DE remains unknown, and its properties are still being researched, with many theories attempting to explain its origin and behavior.
4. The current cosmological model, known as ΛCDM, is not entirely satisfactory, as it requires a fine-tuning of the cosmological constant and does not fully explain the coincidence problem.
5. Interacting dark matter (DM) and DE models have been proposed to alleviate the coincidence problem and provide a more complete understanding of the universe's evolution.
6. Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and large-scale structure have constrained the properties of DE and DM, but more data is needed to fully understand their interactions.
7. Future surveys, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will provide more precise measurements of the universe's expansion history and the growth of structure.
8. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) have already provided high-resolution CMB maps, and future experiments like CMB-S4 will further constrain cosmological models.

1. The study examines the claim of a systematic redshift of FeII emission relative to [OIII]5007 and broad Hβ emission in type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The authors investigate this claim using a sample of bright SDSS quasars and find no evidence for a systematic FeII redshift. They suggest that the accuracy of FeII shift measures depends on FeII strength, spectral S/N, and the strength of HeII 4686 emission. The authors also find that individual source spectra with large quoted FeII redshifts and S/N near the sample median cannot distinguish between zero and large redshifts.

2. The authors generate high S/N composite spectra to test the FeII shift hypothesis and find no significant shift between FeII and the rest frame or between FeII and Hβ. They also do not find any significant FeII shifts if they restrict to sources with a low Eddington ratio. The authors suggest that the claim of large FeII redshifts is not confirmed and that the effect of HeII 4686 emission may have driven the conclusion of a systematic FeII redshift. They test this conclusion by omitting HeII from their fits and find that the FeII shifts increase, suggesting that HeII can produce the entire systematic redshift claimed.

3. The authors analyze the FeII shift composites using the 4DE1 formalism and find that the fits are not significantly different from zero. They also find that the significance of χ² variations is described by F-statistics, and any χ² differences between two fits become significant at a 95% confidence level if F > 1. The authors conclude that zero shift and ""best shift"" values are not significantly different, and all fits involving shifts > 500 km/s are statistically significant. They also find that the fits to the 4430-4680 blue blend drive the best-fit χ² results.

4. The authors conclude that they do not confirm large FeII redshifts relative to narrow [OIII] and broad Hβ emission in type 1 AGN, but cannot rule out the existence of small red (or blue) shifts in particular subsamples. They suggest that small systematic shifts of FeII with respect to the rest frame seem plausible, but a reliable analysis is possible only on spectra of high S/N ratio. The authors also challenge the usefulness of FeII shift as an orientation parameter.",0

1. Nuclear multifragmentation is a topic of intense study, with researchers searching for signs of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. Theoretical calculations began in the 1980s, while the first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the ALADIN group. The curve showed a wide plateau at around 5 MeV temperature, suggesting a possible liquid-gas phase transition. This finding motivated further theoretical and experimental work.

2. Subsequent experiments by EOS and INDRA groups obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region absent in most cases. The discrepancies were attributed to the precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve. The ALADIN group reevaluated their data, correcting the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons by about 10%. The energies of spectator parts were found to increase with bombarding energy.

3. The universality of a certain quantity subject to bombarding energy variation suggests that the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same for different reactions. However, the measured source excitation energies contain a significant nonequilibrium part, which may belong to pre-equilibrium or pre-break-up stages. SMM calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even at 600 MeV/nucleon bombarding energy. Accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and sequential secondary particle emission are necessary to distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts.

4. The microcanonical multifragmentation model was refined to improve the primary break-up part and include secondary particle emission. The model's improvements concern both the break-up stage and secondary particle emission. The experimental discrete energy levels replaced the level density for fragments with A ≤ 10. The level density formula was modified to account for the strong decrease of fragments' excited states lifetime with increasing excitation energy.

5. The sequential evaporation process was simulated using standard Monte Carlo methods. The microcanonical weight formulas have the usual form, except that the level density functions are replaced by discrete levels degeneracies. The break-up channels are countable, and a classical Monte Carlo simulation is appropriate when a mean field approach is used for the Coulomb interaction energy. The Wigner-Seitz approach was employed for the Coulomb interaction.

1. The quiet solar corona is heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins, while the visible surface of the sun is roughly 250 times cooler. This phenomenon has been well known for over 60 years, and it is believed that magnetic fields or waves play a key role in the heating process. The primary energy source for this heating lies in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.

2. The debate centers on whether the energy to heat the corona derives from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events giving rise to nanoflares. The interaction of the magnetic field with convective flows in or below the photosphere can produce two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures. These disturbances can generate MHD waves or field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.

3. The main difference between these processes is that plasma inertia plays a key role in wave propagation, but is unimportant for the dynamics of field-aligned currents along coronal loops. Theoretical arguments exist for both mechanisms, but the observational evidence for nano-flare heating is less convincing. Extrapolation of the number spectra of small flares down to microflares has been made to nano-flares, but the total energy is probably less than the required amount.

4. High-frequency MHD waves are capable of significant heating, and these waves have been sought using the Fe XIV green line at 530.3 nm and the Fe X red line at 637.5 nm. Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of coronal structures have been made by several researchers using different instruments. The results of these investigations are somewhat contradictory, with both positive and negative observations of oscillations.

5. The authors describe a set-up that will be used to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations using the mid-sized coronagraph at Lomnicky Peak Observatory. The observations will be made in the Fe XIV green line using the SECIS instrument, which consists of two fast-frame-rate CCD cameras, auxiliary electronics systems, and a dedicated computer. The observational system consists of three main instrumental parts: the 20-cm Lyot-type coronagraph, SECIS instrument, and a special opto-mechanical interface between the coronagraph and SECIS cameras.

1. Water vapor is an important molecule in interstellar and circumstellar clouds, and its 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition at 22 GHz has been used to trace high-excitation gas around star-forming regions and evolved stars. The size of the emitting regions at this frequency is typically a few milliarcseconds, which is too small to provide information on the role of water vapor at large spatial scales. Other water vapor lines have been detected from ground-based or airborne telescopes, but no maps were obtained.

2. The 325 GHz line of water vapor was observed in the direction of Orion IRC2 and other molecular clouds, but no maps were obtained. The present study reports the detection of extended water emission at 325 GHz and shows that the water vapor abundance is around 10^4 in the plateau. Ground-based observations of water vapor provide much finer spatial resolution than ISO or SWAS and an estimate of x(H2O) as accurate as that obtained from extremely optically thick H2O lines observed in the submillimeter and far-infrared domains.

3. The observations were performed with the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory at the summit of Mauna Kea on April 1, 1998. The receiver was tuned at the frequency of the 5@xmath04@xmath1 line of H2O (325.152919 GHz), and the H2O line was placed in the upper sideband to minimize atmospheric noise from the image sideband. The pointing was determined by observing the same line towards the O-rich evolved star Vy CMA and was found to be accurate to 5 arcseconds.

1. The paper introduces a new class of networks called sequence nets, which are generated from a sequence of letters and fixed rules of connectivity.
2. Two-letter sequence nets include threshold nets and two newly discovered classes, which can be analyzed easily and have interesting structural properties.
3. The class of sequence nets can be mapped to a difference-threshold net, where nodes are connected if their weights difference satisfies a certain condition.
4. The paper fully classifies 3-letter sequence nets, reducing the number of possible rules to 30 using symmetry arguments.
5. The diameter of sequence nets grows linearly with the number of letters in the alphabet, and for a 3-letter alphabet, it is already 3 or 4, comparable to many everyday life complex nets.
6. The paper shows that some 3-letter sequence nets can be mapped to generalized forms of threshold nets, but it is unclear if such a mapping is always possible.
7. The paper leaves open questions, such as finding a comprehensive approach to determine which sequences lead to connected nets and whether there is a systematic way to find mappings for any sequence rule.

1. The paper discusses variable selection methods based on penalty theory in high-dimensional data analysis, particularly the Lasso method, which uses the L1-norm penalty. The Lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution, and the L1 penalty can be transformed into the Laplace prior. This prior can be expressed as a Gaussian scale mixture, leading to Bayesian developments of the Lasso and its variants.

2. Nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework has also been explored, including the local linear approximation (LLA) algorithm, which combines the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with an inverse Laplace transform. The LLA algorithm can be used to obtain the nonconvex log and exp penalties, which can be defined via composition of log and exp.

3. The paper proposes a new approach to Bayesian nonconvex penalization using subordinators, which are one-dimensional Lévy processes that are almost surely non-decreasing. The Laplace exponent of a subordinator is a Bernstein function, which can be used to define nonconvex penalty functions. The authors show that the Laplace exponent can be transformed into a nonconvex penalty function.

4. The authors consider two families of compound Poisson subordinators, which are constructed by mixing gamma and Poisson processes. These subordinators can be used to define nonconvex penalty functions, including the log and exp penalties. The limiting cases of these penalties are also discussed.

5. The paper applies the compound Poisson subordinators to Bayesian sparse learning problems, including linear regression. The authors propose a hierarchical model for the joint prior of the regression coefficients, which involves a subordinator as a latent shrinkage parameter. The full conditional distribution of the regression coefficients is proper, and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate can be obtained using an EM algorithm.

6. The authors propose an ECME (Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either) algorithm for learning about the regression coefficients and the local regularization parameters simultaneously. The algorithm is related to the LLA procedure and shares the same convergence property.

7. The paper conducts experiments on simulated data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that the approach outperforms the Lasso and other nonconvex penalties in terms of model prediction accuracy and variable selection ability.

8. The authors compare the performance of different nonconvex penalties, including log, exp, LFR, and CEL. The results show that these penalties are competitive and outperform the Lasso",0

1. The paper discusses the nonlinear current response of superconductors, particularly in the context of two-band superconductors. The authors use a theoretical framework to calculate the nonlinear coefficient, which is a measure of the nonlinear current response. They find that the nonlinear coefficient is affected by the dimensionality of the system, with 2D systems showing a different behavior than 3D systems. The authors also find that strong electron-phonon coupling and impurities can increase the nonlinear coefficient.

2. The authors apply their theoretical framework to the specific case of MgB2, a two-band superconductor. They find that the nonlinear coefficient shows a nonmonotonic feature around the lower band energy scale, but is monotonically increasing with temperature. The authors also find that the second band effects are more pronounced in the nonlinear coefficient than in the superfluid density. The results are in good agreement with experimental data.

3. The authors also discuss the implications of their results for the understanding of two-band superconductors. They find that the nonlinear coefficient can be used as a probe of the order parameter symmetry and can provide information about the underlying physics of the superconductor. The authors also suggest that their results can be used to study other two-band superconductors and to develop new experimental techniques to measure the nonlinear coefficient. The study provides new insights into the behavior of two-band superconductors and has implications for the development of new superconducting materials.",1

1. The classification problem is a crucial task in time series data mining, and 1-nearest neighbor (1-nn) with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is one of the best classifiers for time series data. The selection of an appropriate distance measure is crucial for 1-nn classification, and the selection criteria depend on the nature of the data. DTW distance is more accurate than Euclidean distance for time series data. The Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) was originally used to speed up DTW calculation and later introduced as a DTW global constraint.

2. The S-C band was first implemented for the speech community, and the width of the global constraint was fixed to be 10% of the time series length. However, recent work reveals that the classification accuracy depends solely on this global constraint, and the size of the constraint depends on the properties of the data. To determine a suitable size, all possible widths of the global constraint are tested, and the band with the maximum training accuracy is selected. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) has been introduced to generalize the global constraint model represented by a one-dimensional array.

3. The R-K band allows great flexibility to adjust the global constraint, but a learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi R-K bands. In the original work of R-K band, a hill climbing search algorithm with two heuristic functions (accuracy and distance metrics) is proposed. The search algorithm climbs through a space by trying to increase/decrease specific parts of the bands until terminal conditions are met. However, this learning algorithm still suffers from an overfitting phenomenon since an accuracy metric is used as a heuristic function to guide the search.

4. To solve this problem, two new learning algorithms, i.e., band boundary extraction and iterative learning, are proposed. The band boundary extraction method first obtains a maximum, mean, and mode of the paths positions on the DTW distance matrix. The iterative learning adjusts band structures in each round of the iteration to a silhouette index. Both algorithms are run, and the band that gives better results is selected. In the prediction step, the 1-nn using DTW distance with this discovered band is used to classify unlabeled data.

5. A lower bound, LB_Keogh, is also used to speed up the 1-nn classification. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives some important background for the proposed work, Section 3 introduces",0

1. The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing the electroweak scale, and the discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) strengthens the correctness of the SM. However, an anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) has been reported, which could be a hint of new physics beyond the SM.

2. The authors of the paper consider the possibility of a new gauge interaction beyond the SM, which could explain the muon g-2 anomaly, and explore the implications of this new interaction on the lepton sector. They find that the new interaction could lead to a breaking of the lepton symmetry, which could have implications for the baryon asymmetry of the universe.

3. The authors calculate the constraints on the parameters of the new interaction to avoid the washout of the baryon asymmetry, and find that the condition is satisfied if the Yukawa coupling of the new interaction is small or if the Majorana masses of the right-handed neutrinos are small. They also discuss the implications of the new interaction for the decay of the right-handed neutrinos and the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.",1

1. Entanglement is a unique property in the quantum world that plays an important role in quantum information processing, but it is affected by decoherence, which leads to the loss of entanglement. The study of entanglement dynamics under decoherence has attracted much attention in recent years.

2. The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed, where the entanglement of qubits can be terminated in a finite time despite the coherence of single qubits losing in an asymptotical manner. However, further studies have shown that ESD is not always the eventual fate of qubit entanglement.

3. The entanglement can revive again after some time of ESD, which has been observed in optical systems, and this revived entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols. In some occasions, ESD does not happen at all, and finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long-time limit.

4. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD of qubits is always accompanied with the entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of reservoirs. A similar situation happens for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom for one of the two particles interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.

5. The entanglement does not go away, but it changes its location, and this is reminiscent of the work of Yonac et al., in which the entanglement dynamics has been studied in a double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model. The entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system, but an identity has been satisfied at any time.

6. The paper shows that this identity is still valid for a system consisting of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs, even in the presence of decoherence. The distribution of entanglement among the bipartite subsystems is dependent on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.

7. The rich dynamical behaviors obtained previously in the literature can be regarded as special cases of the present result or Markovian approximation. The entanglement can be stably distributed among all the bipartite subsystems if the qubit and its reservoir can form a bound state and the non-Markovian effect is important.

1. The origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still an unexplained astrophysical phenomenon, and one of the possible explanations is the collapse of a massive star or the coalescence of a compact binary system, which would also emit gravitational waves (GWs). The detection of GWs associated with GRBs could provide insight into these events.

2. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, which have been used to search for correlations between GRB events detected by BeppoSAX and GW signals. The detectors have different resonant frequencies and bandwidths, with Explorer having a larger bandwidth due to an improved readout system.

3. The analysis uses a cross-correlation method to search for correlations between the outputs of the two GW detectors, which allows for unknown time differences between GRB and GW bursts. The method also accounts for unmodeled noise and provides a way to infer the amplitude of GW signals.

4. The results of the analysis are presented in terms of the probability density function of the GW amplitude, which shows that the highest beliefs are for very small values, while values above a certain threshold are practically ruled out. An upper limit is also provided, which excludes the presence of signals of amplitude above a certain value with 95% probability.

5. The results are also presented in terms of a scaled likelihood function, which provides a way to combine results from independent datasets and can be used to update beliefs about the GW amplitude. The function is interpreted as a ""relative belief updating ratio"" or a ""probability density function shape distortion function"".

6. The method can be applied to any expected delay between GRB and GW, and the results can be compared to previous studies, such as the Auriga/BATSE result, which estimated an upper limit under the assumption that GWs arrive at the GRB time within a certain time window.",0

1. The paper discusses the complexity of scientific publications and the importance of citation analysis. With the vast amount of publications being produced, it can be overwhelming to select high-quality work. Citation mechanism is often used to discover relevant publications, and the number of citations is believed to be an estimate of scientific credibility. However, this should not be taken too literally, as some publications may have gone unnoticed or forgotten over time.

2. The paper reviews previous studies on citation distribution, which have shown that it follows a power-law form. This is due to highly cited papers being more likely to acquire further citations, a process known as preferential attachment. The distribution of scientific publications is well-studied, and network models have been developed to mimic its complex structure. However, these models focus on the total number of citations without considering the issuing publications.

3. The paper proposes a new model that considers two research areas and referencing within and across each other. The model is defined and analyzed using a rate equation approach, and the results are compared with existing data. The model is applicable to other complex systems, such as the web of human sexual contacts, where interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks. The paper is organized into sections, with the model definition and analysis in the first section and discussions and comparisons in the final section.

4. The model is built by introducing new nodes with no incoming links to two networks, with each node having outgoing links that attach to pre-existing nodes in both networks. The attachments are preferential, and the rate of acquiring a link depends on the number of connections and initial attractiveness of the pre-existing nodes. The model is analyzed using rate equations, and the time evolution of the network is described. The results show that the total in-degree distribution follows a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and initial attractiveness.

5. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of the model and its applications to different complex systems. The model can represent a variety of systems, including citation networks and the web of human sexual contacts. The results are compared with empirical studies, and the model is shown to be flexible and able to reproduce observed distributions.

1. The paper discusses the theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in high-energy collisions, which is traditionally framed as a two-step process involving hard scattering and fragmentation. However, this approach is inadequate for producing particles at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions. Instead, recombination of partons is a more suitable hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved. The goal of the paper is to introduce the concept of shower partons and determine their distributions.

2. The fragmentation process can be represented by a generic formula involving the joint distribution of quarks and antiquarks, and a recombination function for meson formation. The shower parton distributions can be determined from this formula, and the recombination function is known from previous studies. The paper focuses on the fragmentation problem and regards the formula as the basis of the recombination model for fragmentation. The left-hand side of the formula is the fragmentation function, known from parameterization that fits the data.

3. The paper selects five fragmentation functions corresponding to various fragmentation processes and determines five shower parton distributions from them. In the non-strange sector, there are three shower parton distributions to be determined from three phenomenological fragmentation functions. The strange sector involves two additional fragmentation functions and two additional shower parton distributions. The recombination functions for kaon and pion are specified, and the integral equations relating the fragmentation functions to the shower parton distributions are solved.

4. The paper compares its approach to those of Marchesini-Webber and Geiger, which incorporate QCD dynamics in their description of branching and collision processes. However, these approaches are complex and do not provide easily adaptable results. The paper's approach makes no attempt to treat QCD dynamics but guarantees that the shower parton distributions reproduce the fragmentation functions. The shower partons obtained are ready to hadronize and are related to the constituents of final hadrons.

5. The paper applies the shower parton distributions to two problems: hadron production in a thermal environment and dihadron distribution in a jet. In the first problem, a hard parton is produced in a background of thermal partons, and the shower parton distributions are used to calculate the production of pions from the recombination of thermal and shower partons. The result shows that the thermal-shower recombination is more important than fragmentation in the range of transverse momentum shown.

1. The paper discusses a nonconvex semidefinite programming problem with a nonempty, closed convex set and nonconvex matrix-valued mappings. The problem has applications in static output feedback controller design and topology optimization. The authors propose a new method to solve this problem.

2. The method involves approximating the nonconvex feasible set by a sequence of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation sets. This approach is a generalization of previous methods and can be applied to solve many problems in static output feedback control. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not require a globalization strategy.

3. The authors define a psd-convex overestimate of a matrix-valued mapping and provide two examples of such overestimates. The first example is a bilinear form, and the second example is a psd-nonconvex matrix-valued mapping. The psd-convex overestimate is not unique, and the choice of overestimate can affect the performance of the algorithm.

4. The algorithm involves solving a sequence of convex semidefinite programming subproblems, each of which is formed by using an inner psd-convex approximation of the nonconvex constraint. The subproblems are solved using standard semidefinite programming software tools. The algorithm terminates when a stationary point is reached.

5. The authors prove some properties of the feasible set of the problem, including the fact that the sequence generated by the algorithm is feasible and strictly descent. They also show that the algorithm converges to a kkt point under certain assumptions. The assumptions include the existence of a kkt point and the solvability of the convex subproblems.

The paper investigates collaborative relay beamforming in cognitive radio networks under secrecy constraints, where the goal is to maximize the secrecy rate while keeping the interference on primary users below a certain limit. The problem is formulated as a semidefinite programming problem, and an optimization framework is provided. Two suboptimal null space beamforming schemes are proposed to simplify the computation. The schemes are shown to achieve near-optimal performance with much less computational burden.

2. The paper also provides numerical results to illustrate the performances of different beamforming schemes. The results show that the suboptimal null space beamforming schemes are good alternatives to the optimal scheme, especially in the high SNR regime. The results also suggest that imposing individual relay power constraints leads to small losses in the secrecy rates.

1. The paper discusses the quantization of the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFS) while maintaining the @xmath0-invariance, which is broken in the usual Lorenz gauge. The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism to realize all CFS as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. The introduction of auxiliary fields and the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with gauge freedom. The use of a well-suited coordinate system allows the @xmath0-invariant CFS formulas to take a Minkowskian form.

2. The authors explain how to obtain the @xmath0-invariant Maxwell field in CFS from a six-dimensional one-form, and they derive the dynamical equations, which are the Maxwell equation and a conformal gauge condition on any CFS. The constraint on the auxiliary field is applied on the quantum space to select an invariant subspace of physical states, and the Wightman functions thus include the whole big space. The Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme is applied, and the quantum fields are defined, allowing the construction of the Fock spaces. The annihilation and creation operators obey a certain algebra.

3. The Wightman two-point functions on CFS are obtained from their Minkowskian counterparts, and the authors show how to get the Wightman functions related to the fields on de Sitter space. The two-point function has the same physical content as the Allen and Jacobson two-point function. The paper concludes that maintaining the @xmath0 symmetry during the whole quantization process is worth it, as it makes the calculations much easier. The problem then goes back to Minkowski, and the classical and quantum structures of the free Maxwell field are locally the same in all CFS.",1

The game has been shown to have deep connections to number theory, algebra, and combinatorics, and can simulate complex systems like the deterministic fixed-energy sandpile.

The period and transient length of games on certain graphs, such as the complete graph and complete bipartite graph, have been studied and bounded.

The burst has a high-energy emission, consistent with other observed short GRBs.

2. The fireshell model is used to describe the GRB phenomenon, which involves a sequence of physical and astrophysical events, including the formation of a pair plasma, its expansion and acceleration, and the emission of a proper gamma-ray burst (P-GRB) and a prompt emission.

The article reviews the recent progress on the NS equilibrium configuration, including the effects of rotation and the nuclear equation of state on the critical mass, and the existence of electromagnetic fields close to the critical value. The global charge neutrality condition is imposed, leading to a critical mass for a non-rotating NS.

The hypercritical accretion process onto a NS is discussed, including the energy released during the process, which depends on the gain of gravitational potential energy and the change of binding energy of the NS. The accretion luminosity can be as high as 10^52 erg/s for accretion rates of 10^-3 M_sun/s.

2. The simplest example of this approach is the prediction of the W-boson mass, which is strongly correlated with the top quark mass in the SM. However, in models with additional scalar fields, this correlation is weakened or even logarithmic.

3. The authors consider two specific models: the SM augmented by a real scalar triplet (triplet model) and the minimal left-right symmetric model. In both models, the dependence of the W-boson mass on the top quark mass is logarithmic, unlike in the SM where it is quadratic.

4. The triplet model has four physical scalar fields, and the authors show that the W-boson mass depends quadratically on the scalar masses. This has important implications for Higgs searches, as a heavy neutral Higgs boson can be consistent with experimental data.

The approach is based on a rational representation of the self-energy, which is constrained by several limits and conditions, such as the Hartree-Fock value, zero-frequency value, and quasiparticle mass renormalization.

The authors discuss two approximate methods for solving the impurity model, namely the slave-boson mean-field (SBMF) method and the Hubbard I approximation, which are used to obtain the necessary parameters for the interpolative scheme. The SBMF method is found to provide a good description of the low-frequency part of the Green's function and the quasiparticle residue, although it tends to overestimate the mass renormalization.

The paper presents comparisons of the interpolative method with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, showing that the method can capture the functional dependence of the quasiparticle residue and the density-density correlation function on filling, interaction, and degeneracy.

1. The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions is a topic of growing interest due to its application to complex systems, and the ZGB model is a well-known model that describes the oxidation of CO over a catalytic surface. The model has been modified to incorporate a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface, which affects the phase transitions.

2. The site and pair approximations were used to study the effects of inert sites on the phase transitions, and the results show that the width of the reactive window decreases with increasing values of the concentration of inert sites. The transition between the reactive and co-poisoned phase is always of first-order in the site and pair approximations.

3. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to check the results obtained in the site and pair approximations, and the phase diagram of the model was obtained. The simulations show that the transition between the active and co-poisoned phases is continuous for all values of the concentration of inert sites.

4. The production rate of CO2 molecules attains its maximum value exactly at the first-order transition, and the maximum production rate of CO2 molecules moves towards the reactive window when the concentration of inert sites is greater than the critical value. The overall effect of inert sites is to reduce the production of CO2 molecules.

The weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process is a perturbation of the symmetric simple exclusion process, where particles jump with a small asymmetry in the jump rate.

The replacement theorem is given by the form of super exponential estimate and follows from the one-block estimate and the two-blocks estimate.

1. The study of harmonic maps was initiated by F. B. Fuller, J. Nash, and J. H. Sampson, while the first general result on the existence of harmonic maps is due to Eells-Sampson. Harmonic maps are extrema of the energy functional defined on the space of smooth maps between Riemannian (pseudo-Riemannian) manifolds. The trace of the second fundamental form of such maps vanishes. Harmonic maps have applications in computational fluid dynamics, minimal surface theory, string theory, gravity, and quantum field theory.

2. Harmonic maps between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds behave differently and their study must be subject to some restricted classes of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The paper is organized into sections, including the basic definitions about almost para-Hermitian manifolds, almost paracontact manifolds, and normal almost paracontact manifolds. The paper also defines and studies paraholomorphic maps and parapluriharmonic maps. The necessary and sufficient condition for a paraholomorphic map between para-Sasakian manifolds to be parapluriharmonic is obtained.

3. An almost product structure on a smooth manifold is a tensor field of type (1,1) satisfying certain conditions. An almost para-complex manifold is an almost product manifold such that the eigenbundles associated with the eigenvalues of the tensor field have the same rank. An almost para-Hermitian manifold is a smooth manifold endowed with an almost para-complex structure and a pseudo-Riemannian metric compatible with the almost para-complex structure.

1. The star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies is a crucial measure for understanding the hierarchical build-up of the universe, and it is regulated by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies. SMBHs grow through accretion of cold material, which heats up and radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum.

2. The radiation from SMBHs can deposit energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy, heating or removing gas and affecting star formation. This process is known as ""feedback"" and is essential for understanding galaxy evolution.

3. The dusty torus surrounding the SMBH absorbs and re-emits radiation, making it difficult to distinguish between star-forming and AGN-heated dust. The far-infrared (FIR) regime is ideal for studying star formation in AGN host galaxies.

4. The Herschel Space Observatory has provided a window into the FIR properties of galaxies, and the SPIRE instrument has pushed into the submillimeter range, allowing for the measurement of dust properties and SFR. The sample of 313 AGN selected from the Swift/BAT catalog has been imaged with Herschel.

5. The correlations between the SPIRE wavebands are strong, indicating that they are produced by closely related temperature components. The weak correlation between 70 and 500 μm emission suggests that different processes contribute to the emission at these wavelengths.

6. The ultra-hard X-ray luminosity of the AGN is a direct measure of its power, and correlations between the SPIRE and X-ray luminosities can reveal whether the AGN contributes to the FIR emission. No significant correlation is found for the entire sample, but a weak correlation is seen for Sy 1s.

7. The difference in correlations between Sy 1s and Sy 2s may be due to the different luminosity distributions or the presence of Compton-thick sources in the Sy 2 sample. However, the reason for the difference remains inconclusive.

8. The SPIRE colors of the AGN host galaxies are similar to those of normal star-forming galaxies, indicating that the FIR emission is not strongly contaminated by AGN-related emission. The colors are consistent with a modified blackbody with temperatures between 15-30 K.

9. A distinct bump in the color distribution is seen for Sy 1s, which cannot be explained by a modified blackbody and may be due to synchrotron radiation. A horizontal spread in the color-color",0

1. The fundamental group of the complement of a plane curve is a topological invariant that can be computed for line arrangements, and it has various applications, including distinguishing between connected components of the moduli space of smooth projective surfaces. The Zariski-Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem states that the fundamental group of the complement of a hypersurface can be computed from the fundamental group of the complement of a plane curve. The fundamental group of the complement of a line arrangement can be used to study Zariski pairs, which are pairs of plane curves with the same combinatorics but non-homeomorphic complements.

2. A line arrangement is called ""real"" if its defining equations can be written with real coefficients, and ""complex"" otherwise. Fan defined a graph associated to the multiple points of a line arrangement, and proved that if the graph is acyclic, then the fundamental group of the complement has a conjugation-free geometric presentation. The importance of this family of arrangements lies in the fact that the incidence lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement, and the fundamental group can be read directly from the arrangement or its incidence lattice.

3. The paper focuses on the problem of which line arrangements have a fundamental group with a conjugation-free geometric presentation, and proves that the fundamental group of a real affine arrangement whose graph is a unique cycle of length 3 and has no line with more than two multiple points, has a conjugation-free geometric presentation. The result is then generalized to arrangements whose graphs are cycles of any length and unions of disjoint cycles, and the group structure of the fundamental group is studied in some cases.",0

1. The paper discusses the generation of flavor symmetry to describe mass and mixing patterns of fermions, particularly in the leptonic sector. The authors focus on the discrete symmetry A4, which has been successful in describing the tribimaximal mixing pattern. However, this symmetry predicts a zero value for the CP violating phase δ, which is inconsistent with experimental results. To address this, the authors introduce a small perturbation to the A4 symmetry.

2. The authors consider a model with an A4 symmetry, which is broken spontaneously and explicitly through a single parameter in the Dirac neutrino mass matrix. They study the effects of this breaking on the mixing angles and CP violating phase δ. The model predicts a non-zero value for δ, which is consistent with experimental results. The authors also explore the implications of this model on leptogenesis.

1. The article discusses the use of constrained density functional theory (CDFT) to study the energy level alignment of a benzene molecule adsorbed on a graphene sheet. CDFT is a method that can accurately calculate the charge transfer energies between a molecule and a substrate. The authors use CDFT to investigate the effect of the molecule-substrate distance on the energy level alignment. The results are compared with experimental data and other theoretical calculations.

2. The authors find that the charge transfer energies depend on the distance between the molecule and the graphene sheet, which is due to the formation of an image charge. This effect cannot be described by standard Kohn-Sham DFT, but is well captured by CDFT. The CDFT results agree well with experimental data for an infinite separation, where the charge transfer energies coincide with the ionization potential and the electron affinity. The authors also compare their results with other theoretical calculations.

3. The authors investigate the effect of a stone-wales defect in the graphene sheet on the energy level alignment. They find that the defect does not affect the energy level alignment, as its electronic density of states has little amplitude at the graphene Fermi level. This is because the defect does not alter the dielectric constant of graphene, which is responsible for the image charge formation. The authors also study the effect of multiple benzene molecules on the energy level alignment.

4. The authors find that the presence of other benzene molecules changes the charge transfer energies, which can be rationalized by a simple classical electrostatic model. The model describes the interaction between a point-like charge and a uniform planar charge distribution, taking into account the finite dielectric constant of graphene. The authors compare their results with a perfect metal, where the dielectric constant is infinite. The CDFT results agree well with the classical model.

2. Many-body effects can cause a strengthening or weakening of the total force acting on a particle surrounded by more than one other particle, or even a change of sign of that force.
3. The authors study the critical Casimir forces (CCFs) between two colloidal particles immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture and close to a homogeneous, planar substrate.
4. The CCFs are calculated using the full three-dimensional numerical analysis of the appropriate mean-field theory (MFT) as given by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian.
5. The normal and lateral CCFs acting on two colloidal particles are studied, and the results show that the forces become overall weaker upon increasing the sphere-surface-to-substrate distance.

7. There is a lateral position corresponding to a stable equilibrium point, and the equilibrium position varies as a function of temperature for fixed sphere size.
8. The preferred arrangement of the colloids is determined by analyzing the direction of the total CCF acting on colloid (2), and the results show that colloids tend to aggregate laterally or on top of each other depending on the boundary conditions.

1. The Multiple Optimised Parameter Estimation and Data Compression (MOPED) algorithm is a patented method for compressing data and speeding up likelihood function evaluations in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model parameters and must be calculated and inverted at each likelihood evaluation. However, MOPED has limitations, including only guaranteeing the maintenance of the Fisher matrix of the likelihood at a chosen point. This can lead to problems with multimodal and degenerate distributions.

2. Despite these limitations, MOPED can provide orders of magnitude improvement in runtime when it accurately represents the likelihood function. The algorithm has been demonstrated to work well in analyzing the spectra of galaxies and estimating the CMB power spectrum. However, it has been found to struggle with ""badly behaved"" likelihoods, such as in light transit analysis. A solution to this problem has been presented, which still allows MOPED to provide a large speed increase.

3. The MOPED method involves defining the data as a vector and the model as a signal plus random noise. The noise is assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and a noise covariance matrix that may depend on the parameters. The full likelihood function is given by a complex equation involving the data, model, and noise covariance matrix. MOPED allows for the elimination of the need for matrix inversion by compressing the data into a smaller set of values.

4. The compression is done by generating a set of weighting vectors, which are used to create a set of MOPED components from the theoretical model and data. The weighting vectors must be computed at some assumed fiducial set of parameter values, which may not necessarily coincide with the true parameters. The process can be iterated, taking the maximum likelihood point found as the new fiducial, to converge on the true parameters.

5. The MOPED algorithm has the additional benefit of allowing for the storage of computed compressed parameters, which require less memory than storing the entire theoretical data set. The weighting vectors only need to be computed once, provided the fiducial model parameters are kept constant over the analysis of different data sets. This can lead to significant computational savings.

6. The limitations of MOPED are demonstrated through several test cases, including a one-dimensional case where the central frequency of a sine-Gaussian burst signal is the only unknown parameter. In this case, MOPED creates a second peak of equal height at an incorrect frequency, which is a serious problem for parameter estimation. This is",0

1. The paper discusses the use of two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy to study atomic properties in excited states, particularly in alkaline atoms. This method allows for precise measurements of energy separations and can be used to lock the frequency of a laser to an excited transition. The technique is useful for studying atomic properties in higher excited states, which is challenging due to experimental complications.

2. The method involves using two lasers, a pump and a probe, that counter-propagate through a thermal vapor, with one of the lasers being modulated. The pump laser connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state, while the probe laser scans over the desired energy manifold. The absorption of the pump laser is monitored as a function of the probe laser detuning.

3. The technique overcomes the limitations of direct absorption spectroscopy, which suffers from low signal-to-noise ratios and the unavailability of detectors at the desired wavelength. The modulation transfer spectroscopy method produces sub-Doppler peaks, also known as Lamb-Bennett dips, with sidebands that correspond to atomic resonances. The sidebands can be used as an in situ ruler for measuring energy separations.

4. The paper presents two ladder systems to illustrate the main features of the technique and its applications. The first system has an amplitude-modulated probe laser, while the second system has a frequency-modulated pump laser. The frequency modulation of the pump laser allows for a good signal-to-noise ratio and enables the locking of the probe laser to an excited atomic resonance.

5. The theoretical model used to describe the system is a three-level atom in a ladder configuration, interacting with two lasers, one of which has sidebands. The model is simplified by ignoring Zeeman sublevels and Doppler broadening, and the density matrix formalism is used to describe the system. The model reproduces the resonance features of the absorption observed in the experiment.

The lasers overlap inside a rubidium glass cell, and the absorption of the pump laser is monitored using a fast photodetector. The power of the pump and probe lasers is adjusted to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.

2. The authors consider a 2D p-wave pairing state with a convective ratio, which measures the relative strength between convection and diffusion, and find that the pair polarization is tilted away from the direction of the force field, leading to a nonzero Hall conductivity. This is a new feature that is absent in s-wave superconductors.

3. The authors calculate the length-dependent response functions, which describe the pair motion, and find that they have a dip-recouping shape, indicating that pairs with a specific size contribute to the Hall effect. The sign of the Hall conductivity depends on whether there are more pairs with smaller or larger sizes.

4. The authors investigate the frequency and temperature dependence of the Hall conductivity and find that it shows a peak structure and sign reversal above the transition temperature, which is a characteristic feature of the KT transition. The peak broadens and moves to higher temperature when frequency increases.

5. The authors also discuss the power dissipation, which is related to the imaginary part of the conductivity, and find that it increases with frequency at low temperature and is suppressed at small frequency when the temperature is above the transition temperature. The peak structure in the power dissipation is broadened and shifted to higher temperature when frequency increases.

The uncertainties on the rotation curve are few km/s, and the error on the rotation curve slope is 0.02.

He employed a variational approach and concluded that H3+ is not stable. His results were later questioned by other researchers.

Later, the issue was reconsidered from the theoretical side by Shoucri and Darling, and Hernndes and Carb.

About twenty years later, Ackermann et al. revisited the question about the existence of H3+ using the finite element method, which provided much higher accuracy than previously achieved. They excluded the possibility of stable H3+ in the electronic ground state. However, the explicit electronic energy data are reported only for one particular equilateral triangular configuration.

The authors of the present study aimed to investigate the stability of H3+ in the equilateral triangular configuration, motivated by the possibility of its existence as a metastable state in a magnetic field. They studied a Coulomb system of one electron and three protons forming an equilateral triangle of size R. The protons are assumed to be infinitely massive according to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation at zero order.

1. The paper discusses the importance of transverse spin fluctuations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, particularly in the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model. These fluctuations play a crucial role in determining macroscopic properties such as long-range order, order parameter, and spin correlations. The authors focus on the strong-coupling limit, where spin fluctuations are strongest, and the zero-temperature AF order parameter is significantly reduced. The Nel temperature is also reduced in three dimensions.

2. The authors review previous studies on spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet. They mention that spin fluctuations are enhanced by strong disorder in the Hubbard model with random on-site energies, leading to the formation of essentially empty and doubly-occupied sites that act like spin vacancies. The problem of spin vacancies is relevant to electron-doped materials, where spin-dilution behavior is observed. However, previous methods for addressing this problem are limited to the low-concentration limit.

3. The authors introduce a new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state. This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model. The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral in order to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators.

4. The authors apply their method to the half-filled Hubbard model in two and three dimensions on square and simple-cubic lattices, respectively. They use the two-sublattice representation due to translational symmetry and work with the χ matrix in momentum space. The authors obtain equal-time, same-site transverse spin correlations from the spin propagator and compare their results with earlier studies.

1. The existence of dark matter (DM) has been established, and its thermal relic abundance has been determined by the WMAP experiment. The WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) is a promising candidate for DM, and it can be accommodated economically by introducing an inert scalar field. The imposed parity ensures the stability of the DM candidate.

2. Neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses as compared to the electroweak scale, and their flavor structure may indicate that they are of Majorana type. The seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model are two ways to explain tiny neutrino masses, but they do not contain a DM candidate. In some models, the DM candidate can be naturally contained.

3. In the Higgs Triplet Model (HTM), a triplet scalar field is introduced to generate Majorana masses for neutrinos. The triplet field has a new Yukawa interaction term with leptons, and its vacuum expectation value breaks lepton number conservation by two units. The HTM does not contain a DM candidate, and the smallness of the triplet vacuum expectation value is not naturally explained.

4. To explain the smallness of the triplet vacuum expectation value, a small parameter is introduced, which is an attractive option because it allows the triplet scalars to be produced at the LHC. However, there is no reason why this parameter is tiny in the HTM. In the presented model, the parameter is naturally small because it arises at the one-loop level.

5. The model extends the HTM by introducing a new scalar field that breaks lepton number conservation spontaneously. The conservation is assumed to be broken by the vacuum expectation value of a new scalar field, which is a complex singlet under the SM gauge symmetry. The model also introduces an unbroken Z2 symmetry to obtain DM candidates.

6. The DM candidate is a mixture of two CP-even neutral scalars, and its mass is determined by the Z2 symmetry. The model predicts a suppression factor for the DM relic abundance, which is constrained by the WMAP experiment. The suppression factor can be estimated, and it is possible to obtain a value consistent with the WMAP experiment.

7. The model has a characteristic feature that the triplet scalar mass is much larger than the DM mass. This feature can be probed in collider experiments, and a possible collider signature would be a final state with jets and two charged leptons whose invariant mass gives the DM mass. The model would be supported if experiments observe such final states.

2. A new telecommunications infrastructure is required to accommodate the quantum properties of quantum communications, including quantum memories, quantum repeaters, and quantum channels.
3. The components of this infrastructure must operate in a strictly quantum way, and imperfections in these devices can be tolerated to some extent.
4. A minimal quantum requirement for devices is that they do not act as ""measure and prepare"" channels, which destroy quantum correlations in bipartite states.
5. The quantum throughput of a device can be quantified by sending part of an entangled state through the channel and determining the amount of entanglement that remains.
6. The method proposed in the text uses a ""prepare and measure"" scenario, where Alice's measurements are absorbed into the initial state preparation, to quantify the effective entanglement in optical systems.
7. The scheme involves estimating the parameters of the projected state using homodyne detection and then minimizing the entanglement over all compatible forms of the projected state.
8. The method is demonstrated using data corresponding to the action of an optical channel on field quadratures, and the results show that the tolerable excess noise is around 5% of the vacuum for a transmittivity of 0.9.

1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided significant insights into subatomic physics over the past 83 years. The discovery of the large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron laid the groundwork for the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED. The Dirac equation shows that for spin one-half point-like particles, the gyromagnetic ratio is 2, and the anomaly arises from radiative corrections. The situation for baryons is different, with their internal quark structure giving them large anomalies.

2. The measurement of the muon anomaly is sensitive to higher mass scale radiative corrections, making it a valuable tool for searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The Standard Model value of the muon anomaly has measurable contributions from three types of radiative processes: QED loops, hadronic loops, and weak loops. A significant difference between the experimental value and the Standard Model prediction would signify the presence of new physics. The muon anomaly is currently measured to 0.5 parts per million (ppm).

3. The experimental method used to measure the muon anomaly involves storing muons in a magnetic field and measuring the spin precession frequency. The spin precession frequency is proportional to the anomaly, and the experiment requires precision measurements of the muon spin precession frequency and the magnetic field. The goal of the new experiment is to reach a precision of 0.1 ppm, with the goal of controlling the total systematic errors on the magnetic field and on the muon frequency measurement to 0.1 ppm each.

4. The search for electric dipole moments (EDMs) is also an important area of research, as they would signify physics beyond the Standard Model. The predicted EDMs for leptons are unmeasurably small, but SUSY models and other dynamics at the TeV scale do predict EDMs at measurable levels. A new experiment to search for a permanent EDM of the muon with a design sensitivity of 10^(-24) e-cm is being planned. The search for EDMs will continue, and if one is observed, the motivation for further searches in other systems will be even stronger.",0

1. The paper discusses a new design for an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling. The origin of the reactive coupling lies in the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator.

2. The authors examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields and report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting, which is different from previous works that only considered dispersive coupling. The paper is organized into sections that introduce the physical system, calculate the expectation values of the system operators, and discuss normal mode splitting in output fields.

3. The system consists of a microdisk cavity coupled to a freestanding waveguide, with a strong pump field and a weak Stokes field entering the system through the waveguide. The waveguide moves along the direction of the optical force exerted by the photons from the cavity, causing a change in the resonant frequency of the cavity field and the cavity decay rate.

4. The Hamiltonian of the system is given, which includes the energy of the cavity field, the energy of the waveguide, and the interactions between the waveguide and the incident fields. The authors use the mean field assumption and expand the cavity decay rate to the first order of the waveguide displacement.

5. The time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are expressed, and the steady-state solution is simplified to first order in the Stokes field. The expectation values are found to oscillate at three frequencies: the pump frequency, the Stokes frequency, and twice the pump frequency.

6. The authors calculate the expectation value of the output fields using the input-output relation and examine the roots of the denominator of the output field response. They find that the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity can result in normal mode splitting of the output fields.

7. The variation of the real and imaginary parts of the roots of the denominator with increasing pump power is shown for zero reactive coupling and nonzero reactive coupling. The results indicate that the reactive coupling can lead to normal mode splitting, and the peak separation increases with increasing pump power.

8. The output power at the Stokes frequency and the anti-Stokes frequency is calculated, and the plots of the output power versus the normalized detuning between the Stokes field and the pump field are presented. The results show that the reactive coupling can cause four-wave mixing, generating an anti-Stokes component.

1. The behavior of QCD at finite baryon density is crucial for understanding the structure of compact stars and the conditions near the core of collapsing stars, and it is known that sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is in the color superconducting phase.
2. The color superconducting phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the charge neutrality condition and equilibrium requirements induce a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which can lead to chromomagnetic instability.
3. The instability of the color superconducting phase can be understood in a general picture, where the phase fluctuation or pseudo Nambu-Goldstone current plays a crucial role, and the system can be stabilized by a spin-1 condensate or a single-plane wave Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF) state.

1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4100 planetary candidates in 3200 systems, revealing that small planets are nearly ubiquitous and that planets between Earth-sized and Neptune-sized are common. The transition from ""rocky"" to ""non-rocky"" planets occurs near a radius of 2.5 Earth radii and is very sharp.

2. The Kepler pipeline assumes that all host stars are single, which can lead to underestimated planetary radii and occurrence rates if the star is actually a multiple star system. The presence of a stellar companion can dilute the observed transit depth, resulting in a smaller planetary radius.

3. The authors have explored the effects of undetected stellar companions on the derived planetary radii and occurrence rates. They found that the mean correction factor for unvetted Kepler stars is 1.5, implying that planetary radii are underestimated by a factor of 1.5 on average.

4. The authors have also explored the effectiveness of observational vetting, such as radial velocity and high-resolution imaging, in reducing the uncertainties in planetary radii. They found that vetting can reduce the mean correction factor to 1.2, implying that planetary radii are underestimated by a factor of 1.2 on average.

5. The authors have applied their analysis to K2 and TESS, which will observe brighter and closer stars than Kepler. They found that the mean correction factor for vetted K2/TESS stars is only 1.04, implying that planetary radii are underestimated by a factor of 1.04 on average.

1. The range of HI column densities in nearby galaxies is similar to those in damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems, making it an attractive experiment to map HI gas in DLA systems and measure their total gas mass, extent, and dynamics. However, this is currently impossible with present technology due to the weak 21-cm line emission. The detection efficiency of DLAs is not distance-dependent, but the redshift number density of DLAs decreases rapidly towards lower redshifts.

2. There is a wealth of information on cold gas properties in local galaxies, but little possibility to bridge this with DLA absorption profiles at intermediate and high redshift. Most observers resort to optical wavelengths to study DLAs, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been notably unsuccessful. A few positive identifications exist, mostly from HST imaging.

3. The success rate for finding low-redshift DLA host galaxies is better due to their expected brightness and larger separation from the QSO on the sky. Early surveys for low-redshift DLA host galaxies consisted of broad-band imaging and lacked spectroscopic follow-up. Later studies aimed at measuring redshifts to determine the association of optically identified galaxies with DLAs.

4. There are now around 10 DLA galaxies known at z<1, spanning a wide range of galaxy properties from inconspicuous LSB dwarfs to giant spirals and early-type galaxies. It is not just luminous, high surface brightness spiral galaxies that contribute to the HI cross-section above the DLA threshold. A statistical study can be done to see if the properties of DLAs and DLA galaxies agree with our knowledge of HI in the local universe.

5. Blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe have resulted in an accurate measurement of the HI mass function, which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift DLA studies. The HI mass function is measured with surveys such as HIPASS. However, these surveys are not very useful in constraining the column density distribution function of HI due to the large beam widths of the single-dish instruments.

The WHISP sample of 355 galaxies observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope provides high-resolution 21-cm maps, allowing for the calculation of the column density distribution function.

1. The majority of stars are formed in star clusters, and only a small percentage of gas is turned into stars during the collapse and fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud. The resulting cluster is made up of a combination of gas and stars, but the gas is removed on timescales shorter than a crossing time due to stellar winds and supernovae explosions. This leaves the cluster out of equilibrium, with a significant fraction of its mass lost.

2. The effects of rapid gas expulsion on young star clusters have been studied theoretically, but its effects have received little consideration in observational studies. Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying their internal dynamics, but this assumes that the cluster is in virial equilibrium. However, Bastian et al. (2006) noted an age-dependence in how well clusters fit standard IMFs, suggesting that young clusters may not be in equilibrium.

3. The present work looks at the detailed luminosity profiles of three young massive clusters, M82-F, NGC 1569-A, and NGC 1705-1, which reside in nearby starburst galaxies. The clusters have been reported to have non-standard stellar IMFs, but the authors suggest that they are likely not in dynamical equilibrium due to rapid gas loss. The ages of the clusters are assumed to be 3, 4, and 1020 Myr, respectively.

4. The observations were taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the surface brightness profiles of the clusters were produced on a per-pixel basis. The profiles show an excess of light at large radii compared to King or EFF profiles, which is a signature of violent relaxation after gas expulsion. The authors also note that the background subtraction is non-trivial due to the large distance of the galaxies and non-uniform background around the clusters.

5. The authors model star clusters using N-body simulations, which show that the expulsion of residual gas from star clusters can produce the observed excess light at large radii. The simulations also show that the escaping stars are not lost instantaneously, but rather produce a ""tail"" in the surface brightness profile. The normalisation of the surface brightness is arbitrary and scaled to match the observed clusters.

6. The simulations confirm that clusters with effective star formation efficiencies between 40-50% best reproduce the observations. The authors also note that similar surface brightness profiles are seen in young LMC clusters, which are well matched by their simulations. The study suggests that the excess light at large",0

1. The paper investigates the influence of polychromatic perturbation on wave packet dynamics in a one-dimensional double-well potential. The authors numerically calculate the transition probability, time-fluctuation, uncertainty product, and phase space portrait. The results are compared with those of monochromatic perturbation and stochastic perturbation.

2. The authors classify the motions in the parameter space into coherent motions and irregular motions, and find that the critical value of the perturbation strength depends on the number of frequency components. The coherent motion regime is characterized by a regular tunneling oscillation, while the irregular motion regime is characterized by a decoherent and diffusive behavior.

3. Within the regular motion regime, the period of the tunneling oscillation is reduced with an increase in the number of colors and/or strength of the perturbation. This can be explained by the increase of the instanton tunneling rate due to the appearance of a stochastic layer near the separatrix. The perturbed instanton picture is one of the expressions for chaos-assisted tunneling.

4. In the irregular motion regime, the growth of the uncertainty product initially increases and saturates at a certain level due to quantum interference. In contrast, in the stochastically perturbed case, the uncertainty product grows unboundedly because the external stochasticity breaks the quantum interference in the internal dynamics.

5. The growth of the uncertainty product is strongly related to the growth of the energy of the wave packet. The quantum fluctuation observed in the semiquantal picture is suppressed by interference effects in the fully quantum motion.

6. The authors use a semiquantal approximation to study the partial quantum fluctuation, which enhances the chaotic behavior and simultaneously enhances the tunneling and decoherence of the wave packet. However, the semiquantal picture breaks down for chaos-induced delocalized states.

7. The classical phase space portraits in the polychromatically perturbed double-well system show that increasing the perturbation strength destroys the separatrix and forms a chaotic layer in the vicinity of the separatrix. The width of the chaotic layer grows faster in the polychromatically perturbed cases than in the monochromatically perturbed case.

8. The authors estimate the classical Lyapunov exponent and find a transition from motion of KAM system to chaotic motion as the perturbation strength increases. The increasing of the number of colors reduces the value of the critical perturbation strength of a transition from a motion of KAM system to fully chaotic motion.

1. The paper discusses the development of a unified stochastic formalism for open quantum systems, which can be used to study the dynamics of a system interacting with a complex environment. The formalism is based on the stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), which describes the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system. The SLE is derived from the von Neumann equation by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom and introducing stochastic noises.

2. The stochastic formalism is applicable to various bath models, including bosonic, fermionic, and spin baths. The bath correlation functions are used to define the stochastic noises, which are either complex-valued or Grassmann-valued depending on the bath model. The formalism can be used to study the dynamics of open quantum systems in a wide range of regimes, from weak to strong coupling and from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics.

3. The paper also discusses the development of deterministic numerical methods based on the SLE, which are referred to as the generalized hierarchical equations (GHE). The GHE are derived by formally averaging out the stochastic noises in the SLE, and they provide an efficient way to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems. The GHE can be applied to study the dynamics of systems interacting with bosonic, fermionic, and spin baths.

The GHE are shown to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of open quantum systems, and they have the potential to be applied to a wide range of problems in quantum physics and chemistry.",0

The Casimir-Lifshitz force between two uncharged parallel plates in vacuum arises from quantum fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields, and it can be attractive or repulsive depending on the dielectric properties of the materials. The force has been experimentally verified in several high-precision measurements.

2. The torque between two parallel birefringent plates, predicted by Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash, has not been experimentally demonstrated yet, and its magnitude has not been numerically calculated for specific materials. The torque is expected to be proportional to the area of the interacting surfaces and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

3. The authors propose an experimental setup to measure the torque between a birefringent disk and a plate in liquid ethanol, where the disk would float on top of the plate due to the repulsive retarded van der Waals force. The disk would be free to rotate in a ""frictionless bearing"" and its rotation could be monitored using a microscope objective and a CCD camera.

The sign of the rotation depends on the choice of the interacting materials, and the torque is smaller in ethanol than in vacuum.

The study of random walks on graphs is a central problem in network science, with implications for issues like epidemics and web page classification. Topologically biased random walks (TBRW) are a new framework for studying community detection and synchronization in complex networks.

2. TBRW allows for the exploration of network structure more efficiently by using topological properties to bias the random walks. The paper introduces a set of mathematical tools to investigate the ""bias parameters"" space and applies them to uncover details in the spectra of graph transition matrices. This leads to a novel methodology for efficient community finding.

3. The transition matrix of a graph can be defined with weights that represent the rates of jumps from one vertex to another, and these weights can be biased based on vertex or edge properties. The paper shows that the stationary distribution of the biased random walk is related to the vertex properties used for biasing. The detailed balance condition is also proven to hold for the biased random walk.

4. The paper introduces a symmetric matrix that shares the same eigenvalues with the transition matrix, allowing for the definition of a meaningful distance between vertices. This distance can provide important additional information for community partition of complex networks. The eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix can be used to study the parameter dependence of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

The paper shows that the spectral gap has a well-defined maximum for different strategies and networks, and this maximum is achieved when the average difference between the property used for biasing and its expectation in the neighborhood of a vertex vanishes.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) breaks down at the Planck scale, leading to a minimum measurable length. This concept is supported by various theories, including string theory and black hole physics.

The GUP has been derived in various forms, including one that implies a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum. This principle has been applied to various systems, including a particle in a box.

The energy-time uncertainty principle has been applied to the Planck era of the universe, where it has been used to calculate the Planck time, length, mass, energy, density, and entropy. These calculations have led to new insights into the behavior of the universe at the Planck scale.

4. The Planck time is a fundamental unit of time that is derived from the HUP and the gravitational constant. The Planck time is approximately 10^-43 seconds, and it is a critical point in the history of the universe. During this time, the universe was still in its quantum gravity regime, and classical general relativity did not apply.

These corrections are significant and can affect our understanding of the universe at the Planck scale.

The paper discusses a new method to compute couplings in conformal field theories (CFTs) by deforming the theory with a marginal or irrelevant operator, and relates the couplings to the anomalous dimension matrix of the deformed theory.

The authors apply this method to the case of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) deformed by the Lagrangian operator, and use integrability techniques to compute the couplings of the Lagrangian with single-trace operators.

The embedding scheme is derived using a trial function with continuity in the small component across the surface separating regions i and ii, and is shown to be stable and converge to exact eigenvalues in the case of a confined hydrogen atom. The scheme avoids variational collapse by using a basis set of separate large and small component spinors that satisfy kinetic balance.

3. The paper also derives the Green function for the embedded Hamiltonian and illustrates its use in the continuum regime of a confined hydrogen model, as well as in a more challenging problem of calculating the local density of states on a silver monolayer in a Au(001)/Ag/Au(001) sandwich structure. The results obtained with the embedding scheme are shown to be comparable to those found using relativistic scattering theory.",1

1. The analysis of dynamic processes in complex networks is a major research area with applications in social, biological, and technological systems.
2. The spread of information in online social networks, the evolution of an epidemic outbreak, and the dynamics of cascading failures in the electrical grid are examples of these processes.
3. Most modeling and analysis techniques are tailored to study dynamic processes in static networks, but real-world networks are constantly evolving over time.
4. The effects of temporal structural variations in the dynamics of networked systems remain poorly understood, and there is a lack of tools to analyze and control these systems.
5. The authors study adaptation mechanisms over arbitrary contact networks, deriving an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (ASIS) model.
6. The authors propose an efficient algorithm for optimally tuning the adaptation rates of an arbitrary network to eradicate an epidemic outbreak in the ASIS model.
7. The authors confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bounds with several numerical simulations and compare their optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures.
8. The authors find that both degree-based and eigenvector-based edge-centralities are good measures for determining the amount of investment in tuning cutting rates.
9. The relationship between investment and centralities is strong, with edges of low centrality requiring no investment and higher-centrality edges requiring increasing investment.

1. The study investigates the length spectra of two circular dielectric microwave resonators using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The resonators are treated as flat 3D systems, and the 2D approximation of the Helmholtz equation is used with an effective index of refraction. The experimental length spectra are compared to the semiclassical trace formula for 2D dielectric resonators. The results show good agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectra.

2. The peak positions in the experimental length spectrum are slightly shifted with respect to the geometrical lengths of the periodic orbits (POs). This shift is attributed to two effects: the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and the systematic inaccuracy of the 2D approximation. The former effect is as large as 0.5% of the PO length, while the latter effect is as large as 1.5% of the PO length. The two effects cancel each other in part.

3. The study uses a 2D approximation of the Helmholtz equation with an effective index of refraction to describe the flat 3D resonators. The effective index of refraction is frequency-dependent and is calculated using the Fresnel reflection coefficients. The 2D approximation is known to be inaccurate for POs close to the critical angle. The exact trace formula for the circle is used to improve the accuracy of the calculations.

4. The experimental length spectra are compared to the exact trace formula for the circle, and the results show good agreement. The peak amplitudes of the exact trace formula are larger than those of the experimental length spectrum, which is attributed to the additional factor in the exact formula. The peak positions of the exact trace formula differ slightly from those of the experimental length spectrum, which is attributed to the systematic error of the 2D approximation.

5. The study finds that the systematic error of the 2D approximation contributes to the deviations between the peak positions of the experimental length spectrum and the trace formula. The magnitude of this error depends on the index of refraction used in the calculations. The error is as large as 0.5 mm for the POs considered in the study. The exact magnitude of the systematic error cannot be estimated a priori.

6. The study highlights the importance of considering the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction in the calculations. The frequency dependence leads to a shift of the peak positions in the length spectrum, which can be estimated using a simple 1D system with equidistant",0

1. The merger of double neutron stars, black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star are significant sources of gravitational waves, releasing a huge amount of energy in the process. The coalescence of double neutron stars may radiate about 10^46 erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory.

2. The rate at which these events occur in the local universe is a crucial parameter in determining if these mergings are potential interesting sources of gravitational waves. Despite extensive research, uncertainties persist in estimates of the double neutron star coalescence rate.

3. The authors have revisited this question, taking into account the galactic star formation history derived directly from observations and including the contribution of elliptical galaxies when estimating the mean merging rate in the local universe. Based on these results, they have predicted a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo respectively.

4. The superposition of a large number of unresolved sources at high redshifts will produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves, which can be characterized by the density parameter Ωgw. The authors have calculated the integrated gravitational flux by summing individual fluences, scaled by the ratio between the expected number of events per unit of time and the number of simulated coalescences.

1. The paper discusses the phenomenon of diffusive acceleration at Newtonian shock fronts, which is a well-studied topic with some issues still debated. The backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock is a crucial aspect, as it can change the shock structure and the spectrum of accelerated particles. The authors aim to provide an analytical treatment of shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles. They generalize previous calculations to account for both thermal particles and seed nonthermal particles.

2. The authors introduce a mathematical approach to describe the nonlinear effects of shock acceleration, including the backreaction of accelerated particles. They use a diffusion-convection equation to model the transport of particles and derive an implicit solution for the particle distribution function. The solution depends on the velocity field, which is determined by the mass and momentum conservation equations. The authors assume an adiabatic compression of the gas in the upstream region.

3. The authors discuss the role of the diffusion coefficient, which is assumed to be an increasing function of momentum. This assumption implies that high-energy particles can affect the fluid farther upstream than low-energy particles. The cosmic ray pressure is the sum of two terms: the adiabatic compression of the cosmic rays at upstream infinity and the pressure of the particles accelerated or reaccelerated at the shock.

4. The authors introduce a parameter that quantifies the relative weight of the cosmic ray pressure at upstream infinity compared to the gas pressure. They derive an integral-differential equation for the velocity field, which is nonlinear due to the backreaction of the accelerated particles. The solution of this equation provides the spectrum of the accelerated particles. The authors also discuss the connection between the compression factors at the gas subshock and at upstream infinity.

5. The authors investigate the shock modification due to the backreaction of the accelerated particles, considering two cases: reacceleration of pre-existing seed particles and acceleration of new particles from the thermal pool. They find that the critical behavior of the shock, characterized by the appearance of multiple solutions, occurs in both cases. The solutions are obtained by selecting the right pair of values for the compression parameters.

6. The authors present numerical results for the case of reacceleration of seed particles, showing that the solution moves towards larger values of the compression factor as the maximum momentum of the seed particles increases. They identify three regions of the parameter space, corresponding to different numbers of solutions. The authors also discuss the spectral characteristics of the accelerated particles for different solutions.

1. The universe is currently in an accelerating phase, which is attributed to the existence of dark energy, a mysterious energy source with negative pressure. Dark energy dominates over cold dark matter at late times, driving the universe's accelerating expansion. The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant.

2. The cosmological constant model, however, is plagued by the small observational value of dark energy density compared to the expected value from quantum field theories. Additionally, the model may suffer from the age problem, and an evolving dark energy with an equation-of-state parameter crossing -1 in the near cosmological past is favored. Alternative dark energy models have been proposed, including quintessence, phantom, k-essence, and others.

3. Teleparallel gravity, based on the Weitzenböck connection, is an alternative to general relativity, where the gravitational field is described by torsion instead of curvature. The teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but is based on torsion. One can construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion, such as f(T) gravity.

4. In f(T) gravity, the field equations are 2nd-order, making these theories simpler than other extended theories of gravity. The aim of the paper is to explore the implications of f(T) gravity on the formation of light elements in the early universe, i.e., Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). BBN provides strong evidence for the high temperatures characterizing the primordial universe.

5. The authors review f(T) gravity and its cosmological models, including the power-law, exponential, and square-root exponential models. These models are considered viable as they pass basic observational tests. The authors focus on homogeneous and isotropic geometry, considering the usual choice for the vierbeins, which corresponds to a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background metric.

They define the effective torsional equation-of-state parameter, which is responsible for the accelerated phases of the early or late universe.

1. The acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated based on measurements of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. This ""standard ruler"" scale can be measured at low redshifts in large galaxy redshift surveys, constraining the matter and energy content of the universe. However, if the CMB measurements are misled by new physics, the misinterpretation could spread to the low-redshift application and bias the inferences.

2. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality. These quantities are robustly measured in the CMB, and the actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation. The result is that even if the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB, the inferences for dark energy from the combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets are unchanged.

3. The acoustic peak method depends on measuring the sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination. Nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination, and the sound horizon integral depends only on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma. If we assume dark energy is sub-dominant at early times, the sound horizon depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality.

4. The sound speed depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and is well measured in the CMB power spectrum. The epoch of recombination, being controlled by atomic physics, is very insensitive to the cosmology, and any shift in the recombination redshift is negligible. The baryon-to-photon ratio is also exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the Silk damping tail.

5. The effect on the sound horizon is already small for the established value of the baryon-to-photon ratio, and it seems very likely that the CMB will determine the baryon-to-photon ratio to sufficient accuracy for this portion of the sound horizon computation. Information about matter-radiation equality is encoded in the amplitudes of the peaks through the manner in which the potentials evolve as they cross the horizon.

The authors aim to investigate the implications of this ansatz on neutrino masses and mixing.

They assume that the matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation, and that the diagonal elements are the neutrino masses.

They show that the ansatz can be combined with experimental data to determine the neutrino masses and mixing angles. The authors also discuss the possibility of CP violation in the neutrino sector, which could be measured in future experiments.

They find two possible solutions for the neutrino masses and mixing angles, which are compatible with experimental data. The authors also discuss the implications of these solutions for neutrinoless double beta decay.

1. The contact pattern among individuals in a population is a crucial factor in the spread of infectious diseases, and network analysis can help investigate the contact structure and its effects on disease spread. The degree distribution of a network, which is the fraction of vertices with a certain degree, can be modeled using a power-law distribution, which is common in real-world networks. Scale-free networks, which have a power-law degree distribution, can exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, with many vertices having few contacts and a few having many.

2. Epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected (SI) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models, have been used to study the transmission dynamics of diseases in scale-free networks. These models can help understand how diseases spread and how to prevent and control them. The SI model is used to study acute diseases, while the SIS model is used to study chronic diseases.

3. The Barabasi-Albert (BA) algorithm is a method for generating scale-free networks, and it can be used to study the effects of different network structures on disease spread. The BA algorithm generates networks with a power-law degree distribution, and it can be used to create networks with different numbers of vertices and edges. The networks generated by the BA algorithm have distinct structural properties, such as centralization and efficiency.

4. The spread of diseases on networks can be simulated using algorithms that take into account the probability of disease transmission and the infectious period. The simulation results can provide insights into how diseases spread and how to prevent and control them. The simulations can be carried out for different network structures and disease parameters.

5. The results of the simulations show that the prevalence of diseases tends to stabilize at a certain level, regardless of the number of vertices in the network. The prevalence also increases with the probability of disease transmission and the number of edges in the network. The simulations also show that the prevalence is higher in undirected networks than in directed networks.

The prevalence levels are also affected by the number of edges in the network, with more edges leading to higher prevalence. The simulations also show that the prevalence levels are higher in undirected networks than in directed networks.

1. The article discusses the problem of estimating the properties of a quantum channel, which is essential for any quantum communication protocol. The goal is to determine the parameters of the channel, which describe the action of the channel on a quantum system. This is a challenging task, especially when the channel is noisy and the number of available resources is limited.

2. The authors propose a protocol for estimating the properties of a quantum channel, which involves preparing a set of quantum states, sending them through the channel, and measuring the output states. The protocol is based on the idea of quantum tomography, which is a method for reconstructing the density matrix of a quantum system. The authors use a cost function to quantify the quality of the estimation.

They derive the cost functions for each channel and show that the mean error decreases with the number of resources. They also compare the results with the fidelity-based cost function.

They derive the cost function for the general channel and show that it is a generalization of the cost functions for the one-parameter channels.

The goal is to establish a complete and self-consistent phenomenology for conventional processes at 200 GeV.

2. The study aims to address several unresolved aspects of pp collisions, including the role of centrality, the nature of the underlying event, and the systematics of minimum-bias dijet production. These aspects are crucial for understanding the physics of high-energy collisions.

3. The study uses a two-component model (TCM) to describe hadron production in high-energy collisions, which consists of a soft component from longitudinal projectile-nucleon dissociation and a hard component from large-angle-scattered parton fragmentation. The TCM has been successful in describing most final-state hadron yield and spectrum systematics.

5. The study uses a per-particle measure to quantify the correlation structure, which is defined as the ratio of the correlated-pair density to the reference-pair density. This measure is used to analyze the 2D angular correlations and extract the NJ quadrupole component.

6. The study finds that the NJ quadrupole component is a prominent feature of 2D angular correlations in pp collisions, and its centrality trend is consistent with a hydrodynamic response to initial-state asymmetry. The NJ quadrupole component is also found to increase much faster than the dijet production rate with centrality.

1. The localization length of light in one-dimensional disordered systems has been numerically calculated for homogeneous and mixed stacks of layers with different indices of refraction and thicknesses. The positions of the layer boundaries have been randomly shifted with respect to ordered periodic values, introducing positional disorder in the system.

2. For homogeneous stacks, the localization length exhibits a parabolic behavior in the limit of long wavelengths and saturates for very low values of wavelength, with the transmission bands modulating the localization length and this modulation decreasing with increasing disorder. The localization length is practically independent of the disorder at the first gap.

When left-handed metamaterials are introduced in the system, the localization length behavior presents some differences, with a linear dependence on wavelength for low-disordered mixed stacks and wavelengths of several orders of magnitude greater than the grating period. The slope of this linear dependence is inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.

The localization length is affected by the symmetry of the band distribution, with irregular forms in the transmission spectrum for non-symmetric distributions, and these changes are more sensitive in mixed stacks than in homogeneous structures. The final expression for the localization length in the linear region can be written in terms of the absorption coefficient and the wavelength.",1

The standard model of cosmology, also known as the concordance model, suggests that ordinary matter makes up only 4% of the universe's total mass-energy, while dark matter and dark energy make up 23% and 73%, respectively. The existence of dark matter is supported by the observation of galaxy rotation curves and the large-scale structure of the universe. The nature of dark matter remains unknown, but it is thought to be composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).

2. The cold dark matter (CDM) model is a popular theory that attempts to explain the behavior of dark matter, but it has several limitations, including the need for dark matter to be non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation. Simulations of CDM have been successful in reproducing the large-scale structure of the universe, but they have difficulty explaining the observed rotation curves of galaxies. The CDM model also requires the existence of a large number of satellite galaxies, which are not observed.

3. The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory, proposed by Milgrom, suggests that the law of gravity needs to be modified at very low accelerations, such as those found in galaxies. MOND has been successful in explaining the rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter, but it has difficulty explaining the behavior of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe. MOND also requires the existence of a critical acceleration, below which the law of gravity is modified.

TeVeS introduces a new vector field that couples to the gravitational field, allowing it to reproduce the successes of MOND on small scales. However, TeVeS has difficulty explaining the behavior of galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe.

This approach, known as ""dark matter modification,"" suggests that dark matter is composed of particles that have a different gravitational response than normal matter. This approach has the advantage of being able to explain the behavior of dark matter on both small and large scales.

1. The study focuses on the behavior of long-chain macromolecules, specifically polyampholytes (PAs), which are chains with both positively and negatively charged monomers. The properties of PAs are determined by the sequence of charges along the chain, which can be either random or correlated. The energy of a PA is influenced by the electrostatic interactions between the charged monomers, as well as the excluded volume interactions between the monomers. The study aims to understand the behavior of PAs in different dimensions and with varying charge sequences.

2. The authors use a simplified model of PAs, where the chain is represented as a self-avoiding walk on a cubic lattice, and the charges are assigned to each monomer randomly or according to a specific sequence. The energy of the PA is calculated using a Hamiltonian that includes the electrostatic and excluded volume interactions. The study uses a combination of analytical and numerical methods to investigate the behavior of PAs. The authors also compare their results with previous studies on short-range interaction models.

3. The study finds that the ground state energy of a PA is largely determined by its net charge, with only a small dependence on the details of the charge sequence. The energy of a PA can be separated into a condensation energy, which is related to the formation of a compact state, and a surface energy, which is related to the shape of the PA. The authors find that the condensation energy is similar to that of a regular crystal, despite the random nature of the charge sequence.

4. The study also investigates the dependence of the PA's energy on its length and charge sequence. The authors find that the energy scales with the length of the chain, and that the scaling behavior is influenced by the charge sequence. The study also finds that the PA's energy is sensitive to the dimensionality of the system, with the energy increasing with decreasing dimension.

1. The paper discusses the X-ray reflection off the surface of cold disks in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black holes (GBH), focusing on the effects of thermal instability and heat conduction on the vertical structure of the disk.
2. The authors calculate the temperature profiles and optical depths of the transition layers and intermediate stable layer, and find that the existence of an intermediate stable layer enhances the emission in the 0.5-1.5 keV band.
3. The paper also discusses the line formation processes in the transition layers and intermediate stable layer, including radiative recombination and resonance line scattering, and finds that the equivalent widths of the reflected lines are notably enhanced when there is an intermediate stable layer.
4. The authors compare the predicted line features to the ""hump"" produced by Compton scattering off a cold surface and find that the strengths of reflected lines are at least comparable with those of the recombination emission lines when there is no intermediate stable layer.
5. The detectability of the predicted line features depends on whether the primary continuum is viewed directly, and the authors estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio in such a line can be sufficient for detection with current instruments.",1

1. The paper studies the transverse distribution function of the free end of a three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation and position of the second end, using the exact solution for the Green's function of the wormlike chain. The distribution function is found to possess a bimodal shape for intermediate chain lengths, with maxima at a finite value of the transverse displacement, consistent with recent studies on two-dimensional chains.
2. The paper also presents analytical results for short and large polymers, which are in complete agreement with classical works that investigated these limits using different methods, and the computation of the three-dimensional distribution function of a free polymer is in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. The results provide new insights into the behavior of semiflexible polymers, which are important for understanding biological and synthetic polymers.",1

1. The paper discusses the concept of a ""closed"" graph, which is a graph with a labeling that satisfies certain properties. A labeling of a graph is a bijection from the vertex set to the set of integers from 1 to n, where n is the number of vertices. A labeling is closed if whenever two edges have a common vertex, the labels of the edges are either both greater than or both less than the label of the common vertex. The paper aims to characterize closed graphs in terms of their properties.

2. The paper introduces the concept of a ""narrow"" graph, which is a graph where every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path. It is shown that every connected closed graph is narrow. The paper also introduces an algorithm for labeling connected graphs, which will be used to prove the main result. The algorithm labels the vertices of the graph in a specific order, starting with the vertex of minimal degree.

3. The paper proves that every connected closed graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. It also shows that the labeling produced by the algorithm is closed when the input graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. The proof involves showing that the labeling has a certain property, which is proved by induction on the number of vertices. The base case of the induction is proved by showing that the first vertex labeled by the algorithm has a certain property.

4. The paper proves the main result, which states that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. The proof involves showing that the labeling produced by the algorithm is closed when the input graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. The paper also shows that the converse is true, i.e., if the labeling produced by the algorithm is closed, then the input graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow.

5. The paper concludes by summarizing the main results and their implications. The characterization of closed graphs in terms of their properties has applications in graph theory and computer science. The paper also provides a new algorithm for labeling connected graphs, which can be used to test whether a graph is closed.",0

1. Cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at the Earth from outside, discovered in the early 20th century, and have been observed as a continuum at all energies since then. The high-energy tail of the spectrum corresponds to energies up to 3 x 10^20 eV and rates of a few particles per km^2 per century.

2. The cosmic ray spectrum has a featureless power-law energy spectrum that decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy, and the nature of the primary particle is extracted by indirect methods. For energies above a few hundred TeV, the detected particles, mainly protons, have arrival directions with a remarkably isotropic distribution.

3. The observation of high-energy cosmic rays has been reviewed, and there is very good agreement between different experiments, including the low and high-energy regions of the spectrum. There is increasing evidence for a different component of the high-energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum.

4. Composition studies have also given indications that there is a change to light element composition for energies above 10^19 eV, although this conclusion is model-dependent to some extent. The small anisotropy of 10^19 eV cosmic rays in the direction of the galactic anticenter disappears at higher energies.

5. The highest energy events detected present a serious challenge to theory, and little is known about their origin. If they are protons, they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background over distances of order 50 Mpc, but no such features are seen in the observed cosmic ray spectrum.

6. The power supply needed to keep the observed cosmic rays at the highest energies is consistent with the known power and distributions of astrophysical objects such as young pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, and active galaxies. The relative fluxes of neutrinos and protons that reach the Earth should be of order one or smaller.

7. Non-accelerating alternatives postulate that cosmic rays are products of the decay of other more massive particles produced by different mechanisms, and these models share a very similar composition dominated by photons and neutrinos. The ratio of neutrinos to protons can in principle become higher at the Earth than when they are produced if the sources are quite distant or cosmologically distributed.

1. The iron pnictides are a well-established prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with a complex magnetic behavior that is crucial to understand for the emergence of superconductivity.
2. The magnetic moments in iron pnictides are difficult to reproduce within density functional theory (DFT) and are sensitive to computational parameters, making it challenging to study their magnetic properties.
3. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful tool to study the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but it is difficult to see the magnetic anisotropy correctly in experimental spectra due to twinning of crystals.
4. Theoretical calculations using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR-GF) approach can accurately describe the magnetic phase of iron pnictides and reproduce experimental ARPES data, including the anisotropic features of the Fermi surface.

1. XB158 is a high-inclination neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) associated with the M31 globular cluster B158, exhibiting strong intensity modulation on a 2.78 hr period.
2. The X-ray source XB158 was discovered by the Einstein Observatory and has been observed by various telescopes, including XMM-Newton and Chandra, showing periodic dips in its lightcurve.
3. The dips are thought to be caused by the ""superhumping"" phenomenon, where the disk precesses due to a tidal instability, resulting in a super-orbital period.
4. The super-orbital period was predicted to be 81±3 hr based on 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamical (SPH) modeling, but the actual period was found to be 5.65±0.05 days, which is 170% longer than predicted.
5. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity of XB158 varied by a factor of 15 during the Swift observations, consistent with the range of luminosities observed in the Chandra monitoring campaign.
6. The Swift lightcurve folded on the 5.65-day period shows a sinusoidal variation, with an amplitude of 7.1±0.6×10^37 erg s^-1 around a mean luminosity of 1.43±0.04×10^37 erg s^-1.
7. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the Swift lightcurve shows a strong peak at 5.6 days, corresponding to a false alarm probability of 0.0009.
8. The longer-than-expected super-orbital period may be due to the mass ratio of the donor to the accretor being lower than assumed, and the accretor may be a more massive neutron star than assumed.
9. The findings support the hypothesis that XB158 is a short-period, low-mass ratio system, similar to other X-ray binaries such as XB146.",1

The authors analyze the symmetry properties of these systems and find that they can exhibit exact, spontaneously broken, or completely broken PT symmetry. The plaquettes are motivated by feasible experimental realizations in nonlinear optics. The authors also discuss the possibility of engineering PT-symmetric oligomers and lattices.

2. The authors derive the equations of motion for the 2D plaquettes and analyze their linear stability. They find that the plaquettes can exhibit exceptional points, where the eigenvalues of the linearized system coalesce. The authors also find that the nonlinear terms in the equations of motion can lead to the existence of stationary solutions that are not PT-symmetric. The stability of these solutions is analyzed numerically, and the authors find that some of them are stable, while others are unstable.

1. The cataclysmic variable Hu Aqr consists of a 0.80 white dwarf and a 0.18 main-sequence companion star, with two planets orbiting the binary system. The transfer of mass between the stars is mediated by gravitational waves and the strong magnetic field of the accreting star. The presence of the planets has led to a range of explanations for the irregularities in the observed-calculated variations.

2. Detailed timing analysis has concluded that the CV is orbited by two planets, with a 5.7 planet in a close orbit and a more massive 7.6 planet in a wider orbit. Although the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year timescale, a small fraction of numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability. The parameters of the planets are presented in Table [tab: huaqr].

3. The presence of planets orbiting a CV is peculiar, but it could be a natural consequence of the formation of binaries. Planetary systems orbiting CVs could be quite common, as similar timing residuals have been observed in NN Serpentis, DP Leonis, and QS Virgo. The verdict on the planets around Hu Aqr remains debated, but assuming they are real, they can constrain the CV evolution and be used to reconstruct the history of the inner binary.

4. The original binary lost more than half its mass in the common-envelope phase, causing the reduction of the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude. It is hard to imagine how a planet can survive such a turbulent past, but it could be a natural consequence of the evolution of CVs, and its survival offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and evolution of the system. The presence of the inner planet allows us to break the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow.

5. The outer planet allows us to validate the calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born. The requirement that the initial binary must have been dynamically stable further constrains the masses of the two stars and their orbital separation. The observed white dwarf mass provides an upper limit to the mass of the core of the primary star at the moment of Roche-lobe contact, and therefore also provides a minimum to the companion mass.

6. The mass loss in the common-envelope phase can be divided into two regimes: fast and slow. In the slow regime, the orbit expands adiabatically without affecting the eccentric",0

1. The NCsm/RGM approach has been extended to treat three-body cluster states, allowing for the study of nuclear systems with three-body configurations. This approach combines a microscopic cluster technique with realistic interactions and a consistent description of nucleon clusters. The method has been introduced in detail for two-body cluster bases and has been shown to work efficiently in different systems. The extension to three-body cluster states is essential for the study of nuclear systems that present such configurations.

2. The NCsm/RGM approach has been applied to the study of the 6He nucleus, which is the lightest Borromean nucleus formed by an α core and two halo neutrons. The 6He ground state has been studied within a 4He(g.s.)+n+n cluster basis, and the results are compared to NCsm calculations. The binding energy calculations are close to convergence in both NCsm/RGM and NCsm approaches. The observed difference of approximately 1 MeV is due to the excitations of the 4He core.

3. The NCsm/RGM approach has also been used to study the continuum states of 6He, which is essential for describing 6He states in the continuum. The use of three-cluster dynamics is ideal for such a study. Using continuum asymptotic conditions, the set of equations has been solved to obtain the low-energy phase shifts for different channels. Preliminary results show the experimentally well-known 2+ resonance as well as a second low-lying 0+ resonance recently measured at GANIL.

4. The NCsm/RGM approach has several advantages over other methods, including the ability to treat both bound and continuum states, and the inclusion of three-body dynamics. The obtained wave functions feature an appropriate asymptotic behavior, contrary to bound-state methods such as the NCsm. The approach is also ideal for the study of nuclear systems that present three-body configurations. The inclusion of the excitations of the core will be achieved in a future work through the use of the no-core shell model with continuum approach.

The observations were carried out on December 12, 2001, and October 27, 2000, respectively. The data were analyzed using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS) and the results were compared with previous observations. The X-ray light curves and spectra of the two GRBs were studied in detail.

2. GRB 011211 was detected by the BeppoSAX satellite on December 11, 2001, and its X-ray afterglow was observed by XMM-Newton on December 12, 2001. The X-ray light curve of GRB 011211 showed a decline during the observation, which is typical of GRB afterglows. The X-ray spectrum of GRB 011211 was found to be a power-law with a photon index of 2.16, modified by galactic absorption. No significant spectral evolution was detected during the observation.

3. GRB 001025 was detected by the RXTE All-Sky Monitor on October 25, 2000, and its X-ray afterglow was observed by XMM-Newton on October 27, 2000. The X-ray light curve of GRB 001025 did not show any significant variability during the observation. The X-ray spectrum of GRB 001025 was found to be a power-law with a photon index of 2.01, modified by galactic absorption. The X-ray flux of GRB 001025 was much lower than that of GRB 011211.

4. The X-ray spectra of both GRBs were found to be consistent with a power-law model, with no significant absorption above the galactic value. This suggests that the bursts did not occur in high-density star-forming regions. The lack of X-ray absorption in GRB 011211 is consistent with the lack of detected reddening in the spectrum of its optical afterglow. The X-ray spectra of both GRBs are typical of GRB afterglows, suggesting that they are generated by a common physical process.

1. The layered organic material AI3 has been studied since the 1980s, and recent research has focused on its low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure. AI3 is distinct from graphene, with a smaller Fermi velocity and a larger effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions. This makes AI3 an exciting material for studying strongly correlated Dirac fermions. The material also has additional massive carriers in the vicinity of the Fermi level.

2. The researchers conducted magneto-transport measurements on AI3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure, showing the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes. The interplay between these two carrier types at low energy is the main result of the study. The measured mobilities hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers. The analysis of the data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity.

3. The researchers used a low-frequency AC lock-in technique to measure the resistivities of the samples, with a magnetic field oriented along the c-axis. The pressure was applied at room temperature using a Nicral clamp cell with Daphne 7373 silicone oil as the pressure transmitting medium. The values given take into account the pressure decrease during cooling. The analysis of the data is similar to that presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems.

4. The magneto-conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor, and its analytical expression reads σxx = (neμe + nhμh) / (1 + (μeB)^2) for a single carrier system. The conductivity in AI3 has a strong 2D character, and conductivity is shown both as 3D conductivity and as 2D conductivity of each BEDT-TTF plane. The two ""plateaus"" observed in the magneto-conductivity curve indicate the existence of two different carrier types with significantly different mobilities.

5. The researchers extracted the mobilities, zero-field conductivities, and carrier densities of each carrier type by fitting the magneto-conductivity curve. The temperature dependence of the carrier density is a signature that the temperature is higher than the Fermi temperature for both carrier types even at the lowest measured temperature. The carrier density can be calculated from the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the density of states for massive and Dirac carriers.

1. The study focuses on Fe-based superconductors (FeBS) with unconventional superconducting states, and the origin of this state is still debated. The FeBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, with a square lattice of iron as the basic element. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe 3d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets and two electron sheets.

2. The nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, resulting in different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation and distinct superconducting gap symmetries. The RPA-SF approach gives an extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets, while orbital fluctuations promote a sign-preserving s-wave symmetry. Probing the gap structure can help elucidate the underlying mechanism.

3. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool to study the spin response in normal and superconducting states of FeBS, as it carries information about the gap structure. Many reports have shown a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems, which is commonly explained by the spin resonance appearing due to the s± state. However, recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy have raised questions about this explanation.

4. The study uses two types of tight-binding models for the two-dimensional iron layer: a four-band model and a five-orbital model. The four-band model is simple enough to gain a qualitative description of the spin response, but it lacks the orbital content of the bands. The five-orbital model, on the other hand, includes all five iron 3d-orbitals and is based on the fit to the DFT band structure for LaFeAsO.

5. The calculation of the spin susceptibility in the four-band model shows that for the s± state, the spin resonance peak appears at a frequency below the gap scale, while for the s++ state, the susceptibility increases gradually with frequency. In the case of unequal gaps, the spin resonance peak shifts to lower frequencies, and an additional hump structure appears at higher frequencies.

6. The five-orbital model is used to demonstrate where the new energy scale is coming from. The energy spectrum near the Fermi level in the superconducting state shows two energy scales, which are connected with hole and electron bands. The indirect gap scale is determined by the sum of gaps on two different FS sheets connected",0

1. The presence of impurities in a quantum system can significantly modify its spectrum, coherence, and transport properties. In one and two dimensions, all states are exponentially localized in the absence of interactions, while a mobility edge exists in three dimensions. Correlated impurities can lead to the appearance of delocalized states in the spectrum.

2. The random dimer model (RDM) and dual random dimer model (DRDM) have been studied in one dimension, where correlated disorder introduces delocalized states. In two dimensions, the effect of correlations is largely unexplored, except for the case of a speckle potential and pseudo-2D random dimer lattices with separable dimensions.

3. The authors introduce a 2D generalization of the DRDM, where impurities cannot be first neighbors and each impurity modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites. Using a decimation and renormalization technique, they show that there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent and the states around this energy are delocalized.

4. The resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as the DRDM in 1D. The authors then consider the case of a weakly interacting Bose gas confined on such a potential. Within a Gutzwiller approach, they show that the effect of the 2D-DRDM is to drive the homogeneity of the ground state.

5. The disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, and enhances both in correspondence of the resonance energy of the 2D-DRDM single-particle Hamiltonian. The dependence of such quantities on the interaction strength can be explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion.

6. The authors analyze the localization properties of the model using the inverse participation ratio (IPR) and find that the states are delocalized in the energy region around the resonance energy. They also study the behavior of the IPR as a function of the energy and find a high-energy band of localized states created by the disorder.

7. In the interacting regime, the authors quantify the extent of delocalization of the ground state using a many-body IPR and find a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the disorder strength. The minimum of the many-body IPR corresponds to a region where the ground state is more homogeneous.

1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a method of secure communication that uses quantum mechanics to encode and decode messages. QKD is often said to be unconditionally secure, but in practice, it is difficult to meet the requirements for security. The security of QKD can be compromised by imperfections in the devices used, and attacks on QKD systems have been proposed and demonstrated. To combat these attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proof and experimental countermeasures have been proposed.

2. Measurement-Device-Independent QKD (MDI-QKD) is a protocol that removes the detector side-channel attacks by using a measurement unit (MU) that is not trusted. In MDI-QKD, Alice and Bob send quantum signals to the MU, which performs a measurement and announces the outcome. Alice and Bob then use the outcome to generate a secure key. MDI-QKD has been shown to be secure against general attacks, but it requires a trusted source of quantum signals.

3. The authors propose two schemes for MDI-QKD using phase encoding, which is a method of encoding quantum information onto the phase of a light pulse. The first scheme uses a phase-locking technique to ensure that the phases of the light pulses are correlated, while the second scheme uses a phase-to-polarization converter to convert the phase encoding into polarization encoding. Both schemes are shown to be secure against general attacks.

4. The security of the schemes is proven using a virtual protocol that involves a quantum coin, which is a quantum system that is used to determine the basis of the measurement. The security proof shows that the schemes are secure against any attack that is allowed by quantum mechanics. The proof also takes into account the imperfections of the devices used, such as the basis-dependent flaw.

5. The authors simulate the key generation rate of the schemes using typical experimental parameters and find that the schemes can achieve secure key generation over long distances. The key generation rate is affected by the intensity of the light pulses, the dark counting rate of the detectors, and the alignment errors of the optical components.

6. The authors also discuss the importance of estimating the phase error rate, which is the rate of errors in the sifted key due to the phase encoding. The phase error rate is estimated using a bound on the fidelity between the density matrices of the quantum states in the two bases. The bound is derived using the Bloch sphere bound and is shown to be tight in the limit of large numbers of successful events.

1. The formation of massive stars is still not well understood, despite their importance in shaping the evolution of galaxies. Observations of massive protostars are challenging due to their distance and clustered mode of formation. Recent advances in instrumentation have enabled high-resolution imaging of these regions, providing new insights into the formation process. The study of hot molecular cores, where massive stars are formed, can help distinguish between competing formation models.

2. The mid-infrared window offers a powerful view of hot molecular cores, allowing for the detection of massive star formation. Methanol masers are exclusive tracers of massive star formation regions and are often offset from UCHII regions. Observations of five star-forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission have revealed large-scale properties of these regions. The study aimed to resolve the embedded sources inside the cores at mid-infrared wavelengths.

3. The observations were conducted using the Michelle instrument on the Gemini North telescope, with high spatial resolution and sensitivity. The data were obtained in four N-band silicate filters and one Q-band filter, with a total integration time of 300 seconds. The standard chop-nod technique was used to minimize off-field contamination, and the spatial resolution was calculated from standard star observations.

4. The results show that the methanol masers are found closest to the brightest mid-infrared point source, which has a temperature sufficient to evaporate methanol ice from dust grains. The spatial distribution of point sources within the protocluster is similar between the clumps, with close point sources toward the cluster center. The sources have luminosities sufficient to pump the masing transition, and conditions models suggest are required for such emission. The study found that massive stars favor cluster centers, but it is unclear whether they form there or migrate from outside.

5. The study used a simple-harmonic model of ballistic motion to consider the motion of sources within the cores. The time required for migration from the edge to the center is comparable to the predicted hot molecular core lifetime. Any sources having migrated to the center would have acquired a velocity with respect to the clump. The study also found that multiple systems are bound from birth, and some of the observed sources may belong to multiple systems, even though companions may lie below the detection limit.

1. The paper discusses the reconstruction of various cosmological models in the context of @xmath0 gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity that includes a coupling between curvature and matter components. The authors use a reconstruction scheme to obtain de Sitter, power-law, phantom, and non-phantom solutions, as well as @xmath13cdm models.

2. The stability of these solutions is analyzed using first-order perturbations, and the results show that some models are stable against linear perturbations, while others are not. The authors conclude that the reconstruction and stability analysis can restrict the viability of @xmath0 gravity.

1. The proposed setup involves a hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator (qd-nr) system to detect Majorana fermions (mfs) in iron chains on a superconducting Pb surface. The qd is coupled to both the nr and the nearby mf, and the system is probed using optical pump-probe technology. The qd-nr coupling and qd-mf coupling are two kinds of coupling in the hybrid system.

2. The absorption and dispersion spectra of the probe field are calculated as a function of the probe detuning under different conditions, including without considering any coupling, with qd-nr coupling, with qd-mf coupling, and with both couplings. The results show that the qd-nr coupling induces two sharp peaks in the spectra, while the qd-mf coupling induces a signature of mfs. The two kinds of coupling can be distinguished by their effects on the spectra.

3. The qd-mf coupling strength can be determined by measuring the distance of the two peaks in the probe absorption spectrum, which follows a nearly linear relationship with the coupling strength. The coupled mfs mode and uncoupled mfs mode can be distinguished by their effects on the spectra. The qd-mf coupling can induce a phenomenon similar to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic systems.

4. The role of the nr in the hybrid system is to enhance the sensitivity for detecting mfs by narrowing and increasing the exciton resonance spectrum. The nr behaves as a phonon cavity, which can amplify the coherent interaction between the qd and mf. The exciton resonance spectrum can be used to read out the exciton states of the qd.

5. The proposed all-optical means to detect mfs is based on the quantum interference between the nr and the beat of the two optical fields. The concept is the first all-optical means to probe mfs and provides a platform for applications in all-optically controlled topological quantum computing based on mfs. The authors acknowledge support from several funding agencies.

6. The qd-mf coupling in the proposed system is relatively weak, but it can be enhanced by embedding a metal nanoparticle-quantum dot (mnp-qd) complex in the nr. The surface plasmon induced by the mnp can enhance the coherent optical property of the qd, making it more robust for probing mfs. The qd-nr system can be used to detect mfs in various topological systems.

1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by the absence of hydrogen and strong silicon lines in their spectra, making them brighter than most other types of supernovae. They exhibit uniform light curves, making them useful as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from its companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes. This model has been improved by introducing the stellar wind from the WD while it accretes materials from the companion.

2. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. This model also predicts which companion stars lead to SNe Ia. However, this scenario has not been confirmed by observations, which require the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site. The companion star's velocity and distance should be consistent with the distance to the supernova remnant (SNR). The expected stellar mass in thick disk stars within a certain radius is low, making the thick disk star alternative unlikely.

3. A direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta is proposed. A hint was dropped by observations of a star called S-M star discovered near a Type Ia SNR 1006. The S-M star was proved not to be the companion of this supernova by investigating features of Fe II absorption lines in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. The broad wings of the absorption lines are likely formed by Fe II in the ejecta of SNR 1006. When a star is inside the ejecta of SNe Ia, photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us, resulting in a broad wing only in the blue side.

4. The absorption line with only a blue wing enables us to identify companion stars of SNe Ia. However, UV observations are difficult from the ground, and companion stars on the evolutionary paths suggested by the scenario may not be bright in the UV range. Therefore, the focus is on absorption lines in the visible range, and the corresponding transitions need to be from the ground state because most Fe ions in the ejecta are expected to be in the ground state. Only Fe I can produce such absorption lines in SNe Ia eject",0

1. The paper discusses the dynamics of entanglement in a cascaded qubit system, where two qubits are coupled through the one-way exchange of photons. The system is open, meaning it interacts with its environment, and the authors use quantum trajectory theory to study the evolution of entanglement. They find that the system exhibits a bimodal behavior, where it either evolves into a maximally entangled bell state or enters an entangled-state cycle. The cycle involves the system switching between two orthogonal bell states while emitting a continuous stream of photons.

2. The authors analyze the system's behavior at resonance, where the coupling between the qubits is optimal, and find that the system's evolution is characterized by a perpetual switching between two bell states. They also study the case where the inter-cavity coupling is imperfect, and find that the system settles into one of two distinct cycles, involving either symmetric or antisymmetric bell states. The choice of cycle is random and depends on the photon counting record. The system's evolution is influenced by the competition between the periods of evolution between quantum jumps and the jumps themselves.

3. The authors use a graphical representation of the system's phase space to visualize the evolution of the system. They find that the system's state is confined to two subspaces, which are linked by quantum jumps. The system's evolution is governed by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, which causes the system's state to decay and eventually jump to another subspace. The authors also study the system's behavior away from resonance and find that the system evolves to a unique steady state.

4. The paper highlights the importance of considering the environment in the study of entanglement dynamics. The authors show that the system's evolution is influenced by the photon counting record, which is a measure of the system's interaction with its environment. They also demonstrate that the system's entanglement can be characterized using quantum trajectory theory, which provides a more detailed understanding of the system's evolution than traditional master equation approaches. Overall, the paper provides new insights into the dynamics of entanglement in open quantum systems.",1

1. The paper discusses the anisotropy of infrared emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and its relation to the unification scheme. The authors use a sample of quasars and radio galaxies at redshift 0.4 to study the intrinsic anisotropy of the dust torus. They find that the ratio of type 1 to type 2 AGN emission decreases from 20 to 2 between 2 and 8 microns.

2. The authors analyze the silicate feature in the sample averages and find a ""shift"" of the central peak of the silicate emission feature with respect to the center of the absorption feature. The resulting central wavelengths are in agreement with previous reports. This suggests that the dust chemistry within the torus changes with luminosity.

3. The paper discusses the implications of the anisotropy on the selection of AGN samples. The authors argue that flux-limited mid-infrared selected samples are potentially biased towards type 1 AGN, and that the anisotropy has to be taken into account when comparing type 1 and type 2 AGN. They also compare their results to other anisotropy estimators, such as the X-ray/mid-infrared correlation.

4. The authors use a clumpy torus model to reproduce the observed type 1/type 2 ratio and find that it is consistent with the model. They also discuss the possibility that the difference in anisotropy between their sample and a similar study of nearby Seyferts may be due to a receding torus model with luminosity-dependent obscuration.

5. The paper concludes that the relatively small degree of anisotropy is consistent with the torus being clumpy rather than smooth, and that the results are consistent with upper limits derived from the X-ray/mid-infrared correlation of local Seyfert galaxies. The authors also acknowledge the limitations of their study and suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the anisotropy of AGN emission.",0

1. The security of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) systems is compromised by Local Oscillator (LO) intensity fluctuations, which can be exploited by an eavesdropper (Eve) to intercept secret keys. Eve can reduce the LO intensity to hide her attack, making it difficult for Alice and Bob to detect. This attack is particularly effective in reverse reconciliation protocols.

2. The traditional security analysis of CVQKD systems assumes a constant LO intensity, which is not the case in practical implementations. The LO intensity fluctuation can be simulated by Eve to hide her attack, and Bob's measurements without monitoring LO intensity can be compromised. This can lead to an overestimation of the secret key rate and a false sense of security.

3. The authors analyze the effect of LO intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate estimation for reverse and direct reconciliation protocols. They show that Eve can intercept partial or total secret keys without being detected by reducing the LO intensity. The analysis highlights the importance of monitoring LO intensity fluctuations in CVQKD systems.

4. The authors conclude that LO intensity fluctuations open a loophole for Eve to attack practical CVQKD systems, especially in low-channel-transmission or long-distance communication scenarios. Accurate monitoring of LO intensity is crucial to ensure the security of CVQKD systems. The authors also discuss the challenges of implementing LO intensity monitoring in practical systems.",1

1. The ADIPLS code is a tool for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models. The code offers flexibility in the choice of integration method and can determine all frequencies of a given model in a specified range of degree and frequency. The code's simplicity has been compromised by its long development period, but it remains a powerful tool for asteroseismology. The code's documentation is extensive and includes a review of adiabatic stellar oscillations and comparisons with other codes.

2. The code uses a set of dimensionless variables to define the equilibrium model and oscillations, which are inspired by the work of Christensen-Dalsgaard. The equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations are expressed in terms of these variables, and the code can solve them using two different techniques: a shooting method and a relaxation technique. The code can also deal with envelope models with arbitrary base points and can compute modes of arbitrarily high degree. The code's numerical treatment of the transition between different variables has required careful consideration.

3. The code has options for improving the precision of the computed frequencies, including the use of a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation. The code can also redistribute the mesh to take into account the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions. The code's precision and accuracy are important considerations, and the code provides measures of the reliability of the computed frequencies. The code can also compute the normalized inertia and mode mass of the modes.

4. The code has undergone several revisions and has options for future development, including the installation of a fourth-order integration scheme and the use of a new classification scheme for dipolar modes. The code has also been extended to compute rotational splittings and kernels for a given rotation profile.

1. The activity inside gas-rich galaxy disks is characterized by highly structured HI distributions, featuring cavities, shells, and supershells. These features were first discovered in the Milky Way and have since been found in other spiral galaxies. The HI supershells are thought to be expanding due to a large input of energy, but the source of this energy is still debated. Two main classes of explanations have been proposed: internal and external sources.

2. The internal source model suggests that starbursts drive stellar winds and supernova explosions, which inject energy into the HI gas. This model is supported by observations of HI supershells in galaxies with high star formation rates. However, the energy required to create the largest HI supershells is difficult to explain using this model. Additionally, some galaxies with HI supershells do not show signs of recent star formation.

3. The external source model proposes that the energy comes from the infall of massive gas clouds onto the galaxy disk. This model is supported by observations of HI supershells in galaxies with interacting companions. However, some galaxies with HI supershells do not have nearby companions, making this model less likely. The infall of gas clouds would also be difficult to detect.

4. A new explanation for HI supershells is proposed, involving radio jets ejected from the galactic nucleus. These jets can inflate bubbles of hot plasma, which sweep up HI gas and create supershells. This model can account for the large energies required to create HI supershells and can explain why some galaxies with HI supershells do not show signs of recent star formation or interacting companions.

5. Radio jets are known to occur in some spiral galaxies, and can create bubbles and shells of hot plasma. These features are similar to HI supershells, but are composed of different material. The jets can also create large-scale outflows of gas, which can interact with the HI gas in the disk. This interaction can lead to the formation of HI supershells.

6. The galaxy NGC 3556 is a good example of a galaxy with HI supershells that cannot be explained by the internal or external source models. The HI supershells in this galaxy are large and energetic, and are located at the edges of the galaxy disk. The galaxy does not show signs of recent star formation or interacting companions, making the radio jet model a more likely explanation.

2. However, subsequent studies revealed differences between dSph galaxies and globular clusters, including the presence of intermediate-age populations and distinct characteristics of variable stars.
3. The CMD of Leo I, a dSph galaxy, shows a prominent red clump (RC) and a large number of intermediate-age main-sequence stars, indicating a complex star formation history.
4. The galaxy lacks a conspicuous horizontal branch (HB), which may suggest that it has only a small fraction of very old stars.
5. The RC of Leo I is densely populated and extended in luminosity, indicating an extended star formation history with a large intermediate-age component.
6. The brightest stars in the main sequence have ages similar to those of the blue-loop stars, which are a few hundred million years old.
7. Some of the variable stars found in Leo I may be classical Cepheids instead of anomalous Cepheids, with periods compatible with those found by Hodge & Wright (1978).
8. The RGB of Leo I is relatively blue, characteristic of a system with low metallicity, and the metallicity estimates range from [Fe/H] = -1.8 to -1.0 dex.

The article discusses the properties of the fractional Laplacian operator with a drift term, specifically the existence of a principal eigenvalue and its relation to the existence of first integrals. The operator is defined as the closure of a bilinear form on a Sobolev space, and its properties are studied using the theory of quadratic forms. The authors also consider the connection to the classical Laplacian and the role of the drift term in the operator.

2. The authors introduce the notion of a first integral, which is a function that satisfies a certain equation involving the drift term and the fractional Laplacian. They show that the existence of a non-trivial first integral is equivalent to the boundedness of the principal eigenvalue of the operator. The first integral is also related to the flow lines of the drift term.

3. The article discusses the properties of the Green function and the transition density of the process associated with the operator. The Green function is shown to be symmetric and compact, and its properties are used to study the eigenvalues of the operator. The transition density is also studied, and its connection to the Green function is established.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of variational autoencoders in capturing the underlying structure of the data and identifying phase transitions.

2. The authors begin by discussing the challenges of inferring macroscopic properties from microscopic descriptions in physics, particularly in the context of phase transitions. They highlight the importance of identifying order parameters, which can be difficult to determine in certain systems.

3. The paper focuses on the Ising model, a well-studied model in physics, to test the ability of unsupervised learning algorithms to identify phase transitions. The authors use Monte Carlo simulations to generate sample configurations of the Ising model at different temperatures.

4. The authors compare the performance of different unsupervised learning algorithms, including principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis, traditional autoencoders, and variational autoencoders. They find that variational autoencoders outperform the other algorithms in capturing the underlying structure of the data.

5. The authors demonstrate that the variational autoencoder can learn a latent representation of the Ising model that is closely related to the order parameter. They show that the reconstruction loss of the autoencoder can be used as a universal indicator of phase transitions.

6. The authors also apply the variational autoencoder to the XY model, which has a continuous symmetry, and find that it can still capture the phase transition. They demonstrate that the autoencoder can learn a latent representation that is related to the order parameter of the XY model.

The authors discuss the advantages of using variational autoencoders over traditional autoencoders, including the ability to handle nonlinear features in the data and to scale well to large datasets. They also highlight the potential of using deep convolutional autoencoders to promote locality in feature selection.

4. The authors consider two-partite qubit states and construct a QCM that copies the first component of the state, and the quality of the cloning depends on the quantum state.

2. The inventory of baryons observable locally falls short of the total inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations, leaving open the possibility of a significant baryonic component of dark matter.
3. The gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within dense gas clouds could be a way to detect dark matter, and previous calculations of gamma-ray spectra from cosmic-ray irradiation assumed single interactions only.
4. The authors used a Monte Carlo simulation code, GEANT4, to derive gamma-ray production spectra from cosmic-ray interactions with dense gas clouds, taking into account cascade processes and particle transport.
5. The resulting gamma-ray spectra show a broad peak at around 100 MeV and dominate above about 200 MeV, with the bremsstrahlung and annihilation contributions being negligible in the limit of small column density.
6. The authors calculated the diffuse gamma-ray emission from the galaxy using the gamma-ray production spectra obtained, and found that the predicted gamma-ray spectrum for each case is a function of the cosmic-ray intensity and the mean density in gas clouds of column density.
7. The galactic variation of the cosmic-ray spectra is not well constrained by existing data, and the authors adopted a simplifying assumption that the shape of the cosmic-ray spectra is the same everywhere in the galaxy, with variations only in normalization.
8. The authors computed the quantity I, which characterizes the properties of the galaxy, and found that the constraint imposed by the gamma-ray data permits the galaxy's dark halo to be entirely baryonic, provided the individual components have a column density above a certain threshold.
9. The gamma-ray data on the inner galactic disk indicate that all of the galaxy's dark halo may be made of dense clouds of column density above a certain threshold.

1. The study investigates the behavior of colloidal crystals in a rotating electric field, which can be used to create tunable diffraction gratings for display applications. The researchers use a combination of experiments and Monte Carlo simulations to model the system, taking into account the electrostatic repulsions and dipolar attractions between the colloidal particles. They find that the lattice parameter of the crystal can be controlled by the strength of the electric field.

2. The simulations are able to capture the behavior of the system in a reasonably quantitative manner, although some deviations are observed at high field strengths. The researchers attribute these deviations to the limitations of their pairwise treatment of the dipolar attractions and the assumptions made in their derivation of the electrostatic interactions. They also note that the effective colloid charge and debye length may vary across the system, which could affect the accuracy of their results.

3. The study finds that the lattice tunability is maximized for particles of approximately 1 to 1.5 microns in diameter, and that higher field strengths applied to smaller particles can increase the lattice tunability. However, higher field strengths are not practical in the current experimental system, and the researchers suggest that metal-coated colloids could be used to reduce the required field strength. The methodology developed in this study could be useful for engineering applications, such as creating tunable diffraction gratings for display devices.",1

1. The soft X-ray transient Aql X-1 is a neutron star binary system that exhibits properties similar to those of persistent low-mass X-ray binaries. Its large variations in accretion rate allow for the investigation of different regimes of neutron star behavior. The origin of its low-luminosity X-ray emission in quiescence is still unclear.

2. Aql X-1's outbursts are characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with a type I X-ray burst detected during the declining phase, indicating the presence of a neutron star. The X-ray spectrum changes from soft to hard as the luminosity drops, and the power-law component hardens in quiescence. The equivalent radius of the blackbody component decreases from the decay phase to quiescence.

3. The BeppoSAX observations of Aql X-1's outburst decay show a sharp flux decrease, followed by a constant quiescent luminosity. The X-ray spectrum in quiescence is consistent with a blackbody plus power-law model, with a harder power-law component than in the decay phase. The quiescent luminosity is likely powered by a radio pulsar enshrouded by matter outflowing from the companion star.

The neutron star's magnetic field and spin period can be inferred from the observed luminosity and QPO frequency.

The supernova was classified as Type Ib, and its spectra showed broad features and strong narrow emission lines. The event was unusual due to the presence of a luminous blue continuum and a red wing in the optical spectra. The supernova was also observed in X-ray, UV, and IR bands.

2. The bolometric luminosity of SN 2006jc was constructed from the UV, optical, and IR observations. The luminosity was estimated by integrating the fluxes over the observed wavebands. The UV luminosity was estimated from the optical luminosity at other epochs. The bolometric luminosity was dominated by the IR emission at late epochs.

3. The IR spectroscopy and photometry were obtained with the AZT-24 and Magnum telescopes. The IR emission was found to originate from amorphous carbon grains with two temperatures. The hot carbon dust was formed in the supernova ejecta and cooled down gradually. The warm carbon dust was suggested to be a supernova light echo of the circumstellar matter (CSM) carbon dust.

The model with an initial mass of 40 M⊙ was selected as a representative of a typical star becoming a WC Wolf-Rayet star. The mass at the presupernova stage was 10.9 M⊙ due to strong mass loss. The star had a WC-rich envelope and CSM.

3. The article provides a combinatorial formula for the rank of the hypergeometric system in terms of the ranking lattices, which are a collection of integral points in the parameter space.
4. The authors show that the rank of the hypergeometric system is constant on each ranking slab, which is a stratum in the coarsest stratification of the exceptional arrangement that respects the arrangements of the ranking lattices.
5. The article also discusses the relationship between the exceptional arrangement and the ranking arrangement, and provides a criterion for the rank stratification of the exceptional arrangement to refine its rank stratification.

1. The paper proposes a qubit controlled by a symmetry breaking effect in a triangular triple quantum dot (tqd) system, where each dot contains one spin and the qubit is encoded in the doublet subspace.
2. The qubit states are controlled by applied gate potentials that break the triangular symmetry, and the exchange couplings are modified by the orientation of the electric field with respect to the triangular axes.
3. The qubit can be manipulated by quick impulses of the electric field, allowing for the performance of Pauli X and Z gate operations, which can be composed to give full unitary control of the single qubit.
4. A new method for read-out of the qubit states is proposed, using electric transport through tqd and the doublet blockade effect, which is compatible with pure electrical manipulations and does not require spin-to-charge conversion.
5. The doublet blockade effect is related to an asymmetry of tunnel rates between the doublet states and the electrodes, and can be used to detect the qubit states in both triangular and linear tqd systems.
6. The paper also considers the time-dependent electron transport in the doublet blockade regime, providing information about dynamics of the qubit, coherent oscillations, and relaxation processes due to the presence of the electrodes.
7. The role of leakage processes from the doublet to two-electron states is studied, and it is found that the leakage is larger for the triplet case due to activation of the quadruplet state.
8. The paper also investigates mixing of the doublet subspaces with different spin orientations caused by spin-flip processes in the electrodes, finding that the total mixing time is very long, which is promising for manipulation and read-out of the qubit.",1

1. Symbiotic systems (SS) consist of a white dwarf (WD), a red giant (RG) star, and circumstellar and circumbinary nebulae, emitting radiation across a wide frequency range. The Z Andromedae (Z And) binary system is a well-studied SS, with a cool giant and a hot compact component. The system has exhibited multiple periods of activity, including a 1984-1986 outburst.

2. The 1984-1986 event was characterized by two maxima in the visual magnitude profile, leading to an ambiguous interpretation of the outburst as a double or disturbed single event. Fernández-Castro et al. (1995) suggested that a drop in the WD radiation flux could have provoked the observed trend in the light curve. They also proposed that a shell of material was ejected during each of the two outbursts.

3. The brightness of the 1984-1986 event was exceptionally low, but it was monitored closely by spectral observations. The spectra are rich in lines, allowing for detailed modeling of the physical conditions in the nebulae. The aim of the study is to reveal unpredicted episodes by modeling the spectra.

4. The stellar wind of the cool giant has a velocity of 25 km/s, and varying the wind velocity changes the accretion regime from disk to wind accretion. This is accompanied by a jump in the accretion rate, increasing the hydrogen burning rate. An optical thick wind forms from the WD, revealed by UV and optical spectra during the 2000-2002 outburst.

5. The shocks derived from WD and RG wind collision yield an increase in the system's luminosity. This hypothesis is strengthened by Fernández-Castro et al. (1995), who did not find evidence for an accretion disk at the 1984-1986 epoch but suggested collision episodes. The collision of the winds leads to two shock fronts between the stars.

6. The input parameters for modeling the line spectra include the shock velocity, preshock density, preshock magnetic field, color temperature of the hot star, and ionization parameter. The geometrical thickness of the emitting nebula, dust-to-gas ratio, and abundances of elements are also accounted for. The observations at different epochs of the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED) are reproduced by models constrained by the fit of the line ratios.

1. The study investigates the frequency- and electric field-dependent conductivity of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks with varying densities. The networks are prepared by spraying SWCNTs on a substrate, and their density is controlled by the solution concentration and spraying time. The frequency-dependent conductivity is measured using a Corbino reflectometry setup, and the electric field-dependent conductivity is measured using a standard 4-probe method. The results show that the onset frequency increases with the film thickness, while the length scale extracted from the electric field-dependent measurement decreases.

2. The frequency-dependent conductivity of the SWCNT networks is found to fit well to the extended pair approximation model, which is commonly used to describe the behavior of disordered systems. The onset frequency is found to increase with the dc sheet conductance, and a linear relation is observed between the two. The results are compared to those of polymer-nanotube composites, and a universal relationship between the onset frequency and dc conductance is observed. The difference in intercepts is attributed to the different types of nanotubes used.

3. The study also investigates the scaling behavior of the conductance and frequency for SWCNT networks. The data show a scaling behavior with all data sets falling on the same master curve. The correlation length is defined as the distance between connections in the sample, and it is found to decrease with increasing film thickness. The onset frequency is expected to be the frequency where carriers scan an average distance of order of the correlation length.

4. The electric field-dependent conductance is measured for SWCNT films of various thicknesses, and a nonlinear behavior is observed. The nonlinear behavior is found to depend on the film thickness, and the critical field is larger for thicker samples and smaller for thin samples. The length scale extracted from the electric field-dependent measurement is found to decrease with increasing film thickness. An empirical relation is proposed between the onset frequency and the length scale, which is consistent with the experimental data.",1

1. The proposed scheme implements a three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) coupled to a single-mode superconducting resonator. The algorithm involves three-qubit phase gates and single-qubit gates, which can be performed with high fidelity and speed. The scheme does not require adjustment of level spacing during operation, slowly changing Rabi frequencies, or second-order detuning. The implementation time is significantly faster, with an operation time of the order of nanoseconds.

2. The three-qubit phase gate is implemented using a series of microwave pulses and resonant interactions between the SQUIDs and the resonator. The gate operation involves eight steps, including the application of single-qubit gates and three-qubit phase gates. The fidelity of the three-qubit phase gate is affected by the decay of the cavity field and the relevant level, as well as unwanted off-resonant interactions during the gate implementation. The effects of these imperfections on the fidelity of the gate are analyzed and discussed.

3. The implementation of the three-qubit Grover's algorithm is simulated, taking into account the effects of decay and imperfections. The results show that the marked state can be searched with high fidelity even in the presence of imperfections. The fidelity of the search state decreases as a function of iterations, but the success probability of finding the target state remains high. The effects of cavity decay and level decay on the fidelity of the search state are also analyzed.

4. The proposed scheme is compared to other implementations of Grover's algorithm, including a recent study using cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) with Rydberg atoms. The advantages of the proposed scheme include faster implementation time, tolerance for non-uniform device parameters, and the ability to accommodate unwanted off-resonant interactions. The scheme is also compared to other implementations using superconducting qubits, including a recent study using a controllable Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme for implementing Grover's algorithm with high fidelity and speed.",1

1. The many-body effects on XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra were studied in the 1970s, particularly the effects of singularities near edges in absorption and emission spectra. The conduction-band electrons can have various effects on the XPS peak from the core level, including a shift to higher kinetic energy due to screening of the core hole.

2. The excitation process is considered sudden, resulting in shake-up effects in the form of single-particle and collective excitations, which contribute to the tailing of the XPS peak. The electrons contributing to the shake-up effects are those in the valence and conduction bands.

3. The core-hole potential is approximated with a pure Coulomb potential, and the Hamiltonian for the system is used to derive the XPS line shape. The dynamical structure factor, related to the dielectric function, is used to describe the excitation spectrum of the electrons.

4. The structure factor is nonzero in two regions: one for electron-hole pairs and one for plasmons, which are bosons that can be treated as independent. The boson dispersion curve is used to describe the plasmons.

5. The adiabatic approximation is used to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, resulting in a constant energy term that represents the relaxation energy, or the energy gain when electrons relax around the core hole. This energy shift is the XPS peak shift towards higher kinetic energy.

6. The sudden approximation is used to derive the Green's function, which is then used to calculate the XPS spectrum. The Green's function is expressed in terms of the boson creation and annihilation operators.

7. The XPS spectrum is calculated using the Fourier transform of the Green's function, which involves the satellite generator that describes the plasmon excitations. The result is a typical 2D plasmon dispersion curve.

8. The XPS spectrum is generalized to include all excitation processes in the system by replacing the boson propagator with the dynamical structure factor and the coupling constant with the interaction potential. The result is an expression for the XPS spectrum that reflects the density of states of the core electron.

9. The final expression for the XPS spectrum involves an integral over time, with the integrand containing the cosine of the energy difference and the satellite generator, as well as an exponential decay term.",0

2. The authors derive the Fokker-Planck equation describing the dynamics of the number of individuals of one genotype in the limit of large population sizes.
3. The quality of the Fokker-Planck approach is quantified for an example, showing that the difference between simulation data and theoretical solution becomes almost undetectable for population sizes larger than 10^4.
4. The individual effects of selection, mean mutation rate, mutation difference, and genetic drift are identified and the stationary probability distribution is derived.
5. Asymmetries in mutation probabilities can induce the shifting of existing stable points of the dynamics to new positions and lead to the emergence of new stable points.
6. Dynamic fitness can lead to multiple stable points of the dynamics induced by selection and genetic drift, with an example showing three stable points.
7. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of stable points that the dynamics can exhibit, as demonstrated by an example with periodic interaction functions.
8. The results suggest that in real biological systems, multiple metastable equilibria may exist whenever species interact in a way complex enough to imply a fitness that nonlinearly depends on frequency.

1. The phase-field method is a popular approach for simulating microstructure formation during solidification, but it has limitations and challenges. The method's algorithmic simplicity makes it appealing, but it requires careful consideration of its underlying assumptions. The phase-field equations can be written down using simple rules, but their detailed properties are only apparent through mathematical analysis. This analysis can be quite involved, making it difficult to perceive the limits of the method's applicability.

2. The phase-field model needs to bridge the scale gap between the physical solid-liquid interface thickness and the typical scale of microstructures. This is achieved by increasing the interface width in the model, which magnifies any physical effects due to interface diffuseness. To guarantee precise simulations, all these effects must be controlled and eliminated. The thin-interface limit is a tool used to achieve this.

3. The thin-interface limit involves analyzing the phase-field model under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale. This yields effective boundary conditions at the macroscale, which contain all effects of the finite interface thickness. However, this approach has limitations, and it is not possible to eliminate all effects of the finite interface thickness simultaneously.

4. One of the challenges is the temperature jump at the interface, which is proportional to the velocity, interface thickness, and difference of two integrals. This effect is physically correct but generates problems for simulations. An antitrapping current can be introduced to eliminate this effect, but it is not a general solution. The antitrapping current is proportional to the interface velocity and can be used to adjust the temperature jump at the interface.

5. Another challenge is the kapitza resistance, which is a surface thermal resistance that arises due to the finite interface thickness. This effect is also proportional to the interface thickness and can be eliminated using a different approach. However, the kapitza resistance cannot be eliminated by the antitrapping current, and a general solution to eliminate both effects does not exist.

6. The orientation-field method is an alternative approach that works with a small number of field variables. It is elegant and simple in its formulation but has limitations. The evolution equation of the angle field does not correctly describe the microscopic evolution of the orientation field since it does not take into account the connectivity of matter and the resulting geometrical conservation laws.

7. The dynamics of the orientation field in the orientation-field method correspond to the dynamics of matter with orientational but no positional order, such as a liquid crystal. This is not suitable for coherent crystall",0

1. The paper discusses the importance of accurate stellar parameter determination for understanding the properties of stars and galaxies. The authors highlight the limitations of traditional methods, such as the LTE-Fe method, which can lead to systematic biases in the determination of effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. They propose a new method, NLTE-Opt, which uses Balmer lines to determine effective temperatures and NLTE corrections to determine surface gravity and metallicity. This method is shown to provide more accurate results, especially for metal-poor stars.

2. The authors apply their new method to a sample of metal-poor FGK stars from the RAVE survey and compare the results to those obtained using the LTE-Fe method. They find significant systematic differences between the two methods, with the NLTE-Opt method providing more accurate results. The implications of these differences are discussed, including the impact on distance scales and abundance gradients in the Milky Way. The authors conclude that their new method provides a more reliable way to determine stellar parameters, which is essential for understanding the properties of stars and galaxies.",1

1. The study examines the effects of weak gravitational lensing on the observed magnitudes of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and finds a correlation between the magnitudes and the foreground galaxy distribution. The correlation suggests that SNe Ia are amplified by the gravitational lensing effect of foreground galaxies.

2. The analysis uses a sample of 55 SNe Ia from the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, and finds a significant anti-correlation between the SNe Ia magnitudes and the galaxy density in the foreground. The correlation is consistent with the expected signature of weak lensing.

3. The study tests the robustness of the result by varying the parameters of the analysis, such as the radius of the circles around the SNe Ia and the magnitude limit of the foreground galaxies. The result remains significant even when these parameters are changed.

4. The study uses a simple lensing model to interpret the results, which assumes that the foreground galaxies trace the mass distribution up to a certain redshift. The model has three ingredients: a probability distribution function (PDF) for the convergence, a biasing scheme, and a dispersion in the intrinsic magnitudes of SNe Ia.

5. The study finds that the slope of the magnitude-galaxy density relation depends on the amount and distribution of matter, but not on the specifics of the biasing scheme. The result is consistent with the expected signature of weak lensing and provides a new probe of the distribution of matter in the universe.",1

1. The paper discusses the physics of lanthanide-based heavy fermion (HF) metals, which exhibit distinct behavior from conventional clean metals due to strong spin-flip scattering from localized levels. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened spins. The resistivity shows a strong non-monotonic temperature dependence, and optics exhibit rich structure from the microwave to the near-infrared range. Theoretical treatments of HF center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong-coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.

2. The absence of exact results has led to the development of approximation schemes, including dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), which is formally exact in the large-dimensional limit. DMFT maps lattice models onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host. The local moment approach (LMA) is a non-perturbative method that has been developed to solve the PAM and has been shown to capture the physics of HF metals. The LMA introduces the concept of local moments and leads to a two-self-energy description, which captures the correlated spin-flip dynamics.

3. The PAM is characterized by four independent dimensionless parameters, and the system is generically metallic with non-integer f-level and conduction band occupancies. The HF regime corresponds to essentially localized f-electrons, but with arbitrary conduction band filling. The heavy fermion regime forms the main focus of the paper, and intermediate valence behavior will be discussed in a subsequent paper. The exception to this behavior arises when the f-level is at the Fermi level, resulting in a Kondo insulator.

4. Within DMFT, the self-energy becomes momentum-independent and site-diagonal, and the local Green functions are also site-independent. The LMA is used to obtain the self-energy, which is a difficult problem that requires handling non-perturbatively the full range of interaction strengths. The LMA satisfies the desiderata of handling non-perturbatively the full range of interaction strengths and respecting the asymptotic dictates of Fermi liquid behavior on the lowest energy scales.

5. The paper employs the LMA to obtain the single-particle dynamics and thermal evolution of the system. The LMA is based on an underlying two-self-energy description, which is a natural consequence of the mean-field approach. The LMA has been shown to satisfy the desiderata and is currently the only theory",0

1. The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied for several decades and has recently gained attention due to its importance in biology. DNA loop formation is a basic process that underlies genetic expression, replication, and recombination. The hairpin loop formation is an elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding. A cell is crowded with various subcellular structures, including globular proteins and RNAs, which interact with DNA.

2. Recent advances in single-molecule experiment techniques have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation. Finzi and Gelles observed Laci-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring nano-scale Brownian motion of a micron-sized particle attached to one end of the DNA. Other studies have shown that mechanical constraints such as tension and torsion play a pivotal role in DNA looping. The effects of tension on DNA looping have been studied, and it was found that small tension can increase the looping time.

3. The authors of the study performed Brownian dynamics simulation of semiflexible polymers treated as extensible wormlike chains, combined with one-dimensional theory of barrier crossing over the free energy of loop formation. They found that the looping time steeply increases with the applied tension, and the normalized looping time increases exponentially with tension. The theory of mean-field wormlike chain model provides a useful analytical model to understand the effect of tension on the looping time. The sensitivity of looping on tension is an emergent behavior that manifests beyond the complexity of real DNA loop formation.

4. The authors also studied the effect of time-dependent tension on DNA looping, considering dichotomically fluctuating tension. They found that the looping time has a resonant minimum at an optimum flipping time, which is a nontrivial extension of the resonant activation of single Brownian particle. The effect of time-dependent tension is more significant for longer chains. The results are consistent with recent experiments for both static and fluctuating tension cases, and suggest a possibility that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally utilizing the ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations.",1

The tidal interactions can lead to synchronization and orbital circularization, as well as the tidal capture or disruption of the planet. The authors consider the tidal interaction of a star and a point source, which can be a star or a planet.

2. The authors use a consistent allowance for stellar evolution to study the dynamical tides, which is a novelty of this study. They consider three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses, and calculate the overlap integrals and the change in orbital period for each star. The overlap integrals are a measure of the intensity of tidal interactions.

3. The authors use the MESA software package to model the stars and calculate the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the stellar oscillations. They solve the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction problem and calculate the overlap integrals using the Steffen method. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the differential equations.

4. The authors present the results of their calculations for the star with a mass of one solar mass, including the change in the planet's orbital period with time. They find that a planet with a mass of one Jupiter mass and an initial orbital period of 2 days or shorter will fall onto the star within several tens of millions of years. The time scale of the change in semimajor axis for this orbital period is about 100 million years.

3. The method relies on the measurement of intensity fluctuations in the speckle pattern formed by two identical and mutually incoherent point sources.
4. The authors show that the power fluctuations encode the interdistance between the sources, and changes in power fluctuations could reflect changes in the interdistance.
5. The paper introduces the concept of the cross-density of states (CDOS), which counts the number of photonic eigenmodes connecting two points at a given frequency.
6. The authors derive a relationship between the power contrast and the CDOS, which shows that the information on the interdistance between the sources is encoded in the speckle contrast measured at a single point.
7. The method does not require any explicit expression of the CDOS and relies only on the measurement of intensity fluctuations.

1. The glassy wormlike chain (GWC) model is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain (WLC) model, which describes the mechanics of semiflexible polymers. The GWC model has been successful in describing the rheological data of polymer solutions and living cells over many decades in time with a minimum of parameters. However, the model was primarily concerned with viscoelastic behavior, while recent investigations have highlighted the glassy, fragile, and inelastic character of the mechanical response of living cells. The aim of the present contribution is to extend the GWC model to situations involving inelastic deformations.

2. The GWC model is based on the idea that the polymer network can be described by an effective interaction potential, which accounts for the interactions between the polymers. The model assumes that the polymer network is characterized by a dynamic bond fraction, which depends on the strain and stress history of the network. The bond fraction determines the mechanical properties of the system, such as the storage modulus and loss angle. The model can accommodate for active biological remodeling in living cells and tissues by introducing a time-dependent force protocol.

3. The model predicts a competition between force-amplitude dependent stress-stiffening and force-rate dependent yielding events. If the backbone force stays below the yield force, the adaptation of the bond network requires an adiabatically long time, and plain viscoelastic behavior is observed. However, if the backbone tension reaches the yield force, the bond fraction declines sharply, leading to a pronounced softening. The model also predicts a non-monotonic dependence of the minimum bond fraction on the force rate, which can be understood by considering the maximum force attained during deformation and the time over which the force is applied.",1

1. The topological Mott insulator (TMI) phase has been extensively studied in two and three dimensions, but its realization in real materials has been hindered by the presence of competing orders, such as charge density waves (CDWs). The authors investigate the stability of the TMI phase in the extended Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, taking into account the effects of electron correlations and fermi velocity.

2. The authors find that the CDW phase is more stable than the TMI phase in the simplest case, but the TMI phase can be stabilized by suppressing the fermi velocity at the Dirac point, which can be achieved by introducing third-neighbor hopping. The TMI phase is also found to be more stable against fluctuations than the CDW phase.

3. The authors propose twisted bilayer graphene as a potential platform for realizing the TMI phase, where the fermi velocity can be tuned by changing the rotation angle between the two layers. They estimate that a single-particle excitation gap of up to 0.1 eV can be achieved, which is substantially larger than room temperature.",1

The article discusses the discovery of topological gapless edge states in gated multi-layer graphene systems, which are protected by time reversal, no-valley-mixing, and electron number conservation symmetries. These edge states are found to exist at the tilt boundaries between AB and BA stacked domains. The authors propose that these edge states can be used to explain the long-standing mystery of sub-gap transport in gated bilayer graphene.

2. The authors use a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations to demonstrate the existence of gapless edge states at the tilt boundaries. They find that the edge states are robust against strain and width variations of the tilt boundary. The calculations also show that the edge states are valley-filtered, meaning that they can be used to separate electrons with different valley indices.

3. The authors use the framework of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to classify the topological insulator phase supporting the edge states. They find that the phase is a quantum valley Hall (QVH) insulator, which is distinct from previously proposed topological phases such as quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators.

4. The authors discuss the consequences of symmetry changes on the topological phase, including the possibility of transitioning to a layer antiferromagnetic (LAF) phase. They find that the LAF phase is a topological insulator with an odd number of edge modes for each valley, unlike previously proposed QAH and QSH phases.

5. The authors propose several experimental tests to confirm their predictions, including four-terminal transport measurements, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, thermoelectric imaging, and scanning SQUID experiments. These experiments can be used to detect the gapless edge states and confirm their topological origin.

1. Macromolecules with ionizable groups, such as polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes, can dissolve in polar solvents like water and dissociate into charged macromolecules and counterions. These macromolecules are often water-soluble and have various industrial and medical applications. Many biological macromolecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins, are charged polymers. The study of charged polymers has been an important area of research in polymer science.

2. Polyelectrolytes contain a single sign of charged monomers, while polyampholytes have charged monomers of both signs. In a polyampholyte chain, attractive interactions between oppositely charged monomers decrease the chain size, whereas in a polyelectrolyte chain, repulsive interactions swell the chain. The sequence of charged monomers on the chains affects the behavior of polyampholytes in solution. This sequence can influence the aggregation behavior and self-assembly process of ionically complementary peptides.

3. Brushes formed by grafted polymers on a surface are of great interest in industrial and biological applications and academic research. With a sufficiently strong repulsion between the polymers, the chains become stretched, forming a polymer brush. The anchored polymers of a brush may be composed of charged monomers, resulting in a polyelectrolyte or polyampholyte brush. Electrostatic interactions introduce additional length scales to the system, such as the Bjerrum length and Debye screening length.

4. In a polyelectrolyte brush, the repulsion of electrostatic origin between the chains can be strong even at low grafting densities, making it easy to access the brush regime. Polyelectrolyte brushes have been extensively investigated using theoretical and computer simulation methods. At high enough grafting densities and charge fractions, most counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush, and the competition between osmotic pressure and elasticity determines the brush thickness.

5. The brush thickness of a polyelectrolyte brush can be described by theoretical scaling methods, which predict no dependence on the grafting density. However, other scaling methods that account for excluded volume effects and nonlinear elasticity predict a linear dependence on the grafting density. The diffusion of a fraction of counterions outside the brush leads to a logarithmic dependence of the average brush thickness on the grafting density.

The numerous candidates cannot be accommodated in one nonet, and some are supposed to be glueballs, molecular states, and tetraquark states. The article constructs color singlet tetraquark currents with scalar diquark fields and performs the standard procedure of the QCD sum rules to study the nonet scalar mesons below 1.2 GeV.

The paper presents three numerical examples to demonstrate the feasibility of the PTC method, including a 145-bus system where the PTC method provided correct approximations and was 7 times faster than the trapezoidal method, and a 14-bus system where the PTC method captured instabilities of the long-term stability model. The results show that the PTC method can successfully provide correct stability assessment and overcome numerical difficulties in power system long-term stability analysis.",1

1. The problem of anisotropic quantum scattering in two-dimensional (2D) systems has gained significant attention in recent years, driven by proposals for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. This interest is also fueled by the experimental production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps, which has opened up ways to realize these phenomena. The study of 2D quantum effects has a long history in condensed matter physics, with examples including superfluid films, high-temperature superconductivity, and 2D materials like graphene. The development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2D Bose and Fermi ultracold gases has provided opportunities for modeling these 2D effects in a highly controlled environment.

2. The theory of elementary quantum two-body systems and processes in the plane has been stimulated by the interest in 2D geometry, with special consideration given to the anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction. The usual partial-wave analysis becomes inefficient for describing dipole-dipole scattering due to the strong anisotropic coupling of different partial waves in the asymptotic region. Considerable progress has been made in the analysis of 2D and quasi-2D scattering of dipoles, including the study of 2D dipolar scattering in the threshold and semiclassical regimes. The method developed in this work permits the description of 2D collisions of unpolarized dipoles.

3. The method is based on the approach suggested for few-dimensional scattering problems and applied to dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in 3D free space. The key elements of the method are described in Section II, and it is applied to 2D scattering on a cylindrical potential with an elliptical base and 2D dipole-dipole scattering of unpolarized dipoles. The method reproduces the threshold formula for the scattering amplitude on a cylinder potential with a circular base and the results for 2D scattering of polarized dipoles. The high efficiency of the method has been found in all problems considered.

4. The 2D Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is used to describe the quantum scattering on an anisotropic potential in the plane. The interaction potential can be anisotropic in the general case, and the task is to solve the problem with the interaction potential for all possible orientations of the scatterer and fixed energy. The scattering amplitude is found by solving the boundary-value problem, and",0

1. The supernova remnant G65.2+5.7 was identified a decade ago, but it was ignored after initial observations. Now, it has become interesting again due to its thermal composite morphology. This morphology is characterized by a shell-like radio continuum and a centrally bright X-ray morphology. The X-ray emission is thermal, rather than synchrotron, in nature.

2. Thermal composite supernova remnants are mysterious and have been suggested to lack X-ray shells due to evolution into the radiative phase or thermal conduction. Other possibilities include ejecta enrichment, dust destruction, or collisions with molecular clouds. The origins of these remnants are still unclear. G65.2+5.7 is a good example of a thermal composite remnant.

3. Previous observations of G65.2+5.7 have shown that it has a shell-like radio continuum morphology and emits thermal X-rays. The remnant is sufficiently evolved, with a weak shock and cool, recombined gas behind it. The size and distance of the remnant have been estimated using various techniques. The remnant lies 90 pc above the galactic disk and is estimated to be around 23,000 years old.

4. Archival ROSAT data were used to map the remnant, confirming that the emitting gas is extended and fills the remnant's outline. The X-ray emission is centrally filled, with a slowly decreasing temperature gradient. The gas is near collisional ionizational equilibrium, and the electron temperature ranges from 2.5 to 3.4 keV. The column densities ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 x 10^22 cm^-2.

5. The remnant's luminosity is estimated to be around 1.4 x 10^36 ergs s^-1, and the electron density of the X-ray emitting gas is around 0.04 cm^-3. The ambient density is expected to be around 0.1 cm^-3, a reasonable value at the remnant's location. The remnant's thermal composite morphology and radiative phase evolution are supported by the observations. Further studies are needed to understand the origins of thermal composite supernova remnants.",1

The authors present a new encoding scheme that supports fast computation of the permutation and its inverse. The scheme is based on the concept of runs in permutations.

2. The authors introduce the concept of runs in permutations, which are maximal ranges of consecutive positions that do not contain any down-steps. They show that the number of runs in a permutation is a measure of its disorder. The authors also introduce the concept of strict runs, which are runs with additional properties.

3. The authors present an encoding scheme that uses at most n log n bits to encode a permutation with k runs, and supports the computation of the permutation and its inverse in O(log n) time. The scheme is based on the Hu-Tucker algorithm and wavelet trees. The authors also show that the scheme can be simplified when the distribution of runs is not particularly favorable.

4. The authors discuss the application of their encoding scheme to sorting algorithms. They show that their scheme can be used to sort an array of length n covered by k runs in O(n log k) time, which is worst-case optimal in the comparison model. The authors also discuss the application of their scheme to other data structures, such as succinct encodings of sequences.

5. The authors introduce the concept of shuffled upsequences, which are a more sophisticated concept than runs.

1. The paper investigates the phenomenon of chimera states in networks of Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators, which are a type of neuron model, and finds that chimera states can occur in both 2D and 3D versions of the model.
2. The study shows that chimera states can arise in the 2D model when the membrane potential variables are coupled, and in the 3D model when the coupling is restricted to the membrane potential variable, leading to a rich variety of bifurcation scenarios.
3. The authors also identify a novel type of mixed oscillatory state (MOS) where desynchronized neurons are interspersed among those that are either stationary or oscillate in synchrony, which is related to the bistability of the Hindmarsh-Rose model.

1. The Kauffman model is a disordered dynamical system that was proposed to model genetic regulatory systems. It consists of a set of binary variables, each representing the state of a gene, and a set of response functions that determine the next state of each variable based on the current states of its control variables. The model exhibits a phase transition between a frozen phase, where the system converges to a fixed point, and a chaotic phase, where the system exhibits complex behavior. The phase transition is characterized by a critical line in the parameter space, where the system exhibits scale-invariant behavior.

2. The authors study the properties of the Kauffman model using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. They introduce the concept of ""relevant elements,"" which are elements that influence the long-time behavior of the system, and show that the number of relevant elements scales with the system size in the frozen phase and on the critical line. They also study the distribution of the magnetization, which is a measure of the activity of each element, and find that it exhibits finite-size effects that can be explained by the periodic dynamics of the system. The authors' results provide new insights into the behavior of the Kauffman model and its applications to biological systems.",1

1. The study investigates spin-superflow turbulence (SST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature, finding that both the -5/3 and -1 power laws appear in the spectrum of the superflow kinetic and spin-dependent interaction energy. The Kolmogorov spectrum in SST is generated by the nonlinear spin term, which is different from the mechanism in classical turbulence.

2. The numerical results of the spin-1 spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation show that SST in a two-dimensional system can be obtained by the counterflow instability, and both the -5/3 and -1 power laws appear. The inertial term and the nonlinear spin term of the velocity motion equation are estimated in the wave number space, confirming that the Kolmogorov spectrum in SST is generated by the nonlinear spin term.

3. The study discusses the dependence of the spectra of the superflow kinetic and spin-dependent interaction energy on the relative velocity, finding that the period sustaining the Kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy becomes short when the relative velocity is large. The -1 power law in the spectrum of spin-dependent interaction energy can appear even under the condition of large relative velocity.

4. The possibility of inverse cascade in SST is discussed, and the study finds that the inverse energy cascade for superflow kinetic energy does not occur in the two-dimensional SST because the enstrophy in ferromagnetic spin-1 spinor BEC is not conserved. The direction of energy cascade for the spin-dependent interaction energy is not fully understood and requires further study.",1

1. The study focuses on low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) that reside in about 40% of nearby bright galaxies, and occupy the majority of the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). LLAGNs are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto super-massive black holes.

2. The advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of LLAGNs, which is not seen in luminous AGNs like quasars. The ADAF model also predicts a high brightness temperature in radio bands, making it promising for future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments.

3. The study reports millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for 20 VLBI-detected LLAGNs, with the goal of detecting the inverted spectrum of the ADAF. The high-frequency observation is less affected by non-thermal jets and can detect larger flux densities at higher frequencies.

4. The sample selection includes 20 out of 25 all-known LLAGN radio sources that have been detected with VLBI, with the remaining five sources not included due to recent detection and lack of published reports. The sample is considered moderately good distance-limited and radio-flux-limited for LLAGNs with compact radio cores.

5. The millimetre continuum observations were made using the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, with a centre frequency of 95.725 GHz and a half-power beam width of 7 arcsec. The data were reduced using the UVPROC-II package and imaged using the AIPS software.

6. The study finds that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, and submillimetre fluxes measured with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) may be from dust associated with host galaxies. The SCUBA data were useful for estimating dust contamination in the NMA measurements.

7. The study confirms little diffuse contamination in the NMA measurements from dust, free-free, and extended non-thermal emissions for LLAGNs showing inverted spectra. Therefore, the inverted spectra are not caused by resolution effects, but intrinsic properties of the cores.

1. The study focuses on measuring the slope of the extinction law, @xmath0, in the direction of differentially reddened globular clusters, using three methods: @xmath25 rms, @xmath25 slope, and optical/IR. The methods rely on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch (HB) will be minimized when the appropriate @xmath0 value is used to correct for extinction and reddening.

2. The @xmath25 rms method uses three-color photometry of differentially reddened globular clusters, where the relative visual extinction of each star is calculated based on a fiducial HB curve. The method reproduces the correct @xmath0 to within @xmath82 for photometric errors of 10%, but the scatter in output @xmath0 increases to @xmath83 for 50% errors.

3. The @xmath25 slope method is similar to the @xmath25 rms method, but instead of computing the difference between two @xmath3 values, one is plotted against the other and a linear fit is made. The slope of the linear fit approaches unity when the test @xmath0 approaches the true input @xmath0 value.

4. The optical/IR method relies on two-color photometry and the SFD reddening map, where @xmath25 values are derived for all HB stars by scaling the corresponding SFD @xmath43 values. This method is particularly well-suited to wide-field data.

5. The study uses simulated cluster data sets to test the @xmath0 measurement methods, with three input @xmath0 values and three levels of photometric precision. The simulations are designed to mimic the general properties of the NGC 4833 data set as closely as possible.

6. The results of the @xmath25 rms and @xmath25 slope methods are summarized in a table, showing the scatter in output @xmath0 for different input @xmath0 values and photometric errors. The methods are found to be less powerful for larger photometric errors.

7. The study applies the three methods to the NGC 4833 data set, with the @xmath25 rms method giving @xmath92, the @xmath25 slope method giving @xmath96, and the optical/IR method not reported. The results are used to estimate the @xmath0 value towards NGC 4833.",1

1. The Kondo lattice model (KLM) is a theoretical framework used to study heavy-fermion systems, which are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, including the Kondo scale, bandwidth, and superexchange. The KLM describes an array of localized magnetic moments coupled to a metallic host of conduction electrons.

2. The dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) is a numerical method used to solve the KLM, which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the Kondo effect, but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size. The DCA is well-suited for studying the competition between Kondo screening and the RKKY interaction.

3. The single-particle spectral function is a key quantity of interest in the KLM, which can be calculated using the DCA. The spectral function exhibits a hybridization gap, indicating Kondo screening, and shadow bands, which arise from the scattering of heavy quasiparticles off magnetic fluctuations. The topology of the Fermi surface changes across the magnetic phase transition.

4. The mean-field model provides a scenario for the topological transition of the Fermi surface within the ordered phase, which corresponds to two Lifshitz transitions. The mean-field calculation can account for the observed spectral function features, including the heavy-fermion band in the ordered phase, and the absence of Kondo breakdown within the model calculations.",0

1. The discovery of the Higgs particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has led to a major step towards understanding the origin of mass in fundamental particles. The Higgs field is expected to couple to spacetime curvature, which could affect the mass of particles in strong-gravity environments. This coupling could be tested by observing the spectra of white dwarfs, which have strong gravitational fields.

2. The Higgs field is expected to couple to the Ricci scalar, but this is zero outside spherically symmetric masses, so the Kretschmann invariant is used instead. The coupling constant between the Higgs field and the Kretschmann invariant is a free parameter that needs to be extracted from phenomenological analyses. The mass shift due to the Higgs-Kretschmann coupling is proportional to the electron mass.

3. The authors observed the carbon-rich white dwarf BPM 27606 using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and detected the C2 Swan bands, which are sensitive to the electron mass. They measured the wavelengths of the bandheads and compared them to laboratory measurements, finding no significant shifts. The pressure shifts in the Swan bands were estimated using laboratory measurements and atmospheric models.

4. The authors also observed the white dwarf Procyon B using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and detected the C2 Swan bands, as well as MgII and CaII lines. They measured the wavelengths of these features and corrected for pressure shifts and orbital motion. The results were consistent with the results for BPM 27606.

5. The absence of relative shifts between the electronic and vibrational transitions of the Swan bands allows for an upper bound to be placed on the Higgs-Kretschmann coupling. The bound is expressed in terms of the Planck length, which is a fundamental unit of length in quantum gravity. The bound is comparable to bounds from LHC experiments.

6. The methodology used in this study is complementary to bounds from LHC experiments and can be used to search for couplings between generic scalar fields and spacetime curvature. The bounds could be even more stringent if compact astrophysical sources with non-zero Ricci scalar are found.

7. The spectroscopic analysis presented in this study could be improved by measuring and calculating pressure shifts of CI lines and Swan bands under white dwarf conditions. Observations of ultraviolet carbon and metal lines would also help disentangle pressure shifts from gravitational redshift measurements.

The paper discusses the importance of accurately modeling the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxy evolution simulations, particularly the formation of molecular gas, which is crucial for star formation. The authors focus on the role of radiative shielding in regulating the chemical state of the ISM, specifically the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). They use a combination of numerical simulations and analytical models to study the effects of radiative shielding on the formation of molecular gas.

1. The study examines the relationship between star formation and galaxy density in low-redshift galaxy clusters. It uses data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to detect dusty, star-forming galaxies in 69 clusters. The sample is limited to galaxies with star formation rates (SFRs) above 4.6 M yr^-1, which corresponds to a total infrared luminosity of 10^11 L. The study finds that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing galaxy density.

2. The study also investigates the radial dependence of star formation in clusters. It finds that the mean specific SFR (mSSFR) increases with projected radius, with the most central bin containing the fewest star-forming galaxies. The mSSFR displays a steep increase from the central bin to 1.5R_200, then continues to increase monotonically and nearly flattens out below the field value at larger radii. This is consistent with a low-redshift study of Hα star-forming galaxies.

3. The study examines the relation between cluster mass and total current cluster star formation. It finds no significant correlation between cluster specific SFR (CSSFR) and cluster mass, over more than one order of magnitude in M_200. This lack of correlation is confirmed with a subsample of 22 low-z clusters, for which the study is sensitive to star-forming galaxies down to SFR=1.4 M yr^-1. The results suggest that mechanisms that scale strongly with cluster mass may not play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in clusters.

4. The study's findings imply that star formation is quenched in a significant population of galaxies within small groups or filaments, and that a mechanism that is not strongly dependent on cluster mass must operate. Strangulation, which removes hot halo gas and cuts off future cold gas supplies, is suggested as a plausible candidate for quenching star formation in cluster star-forming galaxies. This mechanism is less dependent on cluster mass than ram pressure or harassment, and simulations have shown that it can occur in low-mass groups. The study's results are consistent with previous studies that have suggested strangulation as an important cluster mechanism.",0

1. The strong Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property (SBPBp) is a property of pairs of Banach spaces, which is a stronger version of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property. The SBPBp is defined as a pair of Banach spaces having a certain property related to norm-attaining operators. The property is defined in terms of the existence of a positive real number that depends on a given operator and a fixed number. The SBPBp is a natural extension of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property to the context of bounded linear operators.

2. The uniform SBPBp is a stronger version of the SBPBp, where the positive real number depends only on the fixed number. It is shown that if a pair of Banach spaces has the uniform SBPBp, then the domain space must be uniformly convex. However, it is also shown that there are pairs of Banach spaces that fail the uniform SBPBp, even when the domain space is a Hilbert space. The failure of the uniform SBPBp is demonstrated through the construction of a bounded linear operator that attains its norm at a certain point.

3. The paper also studies the SBPBp and uniform SBPBp for specific pairs of Banach spaces. It is shown that the pair of spaces L1 and L∞ fails the uniform SBPBp, and that the pair of spaces ℓ1 and ℓ∞ also fails the uniform SBPBp. Additionally, it is shown that if a Banach space has a finite-dimensional subspace, then the pair of spaces fails the uniform SBPBp. The failure of the uniform SBPBp is demonstrated through the construction of a bounded linear operator that attains its norm at a certain point.

4. The paper concludes by noting that the negative results obtained for the uniform SBPBp can be used to construct examples of pairs of Banach spaces that fail the SBPBp. It is also noted that if a Banach space contains a strictly convex finite-dimensional subspace, then there exists a uniformly convex Banach space such that the pair of spaces fails the uniform SBPBp. The paper provides a comprehensive study of the SBPBp and uniform SBPBp, and provides new insights into the properties of Banach spaces.",0

1. The frozen nucleon approximation is a method for fast and precise calculation of inclusive 2p-2h response functions in a relativistic Fermi gas model. This approach neglects the momentum dependence of the two holes in the ground state and requires the use of an effective propagator for the Δ resonance conveniently averaged over the Fermi sphere. The approximation makes it possible to compute the responses with only a one-dimensional integral, which can be of great interest when implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo event generators. The frozen approach is valid for momentum transfers above the Fermi momentum and can be used instead of the full 7d integral, obtaining very satisfactory results.

2. The validity of the frozen approximation is supported by the comparison between the shell model and the relativistic Fermi gas model, which shows that the detailed information about the momenta carried out by the two nucleons is lost in the inclusive responses for two-particle emission. The energy and momentum transfer are shared by the two nucleons in multiple ways, making the elementary response soft and dependent on the initial momenta. The low-energy region where the sharing is highly restricted and the cross section is very small is found to be sensitive to the details of the initial state. The frozen approximation can be extended to explore how the 2p-2h MEC responses depend on nuclear species in the near future.",1

The campaign lasted for about a month and obtained 22 nights of spectra with a mean sampling time of about 1.6 days. The observed frame time lag between the changes in the Hβ emission line flux and the changes in the continuum flux at 5100 Å was found to be about 3.14 days. After correcting for the redshift, the corresponding time lag in the rest frame of the source was found to be about 2.35 days.

2. The measured time lag was used to estimate the size of the broad-line region (BLR) and the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the galaxy. The estimated BLR size was found to be about 67 light-days, and the SMBH mass was estimated to be about 1.4 × 10^6 M. The results are in agreement with the known R-L relationship, and the estimated SMBH mass is consistent with the expected value based on the galaxy's bulge velocity dispersion.

1. The broad emission iron lines are a well-known feature found in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, originating close to the black hole through the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc. The spin of the black hole plays a crucial role in shaping the line, particularly in determining the position of the marginally stable orbit.

2. The Laor model has been widely used to model the relativistic disc spectral line, assuming a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, but it has limitations, such as not allowing the spin to be fitted. The Ky model, on the other hand, relaxes this limitation and allows the spin to be fitted, providing a more flexible and accurate model.

3. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin by identifying the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit, but it has limitations, such as a less accurate grid and insufficient energy resolution. The Ky model, with its more flexible and accurate approach, provides a better fit to the data and more reliable constraints on the spin.

4. The authors used the XMM-Newton satellite data to study the iron line band in two representative sources, MCG-6-30-15 (an active galaxy) and GX 339-4 (an X-ray binary). The iron line is better constrained in MCG-6-30-15 due to its longer exposure time and higher count rate.

5. The authors compared the Laor and Ky models in fitting the broad iron line and found that the Ky model provides a better fit and more reliable constraints on the spin. The Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, affecting the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.

6. The authors emphasize the importance of correct rebinning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution to obtain statistically relevant results and highlight the potential of the Ky model in constraining black hole spin using high-quality data from future missions like XEUS.",0

These solutions can be static or stationary and with or without radial pressure. The ""displace, cut, and reflect"" method is used to generate disks from known solutions of Einstein's equations. This method can produce disks with radial pressure, which is a more realistic model of galaxies.

2. The article applies the ""displace, cut, and reflect"" method to the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates to generate a disk with radial pressure. The resulting disk has a surface energy density, radial and azimuthal pressures, and a sound velocity that decrease monotonically with the radius of the disk. The disk's tangential velocity is calculated, and the stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is analyzed. The results show that the disk is stable for certain ranges of parameters.

The article also applies the ""displace, cut, and reflect"" method to exact solutions of Einstein's equations for static spheres of perfect fluid, such as the Buchdahl solution and the Narlikar-Patwardhan-Vaidya (NPV) solutions.

The physical properties of the disks and halos are analyzed, including the energy density, pressure, sound velocity, and tangential velocity. The stability of circular orbits on the disk's plane is also analyzed.

4. The existence of a domain wall of relative phase in binary BEC with a coupling drive can be shown by considering fluctuations of the fields on length scales much larger than the healing lengths.
5. The domain wall solution is similar to the kink in the sine-Gordon field theory, but it is not topologically stable and can decay.
6. The decay of the wall occurs via hole nucleation, and the rate of decay is exponentially suppressed unless the Rabi frequency is very close to the critical value.
7. The domain wall can be bounded by a vortex line, and the energy of a single vortex per unit length increases linearly with the size of the system in the transverse direction.
8. The phenomenon of ""vortex confinement"" occurs, where vortices exist only in pairs, similar to quark confinement in quantum chromodynamics.
9. The authors estimate that the critical value of the Rabi frequency for the existence of the domain wall is of the order of 100 Hz, which is not too small for experimental realization.

1. An anomaly in field theory occurs when a symmetry of the action or conservation law is violated in the quantized version, which was discovered by Adler, Bell, and Jackiw, and Bardeen in 1969.
2. The breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous for the theory, but the breakdown of an internal symmetry leads to an inconsistency of the quantum theory.
3. The anomalies can be calculated using the method of dispersion relations, which is an independent and complementary view of the anomaly phenomenon compared to the ultraviolet regularization procedures.
4. The dispersion relations relate the real part of the amplitude to its imaginary part, which can be easily calculated via Cutkosky's rule.
5. The formfactors of the amplitude can be expressed by dispersion relations, and the imaginary parts of the formfactors satisfy the Ward identities.
6. The method of dispersion relations can reproduce the results of a definite regularization scheme, namely the n-dimensional regularization procedure of 't Hooft and Veltman.
7. The formfactors of the amplitude can be determined explicitly in the n-dimensional regularization procedure, and they agree with the results obtained using the dispersion relation approach.
8. In the massless limit, the formfactors satisfy the Ward identities, and the amplitudes depend only on the convergent formfactor.
9. The results obtained using the dispersion relation approach and the n-dimensional regularization procedure lead to the same amplitudes and consequently to the same anomaly expression.",1

1. The study simulates the propagation of a high-frequency electromagnetic wave into the ionosphere, using a one-dimensional model that neglects certain effects such as the EM field falloff and the influence of field-aligned irregularities. The simulation uses a vertically stratified ion number density profile and a constant geomagnetic field directed obliquely to the density gradient. The EM wave is injected vertically into the ionosphere with spatial variations only in the z-direction.

2. The simulation shows that the EM pulse propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer, where it undergoes Faraday rotation due to the different dispersion properties of the L-O and R-X modes. The L-O mode pulse is concentrated into a single half-wave envelope at 220 km, while the turning point of the less localized R-X mode is at 240 km. The maximum amplitude of the R-X mode is 0.5 V/m, while that of the L-O mode is 1.2 V/m.

3. At 2.4 ms, the L-O and R-X mode wave packets have widened in space, and the EM wave has started turning back towards lower altitudes. The L-O mode oscillations at 220 km are radiating EM waves with significant magnetic field components. The leading part of the pulse is primarily R-X mode polarized, while its trailing part is L-O mode polarized.

4. The simulation also shows the production of electrostatic waves with a wavelength of approximately 33 m and a frequency of 5 MHz, which are observed at an altitude of 220 km. These waves are interpreted as electrostatic Langmuir/upper hybrid waves produced by mode conversion of the L-O mode. The amplitudes of the E_y and E_x components are much weaker than that of the E_z component for these oscillations.

5. The frequency spectrum of the electric field component E_z at an altitude of 220 km and of E_y at an altitude of 240 km shows the large-amplitude pump wave at 5 MHz and the relatively weak second harmonics of the pump wave at 10 MHz. The spectrum also shows low-frequency oscillations due to the nonlinear down-shifting/mixing of the high-frequency wave field. The nonlinear effects at the turning point of the L-O and R-X modes are investigated in the simulation.

1. The article discusses the Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice, which has been used to describe superfluid Mott-insulator transitions in various systems. The authors use perturbation theory to improve the mean-field solution of the model, incorporating short-range correlations between lattice sites. They calculate corrections to local quantities, such as particle number fluctuations, and observable expansion patterns. The perturbative approach is expected to be more accurate than the mean-field solution, especially near the phase transition.

2. The authors numerically calculate the corrections to the mean-field result using perturbation theory up to second order, including correlations between next and next-nearest lattice sites. They find good agreement between the perturbative results and exact diagonalization results for small one-dimensional lattices. The perturbative corrections to the particle number fluctuations show a smooth transition at the Mott-insulator-superfluid transition. The corrections to the correlation function and expansion patterns are also discussed.

3. The inclusion of short-range correlations leads to distinct modifications of the expansion patterns, such as broad peaks in the Mott-insulator regime and suppression of the superfluid peak in the superfluid regime. The authors also study the effects of a harmonic confinement potential, which leads to coexisting superfluid and Mott-insulator regions. They find modifications of up to 20% of the peak maximum in the expansion patterns. The perturbative corrections become more complex in the presence of a harmonic trap.

4. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the perturbative approach, including the calculation of the corrections to the density matrix. They use a diagrammatic representation to illustrate the matrix elements, which helps to visualize the perturbative corrections. The first-order correction to the density matrix is discussed in detail, and the authors show how the perturbative approach can be used to calculate corrections to other observables. The article concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the perturbative approach and the need for further improvements.",1

1. The paper discusses cosmological models with scalar field matter, which have been studied in the context of inflation and late-time acceleration. The authors analyze the equations of motion for multi-scalar cosmologies and find that fixed points occur only for exponential potentials. They determine the nature of these fixed points for arbitrary spacetime dimension, curvature, and sign of the potential. The results are in complete analogy with those of the one-scalar case.

2. The authors develop a method to describe the generic evolution of multi-scalar cosmologies by viewing them as geodesic motion in an augmented target space. They show that cosmological trajectories for flat spacetime are null geodesics in the doubly-augmented target space, while for non-flat spacetime, they are geodesics with respect to a conformally rescaled metric. The method allows for a simple visualization of acceleration and deceleration in these models. The authors also discuss the implications of their results for the phenomenon of transient acceleration in cosmology.",1

1. The authors conducted a search for wide, common proper motion companions to nearby Hipparcos stars and discovered a faint, red star, LSPM J2322+7847, near the active and rapidly rotating G9V star HIP 115147. This star was previously identified as LP 12-90 by Luyten in 1967. The authors obtained new photometry and trigonometric parallax astrometry for LSPM J2322+7847. The star's estimated distance is approximately 52 pc.

2. HIP 115147 is a young, naked ""post-T Tauri"" dwarf with a high degree of chromospheric and coronal activity, and is one of the most powerful X-ray emitters in the solar neighborhood. The star's X-ray luminosity is typical of weak-lined T Tauri stars in Taurus-Auriga-Perseus, but significantly larger than that of classical T Tauri stars. The star's age is estimated to be less than 20 Myr based on its high degree of chromospheric and extreme ultraviolet activity. The star's rotation period is 2.74 days.

3. The authors obtained photometric data for HIP 115147, its known visual companion HIP 115147B, and LSPM J2322+7847, and plotted HR diagrams in the 2MASS J, H, and Ks passbands. The data suggest that the stars are co-moving and have a similar age. The authors used theoretical isochrones to estimate the age of the stars, and found that the 50 Myr isochrone provides the best fit. The estimated mass of LSPM J2322+7847 is approximately 0.12 Msun.

4. The authors compared the stars to other young stars in the solar neighborhood, including the extremely active dwarf PZ Tel, which is a likely member of the β Pictoris association. PZ Tel is significantly brighter than HIP 115147 in the Ks band, suggesting that HIP 115147 and its companions are older than 16 Myr. The authors also compared the stars to members of the very young TW association, which are certainly much younger than HIP 115147 and its companions.

3. The acceleron's potential and the neutrino mass evolve with the universe, depending on the scalar potential and the relation between the acceleron and neutrino mass.
4. The authors present a supersymmetric Mavans model, including the effect of supersymmetry breaking mediated by gravity, and calculate the evolution of the neutrino mass and equation of state parameter.
5. The model assumes a chiral superfield in the dark sector, whose scalar component causes cosmic acceleration, and a right-handed neutrino superfield, with supersymmetry broken in the hidden sector at TeV scale.
6. The authors consider two cases: one with vanishing mixing between left-handed and sterile neutrinos, and one with finite mixing, and find that both cases can avoid instability and act as dark energy.
7. In the vanishing mixing case, only the sterile neutrino mass varies on cosmological time scale, while in the finite mixing case, both left-handed and sterile neutrino masses vary, but the variation is extremely small.

1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons are deconfined, and it is being studied extensively in theoretical and experimental research. The QGP phase transition structure is one of the central aims of research in hot and dense QCD. The study of hot and dense nuclear matter in the form of QGP has been ongoing for about thirty years. Experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have been trying to create QGP.

2. The formation of QGP was tentatively confirmed by the results obtained at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in 2005. The consensus of the four research groups was in favor of the creation of a quark-gluon liquid at very low viscosity. In this new phase of matter, quarks and gluons interact weakly, and perturbative methods can be used. The asymptotic freedom suggests two procedures for the creation of QGP: at high temperature and at high baryon density.

3. The Landau Fermi liquid theory is used to describe the relativistic systems such as nuclear matter under extreme conditions, quark matter, and quark-gluon plasma. The energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP can be evaluated using the Landau-Fermi interaction function. The total energy of interacting quarks can be calculated using the equations derived from the Landau-Fermi liquid model. The thermodynamic quantities of the interacting QGP, such as the internal energy, pressure, and entropy, can be calculated from the partition function.

4. The phase diagram of QGP can be extracted by solving the equation that equates the QGP pressure and the hadronic pressure. The results show that the one-gluon exchange interaction facilitates the quarks' transition to the deconfined phase at lower density. The increase in the interaction strength and the QCD coupling constant makes the pressure rise, and the formation of QGP happens much easier for the interacting quarks than the noninteracting one. The phase diagram can be improved by considering the hadronic pressure and the bag pressure.",1

1. The concept of stochastic resonance was introduced in the early 1980s in the study of periodic advances of glaciers on Earth, and it refers to the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by adding noise. The problem is to estimate a signal transmitted through a channel, and the addition of noise can make the signal observable and allow for inference.

2. The optimal level of noise that maximizes the Fisher information quantity is called stochastic resonance, and it can be measured using criteria such as the Shannon mutual information or the Kullback divergence. The Fisher information quantity can be maximized for certain noise structures, and if there is only one global maximum, the corresponding noise level is the value for which we have stochastic resonance.

3. The paper studies the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model where a threshold and a subthreshold constant signal are added with a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process. The observable part of the trajectory is the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold or the energy of the signal when it is above the threshold.

4. Two schemes of observations are proposed, and two different estimators are studied for each scheme, with their asymptotic properties established. The results show that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators, and the phenomenon of stochastic resonance appears pronounced in the example considered.

5. The paper also studies the problem of testing two simple hypotheses for the model, using the maximum a posteriori probability criterion. The decision rules for the model are similar to those proposed by Chapeau-Blondeau in the i.i.d. setting, and the overall probability of error is non-monotonically dependent on the noise level.

6. The use of ergodic diffusions as noise in the problem of stochastic resonance seems powerful, and characterizations of classes of ergodic processes that enhance stochastic resonance can be done. The problem of a parametric non-constant signal can also be treated, while the full non-parametric non-constant signal requires further investigation.

7. The analysis of the overall probability of error seems to put in evidence something new with respect to the current literature, and it is worth noting that in a recent paper, models driven by ergodic diffusions have also been used, but the effect of stochastic resonance is not used to estimate parameters.",0

1. The paper investigates the order parameter in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) and its pairing symmetry. The authors focus on the thermal transport properties of YBaCuO (YBCO) single crystals in the presence of a magnetic field. They measure the longitudinal thermal conductivity and observe a fourfold oscillation at low temperatures, which can be explained by the Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and the Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of quasiparticles. The results confirm the predominance of the d-wave pairing symmetry up to temperatures close to the critical temperature.

2. The authors use a two-dimensional model of the Boltzmann transport equation to analyze the thermal conductivity data. They take into account the Andreev scattering rate, impurity scattering rate, and inelastic scattering rate. The model reproduces the symmetry of the curves in the whole measured temperature range, supporting the d-wave pairing symmetry. The results also confirm the idea of a competition between the thermal activation of quasiparticles in the direction of the thermal current and the gap structure.

3. The paper compares the experimental results with theoretical models and finds that the d-wave gap symmetry is the only gap function that can explain the whole angular patterns up to temperatures close to the critical temperature. The anisotropy of the s-wave gap proposed for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO) does not seem to occur in YBCO. The authors also discuss the temperature dependence of the inelastic scattering rate, which is related to the quasiparticle-quasiparticle scattering mechanism.

4. The study concludes that the mechanisms that influence the behavior of quasiparticles below the critical temperature and above 20 K are well described by the Fermi liquid theory at nearly optimal doping. The small differences found in the angle patterns between the twinned and untwinned samples can be explained in terms of the different impurity concentration and oxygen deficiency. The results provide new insights into the thermal transport properties of HTS and the pairing symmetry of the order parameter. The study demonstrates the importance of considering both Andreev scattering and Doppler shift in the energy spectrum of quasiparticles to understand the thermal conductivity of HTS.",0

The paper discusses Dehn surgery, a operation that modifies a three-manifold by drilling and regluing a solid torus, and the concept of purely cosmetic surgeries, which are two surgeries along the same knot with distinct slopes that result in the same manifold. The authors study purely cosmetic surgeries along knots in the three-sphere.

2. The authors conjecture that two surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic, known as the Cosmetic Surgery Conjecture, and prove that for most knots, two surgeries with distinct slopes result in different manifolds. They provide a sufficient condition for a knot to admit no purely cosmetic surgery in terms of its Jones polynomial.

3. The authors use a surgery formula by Lescop, which involves a knot invariant that satisfies a crossing change formula, to prove their main result. They also show that this invariant is equal to a finite type invariant of order three, which enables them to reformulate their theorem in terms of finite type invariants.

They also derive an explicit formula for the finite type invariant of order three for two-bridge knots.

5. The authors review background and properties of the Jones polynomial and prove crossing change formulae for derivatives of the Jones polynomial. They also relate the finite type invariant to the derivatives of the Jones polynomial.

They review the construction of the Kontsevich-Kuperberg-Thurston invariant and its connection to perturbative and quantum invariants of three-manifolds.

1. The paper discusses the Hypercharged Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (HCAMSb) model, which is a variant of the Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB) model. HCAMSb models have attractive properties, such as calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms and real and flavor-invariant soft terms. However, they also have a problem with negative slepton mass-squared parameters.

2. To solve this problem, a universal mass term is added to the AMSB soft supersymmetry breaking terms, which renders them positive. The parameter space of the Minimal AMSB (MAMSb) model is given by m_0, m_3/2, sign(μ), and tan(β). HCAMSb models have a similar setup, but with an additional parameter, Δ, which governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms.

3. The HCAMSb model has a different mass ordering compared to MAMSb, with the wino-like neutralino being the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The model also predicts a large left-right splitting of scalar masses, which can be tested at the LHC. The gluino mass is also expected to be heavy, with a mass around 1-2 TeV.

The results are compared to those of the MAMSb model, and the differences are highlighted. The paper also discusses the implications of the HCAMSb model for LHC searches.

1. The zero-range potential (ZRP) approach is a method for solving scattering problems, which can be improved by using Darboux transformations (DT) to correct the model at low energies. The DT technique allows for the creation of potentials with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum. This approach can be used to dress the ZRP model and improve its possibilities.

2. The ZRP model can be represented as a boundary condition on the matrix wavefunction at some point, and it can be used to study electron scattering by structures such as molecules. The model can be generalized to multi-centered targets, and the partial waves can be expressed as a superposition of green functions. The scattering amplitude can be calculated using the optical theorem.

3. The DT technique can be used to add or remove poles of the S-matrix, which correspond to quasi-stationary states or resonances. The method has been applied to study electron scattering by polyatomic molecules, and the results show that the DT-corrected ZRP model can improve the agreement with experimental data. The approach can be further developed to include higher partial waves and improve the accuracy of the results.",1

The sample is designed to minimize contamination by spurious sources and to provide a reliable catalogue of bright SMGs. The authors use a dual-wavelength extraction technique to combine independent submm and mm maps of the region, resulting in a sample of 19 SMGs, 15 of which are detected securely by deep radio imaging. The radio-undetected sources can be explained by a combination of contamination by spurious sources and the large observed scatter in radio flux densities.

The authors conclude that the bright SMG population is readily amenable to study via radio-selected samples, down to a 850-μm flux density limit of 5 mJy.

1. Rapidity gaps, or regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA and Fermilab Tevatron colliders. These gaps are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons. The simplest model for this exchange is the two-gluon exchange model. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies above 20 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets.

2. The observation of rapidity gaps is significant because it demonstrates that color singlet exchange effects in QCD events are relevant at momentum transfers of order 1,000 GeV. A gap fraction of order one percent was predicted by Bjorken, in terms of a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event. Such multiple interactions would fill the rapidity gap produced in the hard scattering process.

3. Bjorken estimated the color-singlet fraction in terms of the imaginary part of the two-gluon 0-channel exchange amplitude, which is known to dominate the forward scattering amplitude for 0-channel color-singlet exchange. In impact parameter space, the result is a color-singlet fraction of 0.15. This model for the calculation of the color singlet fraction, with the two-gluon exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part, will be called the two-gluon exchange model. The color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons.

4. The two-gluon exchange model predicts a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon initiated processes. The gap fraction should thus decrease with increasing jet transverse energy or pseudorapidity separation. However, recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron do not observe such a decrease. In fact, the D0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse energy, casting doubt on the validity of the two-gluon exchange model.

5. The authors of the paper reconsider the basic ideas behind the two-gluon exchange model and demonstrate its limitations. They show that, even when starting from this perturbative picture of rapidity gap formation, the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative.

2. Load forecasting depends on various factors, including historical load, temperature, humidity, population, and GDP per capita, and the Gaza Strip has seen a 10% annual growth in energy demand from 1999 to 2005.
3. Previous approaches to load forecasting include time series, functional, and soft computing methods, each with their own limitations and inaccuracies.
4. The time series approach, which treats load as a time series signal, is limited by its inability to incorporate weather information, leading to inaccurate results.
5. Functional approaches, which model the relationship between load and weather variables, are often limited to specific geographic areas and may not be accurate for long-term predictions.

The observations were made using the FORS2 spectrograph attached to the VLT Unit 4 (Yepun telescope) at Paranal Observatory.

2. The radial velocity curve of the HeII 4686 emission line shows a periodic variability that is interpreted as the orbital period, which is similar to the period detected by Callanan et al. (1990). The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve is rather small, which might have made it difficult to detect with previous instruments.

3. The Doppler maps of the HeII emission line show a bright spot that appears to have moved over the two nights of observations, suggesting the presence of an irradiated region that shows movement on a longer timescale than the orbital period. This could be connected to a precessing and warped accretion disk.

4. The radial velocity curve and Doppler maps suggest that LMCX-2 might harbor an inclined precessing accretion disk, similar to Hercules X-1 and SS433. This could explain the observed properties, including the change in continuum flux and emission line strengths.

5. The paper detects narrow emission lines in the Bowen region that dominate the Bowen Doppler map, which are thought to arise on the irradiated surface of the donor star. The width of these emission lines suggests that they come from a very compact region in the system.

6. Assuming that the compact spot in the Bowen map is produced on the donor star, the determined velocity of 351±28 km/s must be a lower limit to the center of mass velocity of the secondary. This gives a lower limit to the mass function of the system.

7. The paper sets a lower limit to the mass ratio of the system using the rotational broadening of the narrow emission lines, and an upper limit using the fact that LMCX-2 has a precessing accretion disk. The limits constrain an area in the mass ratio - center of mass velocity plane.

8. The paper speculates that the compact object in LMCX-2 is a neutron star, which would set a tighter upper limit to the center of mass velocity, and that the semi-amplitude of the HeII radial velocity curve is the velocity of the compact object, which would set an upper limit to the mass ratio.",0

1. The axial anomaly is a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, and it has been analyzed deeply over the years using various approaches, including the renormalization procedure and the dispersive approach. The dispersive approach shows that the anomaly is related to the chiral limit and can be interpreted as an infrared effect.

2. The axial anomaly can be derived by studying the properties of the amplitude in the infrared region, and it is related to the non-conservation of helicity in the zero mass limit. This non-conservation is a consequence of the structure of the weak coupling and the angular momentum conservation in the pion vertex.

3. The radiative pion decay with a polarized lepton is a process that exhibits the axial anomaly, and it can be studied using the inner bremsstrahlung contribution. The differential decay rate for a right-handed lepton is finite in the zero mass limit and is related to the axial anomaly.

4. The mass singularities cancellation mechanism in the radiative pion decay with a polarized lepton is different from the unpolarized case, and it is related to the combination of angular momentum conservation in the pion vertex and helicity flip in the photon-lepton vertex. The left-handed case is similar to the unpolarized one, with mass singularities cancelling in the total inclusive decay rate.",1

1. The paper discusses the problem of salient object detection, which involves identifying the most attention-grabbing object in an image. The authors argue that current models are limited by their focus on simple scenes with a single object and lack of consideration for complex scenes with multiple objects. They propose a new approach that addresses these limitations. The approach involves two stages: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.

2. The authors review previous work on salient object detection, including models that use bottom-up and top-down approaches. They note that these models have limitations, such as being biased towards the center of the image and not performing well on complex scenes. The authors also discuss the importance of considering human perception and attention in salient object detection. They argue that models should be able to detect objects that are salient to humans, rather than just detecting objects in general.

3. The authors propose a new dataset for salient object detection, which includes images with complex scenes and multiple objects. They also propose a new evaluation metric that takes into account the complexity of the scene and the number of objects present. The metric is designed to encourage models to detect objects that are salient to humans, rather than just detecting objects in general.

4. The authors discuss the importance of considering the context in which an object is viewed. They argue that the same object can be salient in one context but not in another. They propose a model that takes into account the context in which an object is viewed, including the presence of other objects and the background. The model uses a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches to detect salient objects.

5. The authors evaluate their model on a range of datasets, including their own dataset and existing datasets. They show that their model outperforms existing models on complex scenes and is able to detect objects that are salient to humans. They also show that their model is able to generalize to new datasets and is robust to variations in the input data.

6. The authors discuss the limitations of their model and propose future work to address these limitations. They note that their model is limited by its reliance on a fixed set of features and propose exploring the use of more advanced features, such as deep learning features. They also propose exploring the use of more advanced evaluation metrics that take into account the complexity of the scene and the number of objects present.

2. The authors provide a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of maps induced by two-handle additions in a cobordism between two three-manifolds.
3. The paper uses a multi-pointed triple Heegaard diagram to represent a four-manifold, and associates a map to it, which is defined by counting holomorphic triangles in a symmetric product.
4. The authors introduce the concept of a ""nice"" triple Heegaard diagram, where every unpunctured elementary domain is a bigon, triangle, or rectangle.
5. They prove that for a nice triple Heegaard diagram, the holomorphic triangle counts can be computed combinatorially, and that the maps induced by the diagram are determined by the combinatorial data.
6. The authors show that the index of a holomorphic curve in a nice triple Heegaard diagram is zero, and that the curve can be decomposed into a union of embedded triangles.
7. They also prove that two triangles in the domain of a holomorphic curve can only overlap in a specific way, either being disjoint or overlapping ""head to tail"".
8. The paper concludes that to count index zero holomorphic curves in a nice triple Heegaard diagram, it suffices to count domains that are sums of embedded triangles, overlapping as allowed.",1

1. The invention relates to novel calcium phosphate-coated implantable medical devices and processes of making them, which minimize immune response to the implant and can store and release one or more medicinally active agents into the body in a controlled manner. The coated devices have the capability to store and release medicinally active agents into the body in a controlled manner. The calcium phosphate coating is biocompatible and bioresorbable, and its dissolution into body fluids does not cause side effects. The coating's dissolution rate and microstructure can be controlled to determine drug retention and release characteristics.

2. Cardiovascular stents are widely used in coronary angioplasty procedures to enlarge coronary arteries, but they often lead to harmful side effects such as inflammatory restenosis. The placement of metallic stents can cause damage to the vessel lining, leading to inflammation and/or infection. The mechanisms that lead to restenosis and other immune responses associated with the implantation of a medical device can be diminished through modifications to the surface of metallic implantable medical devices. The most common surface modification of implanted medical devices is the application of a thin polymer film coating.

3. Hydroxyapatite ceramics belong to the class of calcium phosphate-based bioactive materials that are used for a variety of biomedical applications, including matrices for drug release control. The calcium phosphate family of materials has been long recognized as having a high degree of biocompatibility with human tissue. The use of calcium phosphate coatings, including HA coatings, thermally deposited on implantable devices has been limited by the fact that such coatings used to date have had thicknesses of >0.01 mm and have exhibited brittle behavior when in bulk form. This characteristic has limited their use to applications where a solid support structure does not allow for much deformation of the structure.

4. The bonding strength of BM-HA and ECD-HA to metallic surfaces is generally significantly lower than that of sol-gel HA (termed here SG-HA). At the same time, the bonding strength of BM-HA or ECD-HA to previously consolidated hydroxyapatite is high, generally in excess of 40 MPa. Building additional BM-HA or ECD-HA film on top of the already existing, well-bonded to the metallic substrate film of SG-HA provides a novel and inventive route to achieve high bonding strength, controlled porosity, and drug encapsulation capability of the films deposited at room temperature.

The conduits have a spiral structured porous sheet with surface channels and electrospun fibers, which provide superior mechanical strength and integrated multiple channels for cell migration and nutrient transportation. The conduits also have chambers at the proximal and distal ends to reduce tension at the suture line.

2. The spiral structure of the conduit is tunable, allowing for control over the length and diameter of the conduit, making it suitable for repairing long gaps in peripheral nerves. The conduit's mechanical properties can be improved by depositing a dense layer of randomly-oriented fibers on the outside of the spiral structure. This layer also prevents infiltration of scar tissue during nerve regeneration.

3. The conduit's surface channels and electrospun fibers provide guidance for cell migration and directional axonal regeneration, promoting nerve proliferation and neurite extension. The aligned fibers ensure that regenerating axons come into contact with aligned fibers, promoting nerve regeneration. The conduit's porosity and mechanical strength make it suitable for in vivo use.

4. In animal studies, the conduit showed significant improvement in sciatic functional index, compound muscle action potentials, and nerve conduction velocity compared to control groups, indicating functional recovery of peripheral nerves.

The drive member includes a backing flange with gripping means radially extending therefrom, secured by a retaining nut positioned on the opposite side from the backing flange. The retaining nut extends through an opening in the finishing article and has a radial flange at one end thereof seated against the finishing article face. The invention provides a secure attachment of the abrasive finishing article to the power tool.

2. The prior art devices for providing disposable finishing article assemblies have certain disadvantages, such as the use of adhesives, keyed parts, and bulky die-cast mounting hubs. These disadvantages add labor and cost to the manufacturing process. The prior art devices also do not provide additional clamping force during use, which can lead to the grinding wheel rotating relative to the mounting hub. The invention aims to overcome these disadvantages.

3. The invention provides a disposable drive member or hub assembly that is permanently affixed to the grinding wheel without the use of adhesives. The drive member is constructed in such a manner that when the grinding wheel is placed in operation upon the spindle, the grinding wheel is placed in compression.

The unit has at least one pump with a piston that is indirectly drivable by an electric motor via an eccentric. Pressure fluid can be entrained into the eccentric chamber through a sealing ring or the like during pump operation. The invention aims to prevent this pressure fluid from reaching the electric motor and causing damage. The unit is designed to be immersion-proof and can be submerged in water without risk of damage.

2. The invention provides a conduit that extends downward from the eccentric chamber and opens to the atmosphere through the housing block, with a check valve that can open towards the atmosphere. Pressure fluid that has been entrained into the eccentric chamber and drips from the piston enters the conduit and stresses the check valve, causing it to open, and finally flows out of the housing block. This prevents filling of the eccentric chamber with pressure fluid and keeps it away from the electric motor. The unit can be produced economically with fewer conduits and easier cleaning.

3. The invention also provides a housing block that can be used without changing its size or basic internal design, allowing for flexibility in design and production. The engineer can decide how much pressure fluid should be stored in the container. The unit can be designed for different applications, such as avoiding wheel locking or for automatic braking and traction control. The container can be produced using deep-drawing techniques known in the art.

The invention relates to a grounding product for railroad car center plate assembly bowl liners, providing effective grounding without the use of conductive plates, clips, or shunts attached to the liner. The liner material has similar mechanical properties to the liner disclosed in Chierici and Murphy U.S. Pat. No. 4,075,951, but with improved electrical properties. The invention exceeds the NFPA standards by an order of magnitude, with no quantitative AAR standard. The purpose is to assure that any electric charge built up in the car body is discharged through the car trucks to the track rails.

2. Railroad cars have a body resting on and swivelly connected to a pair of trucks adjacent each end of the car, with the swivel connection formed by the car body bolster center plate resting on the truck bolster bowl. The center plate assembly is arranged so that the body bolster center plate will be sufficiently grounded to the truck bolster bowl. The invention eliminates the need for lubrication, which is necessary with manganese steel liners. The invention also eliminates the wear and damage problem in the center plate assembly area of the car.

3. The invention uses a liner composed of a base ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) material with a conductive material additive, such as 2.0% carbon black. The conductive material can be added as a particulate to UHMW-PE in particulate or powder form and then heated under mold pressure for thermoforming.

The present invention relates to weft insertion in a multiple-color air jet loom, and more particularly to a method and an apparatus for inserting a selected weft thread with a weft carrying force appropriate for the selected weft thread. Prior multiple-color air jet looms have a constant weft carrying force, which results in wasted air pressure when inserting thinner weft threads. The invention aims to provide a method and apparatus that can insert different weft threads with suitable weft carrying forces. This is achieved by ejecting air under different pressures or for different intervals of time to produce weft carrying forces suited for the respective weft threads.

2. The invention uses a pneumatic piping system with subnozzles divided into groups along the warp shed to produce different weft carrying forces. The subnozzles are spaced at different intervals to produce combined air streams of varying pressures. The subnozzles can also be operated dependent on the weft thread to be inserted, and the weft carrying forces can be produced by varying the interval of time in which air is ejected or by varying air ejecting forces. The air ejecting forces can be produced by a selective combination of different pitches of subnozzles, different effective cross-sectional areas of nozzle orifices, and different distances of the nozzles from the warp shed.

3. The invention can be implemented in various embodiments, including one where subnozzles have different orifice diameters or are supplied with air under different pressures. Another embodiment uses a directional control valve to supply air under different pressures to the subnozzles. The invention can also be used in an air jet loom employing two different kinds of weft threads, where the air pressure is regulated by a single remotely controlled pressure regulator valve. The pressure regulator valve is responsive to switching command signals for passing air under a pressure appropriate for the kind of weft thread selected for insertion.

4. The invention provides several advantages, including the ability to stably insert various kinds of weft threads through warp sheds since weft carrying forces are available which are suited for the respective different weft threads. When inserting thinner weft threads, the air under pressure is effectively utilized without wasteful consumption. The invention also reduces the occurrence of weft insertion failures, resulting in stabilized weft insertion. Furthermore, the invention is applicable to air jet looms using more than two different weft threads.

5. The invention can be controlled by an electric control system, which includes a switching command unit, an",0

1. The invention relates to a system for deaerating pulp after oxygen bleaching, which is a continuation-in-part of a previous patent application. The problem addressed is the difficulty of washing pulp after oxygen bleaching due to entrained oxygen reducing vacuum on the washer and forming foam. The inventors aimed to create a small deaeration tank that can be placed on top of an oxygen reactor and has no moving parts. The tank would allow steam or oxygen to be recovered.

3. The inventors designed a deaeration tank with an inlet pipe, outlet, and tangential swirl inducing inlet pipe, which provide optimum deaeration. The swirl inducing fluid is the filtrate from the washer after the oxygen bleach. The system allows pulp to be deaerated before being washed, and the tank can be at atmospheric pressure or under low pressure or vacuum. The tank is designed to be small and compact.

4. The overall oxygen process involves pumping pulp through a steam mixer, oxygen mixer, and tower, and then into the deaeration tank. The pulp is then washed and dewatered in a washer. The filtrate from the washer is used as the swirling fluid in the deaeration tank. The system includes valves and sensors to control the flow of pulp and filtrate.

1. The invention relates to the stimulation of crude oil reservoirs to enhance production using a combination of pulsed power electrohydraulic and electromagnetic methods. The method and apparatus provide for the recovery of crude oil from oil-bearing soils and rock formations using pulsed power electrohydraulic and electromagnetic discharges in one or more wells. The discharges produce acoustic and coupled electromagnetic-acoustic vibrations that can cause oil flow to be enhanced and increase the estimated ultimate recovery from reservoirs.

2. The stimulation of crude oil reservoirs to enhance oil production from known fields is a major area of interest for the petroleum industry. The current methods rely on the injection of fluid at one well and use of the injected fluid to flush the in situ hydrocarbons out of the formation to a producing well. However, these methods have limitations, and the effective range of such methods has been limited to less than 1000 feet from the stimulation source.

3. Existing acoustic stimulation methods have demonstrated clearly that they are limited to a range of about 1000 feet from the stimulation point due to the natural attenuation properties of the reservoir. The present invention addresses this issue in a new and innovative way using pulsed power as the source. The pulsed power method generates high-frequency acoustic stimulation of the reservoir separately from the direct acoustic response of the EH shock wave generated by the plasma discharge in the wellbore.

4. The present invention differs from all of the prior art in several ways, including the use of a coupled process of direct EH acoustic vibrations and electromagnetically-induced high-frequency acoustic vibrations. The invention also recognizes that these two effects must occur together to effectively mobilize the oil and increase production of the oil. The problem that arises is that the EM-induced vibrations only occur for a short time after the electrohydraulic or electromagnetic pulse is initiated.

5. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the technique can be applied using a multi-level discharge device that allows sequential firing of several sources in one well in a time sequence that is optimized to allow continuous electromagnetic-coupled stimulation of a large reservoir volume. This approach can be used to extend the effective range of the stimulation by a factor of 5-6 from about 1000 feet.

6. In another embodiment of the invention, the range of the technique is extended by using multiple pulse sources in multiple wells that allow the electromagnetically-induced vibrations to continue for a longer time. This embodiment utilizes a time-sequential discharge pattern that produces a series of electromagnetically-induced vibrations that will last up to",0

1. The present disclosure relates to a splice for a soil reinforcing element, which is used in Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structures such as retaining walls, bridge abutments, and dams. The splice is designed to extend the length of a soil reinforcing element, which is typically limited by manufacturing and transportation constraints. The splice allows for the connection of multiple grid-strips to a soil reinforcing element, enabling the creation of a longer composite soil reinforcing element. This is particularly useful in applications where a longer soil reinforcing element is required to adequately reinforce a vertical facing.

2. The splice includes a first wave plate and a second wave plate, each defining one or more transverse protrusions that receive and seat transverse wires of the soil reinforcing element and grid-strip, respectively. The plates also define perforations that align when the plates are brought together, allowing a connective device to be extended through the perforations to couple the plates. The connective device may be a threaded bolt or similar mechanism, and may be secured with a nut and washer. This configuration prevents the transverse wires from escaping the splice.

3. The soil reinforcing element and grid-strip are typically made up of longitudinal wires and transverse wires, which are welded or otherwise attached together. The transverse wires may be equally spaced or substantially equally spaced along the length of the longitudinal wires. The spacing of the transverse wires may be the same or substantially the same between the soil reinforcing element and grid-strip. The longitudinal wires of the soil reinforcing element and grid-strip may be laterally offset from each other.

4. The splice is secured by coupling the first wave plate to the second wave plate, which clamps down on the longitudinal wires of the soil reinforcing element and grid-strip. This prevents the soil reinforcing element and grid-strip from translating laterally and escaping the splice. The connective device may be tightened to achieve the desired level of clamping force. The splice may be used to connect multiple grid-strips to a single soil reinforcing element, enabling the creation of a longer composite soil reinforcing element.

1. The invention relates to a jointing structure in vehicle traveling path joints and the like having an expansion function, which is adaptable for applications of various tire configurations different in tire diameter. The jointing structure ensures high slip resistance to tires, permits less occurrence of tire fallen-in and/or stuck-in situations, and is easy to be given maintenance. The structure comprises more than one step provided face to face at the coaxially built traveling path ends with an expansion gap between, more than one elastic member respectively mounted inside the steps, and a joint block mounted on the elastic members across the expansion gap. The elastic members are desirably of a material that is hard to be deformed vertically and vice versa easy to be deformed horizontally in a soft manner.

2. The joint block is mounted on the elastic members across the expansion gap, and supporting blocks are mounted inside the steps with the joint block between in order to protect the traveling path ends with the thus mounted supporting blocks so as to prevent the traveling path ends from being damaged due to tire impingement and/or impact responses. The supporting blocks may be of concrete or high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete like the traveling path and the joint block. The supporting blocks are fitted detachably to the intra-step traveling path side walls in close contact therewith with mounting bolts or the like to form a continuously extending traveling path surface. The supporting blocks may be easily restored to normal by replacement even if damaged.

1. The invention relates to track transport systems, specifically floor track systems used in sanitary fluid treatment chambers for transporting food products on wheeled hand trucks. The system is designed to prevent contamination of the treatment fluid by the hand truck wheels.

2. In meat product processing, cooked meat is typically cooled in a chamber using chilled air, which can cause dehydration and shrinkage of the product. More recent approaches use fluid treatment chambers with a chilled brine solution to quickly cool the meat products.

3. The brine solution is recirculated and reused to conserve resources and reduce costs, but this requires maintaining the sanitary condition of the chamber and the solution. The transport system must also maintain the sanitary condition of the chamber and the solution.

4. Overhead rail or trolley systems have been used in cooling chambers, but they have limitations, such as fixing the route of transfer and contaminating the brine solution with lubricating grease. These limitations have been overcome by using wheeled dolly-like floor trucks.

5. However, the wheels of the floor trucks can become contaminated with foreign substances from the processing plant floor, which can contaminate the brine solution. This problem can be circumvented by using air chilling, but this method has its own drawbacks.

6. The primary object of the invention is to provide a floor transport system that allows dolly-like floor trucks to be used in a fluid treatment center without contaminating the treatment fluid. The system should prevent the wheels or support structure of the trucks from contaminating the treatment fluid.

7.

This is an improvement over prior art devices that require adjustment of the suction source or manual adjustment of the suction head. The invention provides a convenient and efficient way to regulate suction.

2. The device has a suction head assembly with a platform, a handle, and roller assemblies that engage the pool bottom. The platform has a central portion with an opening and an upwardly extending cylindrical member that connects to a flexible suction line. The handle is pivotally connected to the platform and is used to move the suction head across the pool bottom. The roller assemblies are connected to the platform and have axles that are vertically adjustable within slots.

The mechanism includes frame members that span the platform and have apertures that receive the axles of the roller assemblies. The frame members are connected to the platform and have adjustment means that allow for vertical adjustment of the axles. This adjustment mechanism enables the suction head to be raised or lowered to change the suction efficiency.

1. The present invention relates to oil well drilling tools and apparatuses, specifically an apparatus for retrieving wear bushings from around the interior of the well head and casing. The wear bushing protects against excessive wear on seal areas of casing heads and other well head elements. The apparatus is designed to retrieve the wear bushing without the use of a drill bit.

2. Wear sleeves or wear bushings are used during oil and gas well drilling to prevent wear on seal areas of casing heads and other well head elements. The wear bushing is equipped with an interior bore smaller in diameter than the width of the bit, allowing it to be loosely incorporated on the drill string. The wear bushing is lowered into position as the drill string is run into the hole and retrieved as the bit is withdrawn.

3. In some cases, it is desirable to retrieve the wear sleeve or bushing without the use of the bit, such as when the drill pipe is lodged and the pipe may be backed off above the drill bit and withdrawn from the hole. A wash over string larger in diameter than the outside diameter of the drill collar and equal to that of the bit itself is used to retrieve the drill collars and bit. The wear sleeve or bushing must be removed to allow the wash over string to pass through.

4. One method of removing the wear sleeve or bushing involves using a retriever body with outwardly protruding dowels or the like that engage a J-slot on the wear sleeve. The retriever body is incorporated into the drill string with a pin and box threaded upper and lower ends. The retriever body must be secured in rigid engagement with the exterior of the pipe to prevent rotation.

The retriever section is adapted with means for engaging an extended J-slot of a wear bushing.

6. The retriever section is free to move vertically along the mandrel section, but is prevented from rotating due to the engagement of insertion members on the retriever unit with grooves on the mandrel section. This allows the retriever section to ""float"" along the length of the mandrel section, preventing damage to the retriever unit or the wear bushing.

1. The invention relates to downhole vibratory tools that allow passage of other tools therethrough, particularly those used to dislodge stuck objects or ""fish"" in deviated wellbores. The tool operates on a principle of applying an overpull to the string supporting the tool and pressure within the string, causing a piston to travel against the bias of a spring. This stretches the string while compressing the spring, eventually leading to a valve opening and relieving pressure.

2. Prior art vibratory tools had limitations, including the inability to allow wireline access through the tool body, and the use of dump valves that were prone to wear and fatigue. These limitations led to the development of new designs, including a drop-in dart that incorporates the working components of the vibratory tool. However, these designs also had their own set of limitations, including miniaturization of components and increased fatigue.

3. The present invention addresses these limitations by providing a tool with a central passage that allows wireline access, and a dump valve that is annularly shaped to avoid wear and fatigue. The tool can be operated in vibratory mode by dropping a removable plug onto a seat, and the dump valve opens and closes without slamming against a seat. This design allows for more reliable and economical operation.

4. The tool features a modular piston stack that can be configured to deliver more power per stroke, and the pistons can travel their entire stroke without being banged against travel stops. The tool can also be operated to apply oscillating forces with or without impacts, depending on the desired operation. This flexibility makes the tool more versatile and effective.

5. The tool has a lower end that is attached to the stuck object or fish, and an upper end that is connected to the surface through a string. The mandrel has a passage that is in fluid communication with the passage in the string, allowing pressure to be delivered from the surface. The passage also allows wireline access when the tool is not in vibratory mode.

6. The tool features a dump valve that is cylindrically shaped and has a seal ring that slides between surfaces to open and close the valve. This design eliminates significant cyclical impacts on opening and closing, and allows the spring to be more robust and long-lasting. The valve is also configured to allow the mandrel to continue moving downhole after the valve opens.

The wall system is composed of two precast modular parts: a face panel with an integral counterfort and a base piece. The face panel has a common height of twenty feet and the counterfort extends from the rear side of the panel.

2. The counterfort has a flat bottom and can have an opening for drainage near the bottom front corner. Reinforcing bars (rebar) are cast within the counterfort, and their ends can terminate in an ""L"" or ""backwards L"" configuration or utilize a forged foot anchor. The rebars act as a tensioning device within the concrete, helping to meet design loads.

3. The base piece is a precast concrete platform, typically one foot thick, with a rectangular or trapezoidal shape. It has openings to accept the downward-extending rebar ends from the counterfort, and a shear key can be made between the face panel or counterforts and the base. The base can also have a front lip that protrudes from the end of the base near the face panel.

4. The connection between the face panel and base is made by inserting an end of a piece of rebar into an opening in the other module and then sealing the connection with grout. The connection is complete once the face and counterfort are connected to the base with grout, and an installer can then backfill the area behind the retaining wall. Multiple retaining walls can be placed adjacent to one another to form a continuous wall.

Additional features can be added to the retaining wall system, such as H-piles driven into the ground underneath the base for added stability, a vehicle impact barrier formed and cast-in-place on top of or behind the wall, or a pre-manufactured, pre-cast barrier formed integrally with the face panel at the factory. These features can be combined in various ways to meet specific design requirements.

MX/a/2011/005499 and MX/a/2010/005899. The entirety of the contents of each application is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The application relates to stave floors, in particular to modular composed stave floors. The example embodiment is directed to a method for the manufacture of composed stave floors.

2. The known stave floors have drawbacks, including the minimum material to be rushed for corrective maintenance being 1 mm, while the sight substrate has a thickness from 2 to 3 mm. The thin sight substrate thickness causes it to warm up and deform upon being sanded or rushed, eventually becoming partially or completely detached. The micro plate or plate that constitutes the sight substrate is ""de-rolled"" wood of the tree trunk, affecting the aesthetic properties of the final product. The base substrate is composed of slung wood or is plated against (triplay).

3. The base substrate and sight substrate are joined by means of glue, which has several disadvantages, including the need for a uniform and level surface of assembly and a constant pressure to reach the desired adhesion. The glue takes a long time to harden, and the pieces must remain static without moving. The composed stave floors have a short life and do not allow for corrective maintenance. The materials are supplied pre-varnished from the supplier, but the thin thickness of the sheet does not offer a solid base of attachment.

4. The problem of joining both sheets of plate is preventing the displacement or change of dimensions. Different factors prevent the sheets from being fixed in a firm way, even though patent application number MX/a/2010/005899 tried to solve the problem. The example embodiment provides a method for the manufacture of composed stave floors that addresses these problems. The method includes providing a sight substrate having a thickness of at least 4 mm and providing a base substrate having a thickness of at least 12 mm.

1. The present invention relates to collated fasteners, particularly a collated nail strip formed with a debris-free plastic material for use in a fastener driving tool. The nail strip includes a row of fasteners arranged substantially parallel to each other, with each fastener having a shank. A collation system is formed from a plastic material that is molded onto and adhered to the fasteners.

2. The plastic material defines a collar portion that captures or at least substantially encircles the fastener shank and a connecting portion extending between and connecting adjacent collar portions. The plastic material is formulated from an adhesive polymer, such as a polyolefin, a polyolefin blend, an epoxy, or the like.

3. The collation system is formed by preheating the fasteners to elevate their temperature, molding the polymer material onto the preheated fasteners, and then cooling the strip to form the fastener assembly. The strip can then be post-heat treated to further enhance the adhesion of the plastic to the fasteners.

4. The present nail strip exhibits a very limited amount of debris compared to known plastic collations, principally because the plastic remains on the nail shank and penetrates the substrate with the nail. The debris that is generated is in the form of a finer material, resulting in less of a housekeeping issue.

5. The nail strip also exhibits increased holding power in the wood, believed to be due to the adhesive nature of the plastic as it embeds in the wood, in conjunction with the adhesion of the plastic to the nail. The plastic flows into the wood structure and bonds with the wood structure, providing even greater holding power.

6. The shape of the collars and connecting portions can be configured to influence or encourage separation of the fasteners from one another at a desired location, reducing the impact on the connecting portion by the fastener as it is driven by the tool into the substrate.",0

1. The invention relates to a waste fuel burner that generates heat from particulate-laden gas or directly from waste fuels like wood waste, and is an improvement over conventional hog fuel burners. The burner aims to produce minimal particulate emissions and can burn wet wood with high moisture content.

2. Conventional wood waste burners are inefficient, producing high levels of pollution and requiring frequent cleaning of boiler heat transfer tubes. The invention addresses these issues by providing a clean-burning waste fuel burner that can deliver exhaust gases as clean as those produced by oil and gas burners.

3. The invention's objectives include emitting minimal particulate materials, operating with little slag or clinkers, burning wet wood, and being self-regulating with fast response times. The burner can also produce a residue that is free of clinkers, assuming the ash fusing temperature is not lower than 1700°F.

4. The burner forms a conical pile of waste fuel, fed from below, with preheated underfire air percolating up through the pile in controlled amounts, drying and gasifying the waste fuel. The volatile gases driven off the pile are then partially oxidized by additional combustion air introduced tangentially with a vigorous swirl.

5. The primary combustion chamber maintains a temperature lower than the ash fusing temperature to prevent slag formation, and the swirl air forces particulate out of the gas stream leaving the primary chamber. The volatile gases are discharged from the throat of the primary combustion chamber around an air-cooled disc or flame holder.

6. The flame holder serves as a barrier against particulate matter, allowing passage of gases, and any entrained particulate matter falls back into the primary chamber. The volatile gases then move into a second combustion chamber where secondary combustion air is introduced to complete combustion.

7. The secondary combustion air is directed tangentially and can be introduced at various axial locations to regulate the position of the flame within the chamber. Additional blend air can be added to the discharge of the secondary chamber to cool the air for industrial purposes.

8. The swirl air and secondary combustion air interact to maintain good separation of particulate from the gas stream leaving the primary chamber, keeping particulate out of the secondary chamber where high temperatures could cause slag formation. The amount of swirl air and secondary air is adjusted based on the moisture content of the fuel.

The mounting links provide a total of six independent constraints on the translational and rotational freedom of the gearbox.

6. The mounting link can be utilized as a medium to long link to connect the engine to an associated structure, such as the gearbox. The link can rigidly constrain one degree of freedom between the engine and the gearbox.

7. In the event of an extreme shock, the pin can break, allowing the male and female links to translate relative to each other and absorb the shock. The radial interface between the male and female links provides coulomb damping to dissipate energy created by the translation.

8. The amount of coulomb damping provided by the radial interface is determined by the coefficient of friction, geometry, and contact areas of the male and female links. The materials of the male and female links can be selected to provide the desired level of coulomb damping.

The valve is designed for use in commercial aircraft cleaning, where multiple users need to accomplish specific cleaning tasks without disrupting each other. The valve must provide a constant pressure cleaning solution to each user with a continuously adjustable cleaning agent to water ratio.

2. The valve system consists of a valve body, a first inlet passage for receiving a first fluid, a second inlet passage for receiving a second fluid, and an outlet passage for providing a proportional mixture of the two fluids. The valve means is adjustable to permit the mixture to range from 0% of the first fluid to 100% of the second fluid. The valve body defines a bore with a predetermined diameter, and the inlet passages are connected to the bore. The outlet passage is also connected to the bore and is open to the bore via a passage disposed perpendicular to the bore.

3. The valve system includes a flow restricting device to reduce the flow rate of fluid from the first inlet passage to the bore. The flow restricting device is a screw with a threaded portion and a flow restricting bore that reduces the flow rate of fluid. The device is made of a material such as 316 S/S and has a torques-type head with a bore extending axially from the center of the receptacle to the end of the screw. The bore is approximately 0.052 inches in diameter.

4. The valve system also includes an elongated valve member that directs the flow of the two fluids in varying proportions to the outlet. The valve member has a cylindrical portion with a bore extending therethrough perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. A sealing sleeve is stretched over the cylindrical portion to allow substantial alignment of the bores when the sleeve is stretched over the cylindrical portion. The sleeve is made of a material such as TEFLON and is somewhat elastic.

5. The valve member further includes a series of consecutive cylindrical spools that are slidably received within the bore when the valve system is constructed. The spools are generally sized identically to each other and are configured to receive a fluid seal ring to retain the two fluids within the bore. The fluid seal rings are made of a material such as VITON and are resistant to chemicals such as detergents and solvents.

1. Electronic components produce heat, and in some applications, free convection cooling is not sufficient to prevent overheating, so electric fans are used to move ambient air across the components at a higher rate. The use of cooling fans is a low-cost solution for keeping electronic components within acceptable temperature ranges. This method is often employed in various applications, including automotive, computer, and electronic instrumentation industries.

2. Cooling fans are typically mounted to an enclosure using fasteners such as screws, dowel pins, or rivets, which increases the product cost due to labor and tooling requirements. The embodiments disclosed in this invention aim to eliminate the need for fasteners in securing cooling fans to an enclosure. This can be applied to various industries where forced air movement is used for temperature control.

3. The cooling fan assembly of the present invention can be used in any application where forced air cooling is necessary, including computer applications. The assembly includes a motor, fan blade, and motor carrier, which are mounted to a panel or stationary member. The motor can be an electric motor, hydraulic motor, or pneumatic motor, depending on the application.

4. The motor carrier includes mounting legs with resilient leg portions that are separated by a compression gap. The panel includes recess portions with openings that correspond to the mounting legs. The motor carrier also includes spring members that urge the carrier away from the panel once the mounting legs are in their fully seated position.

5. The installation process involves bringing the cooling fan assembly into contact with the panel, then applying a combined compressive and rotating force to move the assembly into a partially installed position. In this position, the spring member is compressed, and the resilient leg portions enter an intermediate opening in the panel. The compression gap between the leg portions decreases as the assembly is installed.

6. Further rotation of the assembly moves the resilient leg portions into a residual opening in the panel, where they spring outwardly and are captured. The spring member remains in a compressed state, urging the leg portions against the panel and preventing vibrational noise and movement. This ensures a secure and quiet installation.

7. The present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described and can be modified or added to without departing from the spirit of the invention. The subject matter sought to be protected by this invention includes all fair equivalents of the appended claims. The invention provides a low-cost and efficient solution for securing cooling fans to enclosures in various applications.",1

1. The invention relates to a rolling body guide cage produced from at least one ring element and several guide structures arranged in succession in the circumferential direction. The ring element is composed of at least two flat material ring segments joined to one another in succession in the circumferential direction. The ring segments are connected, in particular welded, to one another in a production step that precedes the formation of the axial profiling.

2. The invention aims to reduce production costs by minimizing cutting waste during the manufacture of rolling body guide cages. The prior art discloses a ball bearing cage composed of two axially profiled ring elements, which generates a relatively large amount of waste material when punched out from a sheet metal material. The invention overcomes this disadvantage by using flat material ring segments that can be punched out in close succession from a sheet metal strip.

The ring element is composed of at least two flat material ring segments joined to one another in succession in the circumferential direction. The ring segments are connected, in particular welded, to one another in a production step that precedes the formation of the axial profiling.

4. The flat material ring segments are put together across an engagement zone and in this engagement zone are welded along edge regions that face one another. The flat material ring segments are connected to one another according to a particular aspect of the present invention in the region of the engagement zones across positively engaging joint contours. These joint contours form an undercut geometry that preliminarily couples the ring elements to one another in the circumferential direction.

5. The flat material ring segments are cut out, in particular punched out, from a sheet metal material. A relatively high material saving can be achieved according to the invention in that the flat material ring segments are formed as 120° ring segments.

1. The invention relates to a system for compensating electromagnetic interfering fields, particularly magnetic fields, using two sensors and a digital processor. The system aims to compensate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields. The system can be used in applications such as scanning electron microscopes (SEM).

2. The system uses two real triaxial magnetic field sensors, three pairs of compensation coils, and a control unit to protect an object from interfering fields. The control unit can be a digital signal processor (DSP) or a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The sensors measure the amplitude of the interfering field at the location of the object.

3. The output signals of the two real sensors are combined to form a virtual sensor signal, which represents the amplitude of the interfering field at the location of the object. The averaging algorithm can be chosen to achieve this representation. The control system receives the output signals of the two real sensors and performs the averaging.

4. The averaging process can be described by a matrix multiplication, where the output signals of the virtual sensor are calculated by multiplying the output signals of the real sensors with a 6x6 matrix. The matrix describes the geometry of the arrangement and how the signals of the two real sensors are combined.

5. The virtual sensor signals are fed into independent control loops operating in parallel, which process the signals further. The control loops can be broadband, selective concerning a frequency range, or selective concerning a frequency. The control loops change the virtual signals into modified signals.

6. The transition from the virtual signals to the modified signals is described by an operator, which can be a matrix or a nonlinear algorithm. The modified signals are then converted into real control signals for the coils. The transition from the modified signals to the control signals is described by a 6x6 matrix.

The compensation field can be homogeneous or inhomogeneous, depending on the nature of the interfering field. The coils can be arranged in a Helmholtz coil configuration.

8. If two compensation systems are operated directly beside each other, feedback effects may arise between the two systems.

2. The effective subtraction operation in a floating point unit is accelerated by using a difference between a subset of signals of the operand exponent arguments to begin the subtraction procedure prior to the availability of the complete difference between the exponent arguments.

The subset difference is used to initiate the subtraction of differences between operand fractions, and the procedures are chosen such that when the complete operand argument difference is different from the subset operand argument difference, the correct result fraction is one of the operand fractions, which is available.

The invention aims to provide a method and system that reduces or avoids such mislabeling of specimen vials.

2. The prior art method of collecting a specimen involves a series of steps, including placing an order to draw a blood specimen, entering the order into a computer, printing barcode labels, and applying the labels to the specimen vials, which can lead to errors and mislabeling. The prior art method is prone to mistakes, and error rates at or close to zero have been an unachievable goal.

The codes are associated with the patient, the order, the specimen-taker, and the specimen container.

4. The method of the invention involves storing the patient's information, the order barcode number, and the patient's barcode number in a relational manner in a database data structure, and then inputting the barcode numbers of the order, the specimen-taker, and the specimen container into the computer. The processor determines if the patient's barcode number and the order barcode number are related to the same patient.

1. The invention relates to the use of waveguide holograms as illuminators for objects with specific illumination requirements, such as display holograms or spatial light modulators. The waveguide holograms are based on thin substrate waveguides, which are characterized by the relationship between the width of the incident laser beam and the thickness of the waveguide. This relationship allows for convenient white light illumination and uniform illumination. The inventors have discovered that these thin substrate waveguides can be used for situations requiring controlled illumination.

2. Conventional illumination systems require a substantial amount of space and contain several optical elements, which can lead to stability problems, alignment difficulties, and obstruction of other light beams. In contrast, waveguide hologram illuminators occupy much less space and can be optically contacted to the objects they illuminate. This compact design makes them more rugged and easier to maintain mutual alignment. Reflection losses at the air-glass interfaces can be reduced by index matching oil or optical cement.

3. The diffraction efficiency of waveguide hologram illuminators can be very high, approaching 0.99, and the absence of stray light propagating forward to the observer is ideal. The undiffracted light from a waveguide hologram illuminator never enters the instrumentation or the eye of the viewer due to total internal reflection at the waveguide surfaces. This results in a high extinction ratio, which is the ratio of the diffracted light to the undiffracted light. The extinction ratio can approach 0.99 for holographic recording of two plane waves.

4. However, there are some penalties to using waveguide hologram illuminators, including critical alignment of the laser beam, which can lead to a lack of ruggedness. There is also a time delay across the hologram, which can build in a clock skew if used for clock distribution. Additionally, nonuniformity of the diffracted wavefront along the propagation direction is inevitable unless combated. This can be done a priori or a posteriori, with a priori compensation being more efficient.

5. The problem of two-sidedness, where the hologram produces two diffracted beams, can be solved by absorbing the light emerging from one side, placing a mirror on one side, or using off-axis illumination. If illuminating spatial light modulators, new possibilities arise, such as diffracting out only polarized light and using the SLM to modulate the polarization. Polarization analyzers can then be used to control or block the unmod",0

The invention relates to an apparatus for automatically spin checking driven disc assemblies used in friction clutches, which ensures that the assemblies are manufactured to have a thickness within closely maintained tolerances and are not excessively warped or non-planar in shape. The apparatus operates automatically without manual involvement by an operator and generates an external indication to the operator of whether the driven disc assembly is good or bad.

2. The prior test fixture for spin checking driven disc assemblies was slow, inefficient, and required several manual operations, and it did not provide an external indication of whether the tested assembly was good or bad. The new apparatus aims to improve upon these limitations.

3. The apparatus includes an enclosure with a stationary ring and a movable ring, a torque motor, and an electronic sensor to measure the distance between the rings. The driven disc assembly is mounted on a splined hub between the two rings.

1. The present invention relates to the field of image processing, specifically face age-estimation, and provides a method and system for estimating the age of a person from a digital image of their face. The invention uses a contourlet appearance model (CAM) to extract features from the face image, which are then used to estimate the age. The CAM is a statistical model that combines shape and texture information to represent the face. The model is trained on a database of images of faces with known ages.

2. The CAM is used to extract feature vectors from the face image, which are then classified as either youth or adult using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM classifier is trained on a database of feature vectors from images of faces with known ages. The classifier outputs a label indicating whether the face is that of a youth or an adult. The classification step is important because the aging process is different for youths and adults.

3. Once the face is classified as either youth or adult, an aging function is applied to the feature vector to estimate the age. The aging function is a mapping from the feature vector to an age, and is learned from the training data. There are two aging functions, one for youths and one for adults, which are learned separately. The aging functions are used to estimate the age of the face based on the feature vector.

4. The invention uses a contourlet transform to extract texture features from the face image, which are then used to estimate the age. The contourlet transform is a multiscale transform that extracts features at different scales and orientations. The features are then used to train the CAM and the aging functions. The contourlet transform is robust to noise and can extract features that are relevant to age estimation.

5. The invention uses a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to learn the aging functions. The SVR algorithm is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns a mapping from input features to output values. In this case, the input features are the feature vectors extracted from the face image, and the output values are the ages. The SVR algorithm is trained on a database of feature vectors and corresponding ages.

6. The invention can be used in a variety of applications, including security systems, age verification systems, and demographic analysis. The system can be used to estimate the age of individuals in real-time, and can be integrated with other systems such as facial recognition systems. The system can also be used to analyze demographic trends and patterns in age distribution.

1. The present invention relates to the field of optical fiber communications, specifically system network design and incorporation of branch powered amplification within such networks. The emergence of practical optical fiber amplifiers has led to a significant expansion in undersea lightwave communications systems, with transmission capacities reaching values in excess of 5 Gb/s. New applications of wavelength-division-multiplexing technologies are expected to further increase system capacities.

2. The focus has shifted from expanding point-to-point capacity to developing more reliable undersea lightwave systems that provide multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity. A ring topology is known to enhance a network's survivability in the event of a cable fault, and combining a trunk and branch structure with a ring geometry provides strong survivability features. This allows all nodes to remain connected in the event of a cable cut.

3. The use of trunk and branch structures within a communication system also enhances network survivability, as a cable cut in the branch isolates a single network node only. A network that combines a trunk and branch structure with a ring geometry exhibits strong survivability features, including maintaining connectivity along the entirety of the trunk and branch network. This allows all nodes to remain connected in the event of a cable cut.

The present invention reduces the number of undersea optical repeaters required by replacing them with remotely pumped optical amplifiers and remotely supplying energy to those optical amplifiers over the same branch cables that distribute communications signals. This approach eliminates the need for additional optical fiber cable runs and achieves amplification of attenuated signals using solely passive repeaterless components.

1. The present invention relates to content synchronization frameworks using dynamic attributes and file bundles for connected devices. The framework allows devices to perform contextual synchronization over various network topologies, including wired and wireless connections. The central reference point, hosted by a server, processes synchronization requests from connected devices and returns responses including bundles identifying files to satisfy the requests. The framework supports both synchronous and asynchronous interaction between the central reference point and connected devices.

2. The synchronization framework provides flexibility to support content synchronization based on device context, which is expressed by the device to the central reference point as dynamic attributes. These attributes are used to compile bundle information for the requesting client, and the content of the bundle is based on the dynamic attribute information provided. The bundles describe the location and properties of content types, such as executable files, libraries, or data, and package this description in a semantic understood by the client. The framework supports multiple languages and appliance operating systems on a single system server.

3. The present systems and methods employ data compression for responses to support limited bandwidth and limited connection time over dial-up or similar connections. The client device composes a delta list of files in the bundle that are different from local copies available to the client device, and the download priority order of the bundle assigned by the central reference point is retained in the delta list. The client retrieves the files in the ordered delta list from various servers indicated in the bundles, and the files downloaded are also compressed to save download time. In the event of communication connection failure, incomplete bundles are rejected.

4. The present content synchronization frameworks provide for creation of a delta list embodying differences between a client's local copy of a file or data and the central reference point indicated file or data. The creation of this delta list is performed by the client device, making the framework highly scalable as the work is distributed instead of being carried out by one server. The central reference point server does not need to store the state of each client device since the appliance creates and maintains this delta list. The framework also provides for caching of most common server responses to make data synchronization more efficient.",1

3. The foil electron multiplier consists of a series of thin foils held by foil holders in an evacuated enclosure, with a voltage applied to each foil to accelerate secondary electrons. The foils are arranged collinearly, and the voltage on each stage can be applied using a resistor divider string or separate power supplies.

4. The gain of the foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, transmission through the support grid, and secondary electron emission yield. The foil material and thickness are selected to optimize the gain.

2. A typical electrical product includes electrical elements positioned in a closed housing to prevent contamination with particles in the air. However, the electrical element tends to be consumed and its lifetime tends to be shortened if it is continuously kept at a high-temperature condition.

3. A conventional fan is composed of a fan housing and an impeller, which produces air streams to dissipate heat generated from the electrical element. The fan housing includes an air inlet and an air outlet in communication with the air inlet via a central, cylindrical air passage.

4. The conventional fan has limitations in its design, including a restricted air passage at the lateral side, optimized design of the blade shape, and wasted space and material of the fan housing. Additionally, air can only be taken into the fan in the axial direction, which limits the improvement in intake airflow rate.

5. The invention provides a heat-dissipating fan and a housing thereof, where an sidewall of the housing extends outwards to enlarge the intake airflow area without modifying the assembling conditions with other elements. The shape of the housing at the air outlet side is kept unchanged to enhance the heat-dissipating efficiency of the fan.

1. The invention relates to the integration of high-dielectric oxide materials with semiconductor substrates, particularly silicon and gallium arsenide. The integration is challenging due to the reactivity of silicon with oxygen, leading to the formation of a low-dielectric constant layer. This layer degrades the properties of the high-dielectric oxide material.

2. High-dielectric oxide materials, such as ferroelectrics, have advantages like ferroelectric properties, size reduction of capacitors, and electrooptic applications. Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric materials are convenient due to their low annealing temperatures, but they are reactive and diffuse into metals. These materials are not thermodynamically stable next to silicon or gallium arsenide.

3. The integration of non-SiO2 based oxides directly or indirectly on silicon is difficult due to the strong reactivity of silicon with oxygen. The deposition of non-SiO2 oxides generally results in the formation of a SiO2 or silicate layer at the Si/oxide interface. This layer is amorphous and has a low dielectric constant.

4. Ferroelectrics with a large dielectric constant can be used to form high-density capacitors, but they cannot be deposited directly on silicon due to the reaction of silicon to form a low-dielectric constant layer. Such capacitor dielectrics have been deposited on ""inert"" metals like platinum, but even platinum or palladium must be separated from silicon with one or more conductive buffer layers. The high dielectric material on a conductive layer has not solved the problem.

5. The large spontaneous polarization of ferroelectrics can be used to form a non-volatile, non-destructive readout, field-effect memory. This has been successfully done with non-oxide ferroelectrics, but much less successfully with oxide ferroelectrics due to the formation of the low-dielectric constant SiO2 layer. The oxide can also poison the silicon device or create interface traps.

6. Ferroelectrics have interesting electrooptic applications where epitaxial films are preferred to reduce loss due to scattering from grain boundaries and to align the oxide to maximize its anisotropic properties. The epitaxial growth on silicon or gallium arsenide substrates has previously been accomplished by first growing a very stable oxide or fluoride on the substrate as a buffer layer.

Current collaborative work-share environments include video conferencing, document sharing, and shared ""whiteboard"" systems, but these systems are often expensive and require dedicated equipment. PC-based products, such as Intel's ProShare and Microsoft's NetMeeting, are more economical and can be deployed on every networked PC.

3. However, these PC-based products are difficult to use, especially for those without technical backgrounds, and require cumbersome setup processes, including establishing IP addresses and launching software. The setup process often requires a separate phone call to coordinate.

This is particularly useful in high speed and high density integrated circuit applications and chip interconnect structures with fine metal features and low dielectric constant insulators.

The invention is particularly useful in damascene type device structures, where adjacent conductors lined with an electrically conductive and diffusion barrier film are disposed in thin trenches in an intralevel dielectric material. Connections are made to levels above and below through metal filled vias in the ILD, and masking is employed both to protect the dielectric material between conductors during processing operations and to assist in patterning those trenches within the interlevel dielectric material.

5. The recessed mask structure is achieved through a unique process that permits both the benefit of having a recessed surface of the mask with respect to a device surface where there may be aspects to avoid, such as high electric field concentration points, and the benefit of having a final mask thickness that is selectable and no thicker than necessary. The process involves removing mask material between points of high electric field concentration after chemical-mechanical polishing, down to a level that is away from the surface where the high fields are located.

The invention provides several beneficial features, including the high field points being away from the cap-mask interface, minimizing damage to the conductive liner, and providing a lower and predictable overall capacitance, which results in faster signal propagation in the interconnect wiring.

The LDA definition covers contacts with federal officials, while the IRC definitions cover contacts with state and local officials, as well as grassroots lobbying. This can result in organizations reporting different information and expenses under LDA and IRC. The differences in definitions can also lead to inconsistent reporting and disclosure.

2. The choice of definition can affect whether an organization must register under LDA and what information it must disclose. Organizations using the IRC definition may not have to register or disclose certain information, while those using the LDA definition may have to disclose more information. This can lead to a lack of transparency and inconsistent reporting. The differences in definitions can also affect the calculation of lobbying expenses and the identification of lobbyists.

3. Options for revising the statutory framework include harmonizing the definitions, eliminating the authorization for using IRC definitions for LDA reporting, and requiring organizations to report only federal lobbying expenses when using an IRC definition. Harmonization would ensure consistent reporting and disclosure, but may require significant changes to the definitions. Eliminating the authorization would simplify reporting, but may increase the burden on organizations. Requiring federal lobbying expenses only would improve comparability, but may not fully address the differences in definitions.",1

1. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been assessing strategic sourcing and its potential value in federal acquisitions for over a decade, and has found that leading companies have made structural changes to leverage their buying power and achieve substantial savings. Strategic sourcing can encompass a range of tactics, including leveraged buying, managing demand, standardization, and better managing supplier relationships.

2. The federal government is not fully leveraging its aggregate buying power to obtain the most advantageous terms and conditions for its procurements, with agencies acting like many unrelated, medium-sized businesses and relying on hundreds of separate contracts for commonly used items. Recognizing the benefits of strategic sourcing, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum in 2005 to implement strategic sourcing practices.

3. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to address government-wide opportunities to strategically source commonly purchased products and services and eliminate duplication of efforts across agencies. FSSI's mission is to encourage agencies to aggregate requirements, streamline processes, and coordinate purchases of like products and services to leverage spending to the maximum extent possible.

4. In 2012, GAO found that most agencies leveraged a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing, with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and Department of Veterans Affairs accounting for 80% of federal procurement spending but reporting managing only 5% of that spending through strategic sourcing efforts. The FSSI program had only managed a small amount of spending through its four government-wide strategic sourcing initiatives in fiscal year 2011.

5. When strategically sourced contracts were used, agencies generally reported achieving savings, with selected agencies reporting savings ranging from 5% to over 20% of spending through strategically sourced contracts. In fiscal year 2011, the Department of Homeland Security reported managing 20% of its spending and achieving savings of $324 million.

6. However, only 15% of government-wide spending for the products and services covered by the FSSI program went through FSSI contracts in fiscal year 2011, with agencies citing a variety of reasons for not participating, such as wanting to maintain control over their contracting activities or having unique requirements. FSSI use is not mandatory, and agencies face no consequences for not using FSSI contract vehicles.

7. Impediments to strategic sourcing in the federal setting include obtaining and analyzing reliable and detailed data on spending, securing expertise, leadership support, and developing metrics. The Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS",0

1. The current surface transportation programs in the United States are not effectively addressing the nation's transportation challenges. The programs are fragmented, with many goals and roles that are unclear, and funding is not linked to performance or outcomes. The Highway Trust Fund, which is the primary source of funding for surface transportation, is facing a fiscal crisis, with expenditures exceeding revenues. As a result, the federal government is facing a significant challenge in meeting the nation's transportation needs.

2. To address these challenges, there is a need for a fundamental transformation of the federal approach to surface transportation. This includes creating well-defined goals and a clear federal role, incorporating performance and accountability into funding decisions, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. Additionally, the federal government should consider new funding and financing options, such as user fees, tolls, and public-private partnerships, to supplement traditional funding sources. By taking a more strategic and sustainable approach, the federal government can better meet the nation's transportation needs and improve the overall performance of the transportation system.",1

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engages in three primary activities: aviation safety oversight, air traffic control (ATC), and airport infrastructure development. The costs associated with each activity depend on the nature and usage of the specific service provided by FAA.

2. The FAA's funding structure is based on a combination of excise taxes and General Fund appropriations, with the majority of funding coming from excise taxes. The Trust Fund, which is credited with revenues collected from system users, provides funding for FAA's capital accounts and operations.

3. The current funding system raises concerns about revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency, as the taxes collected from users do not accurately reflect the costs they impose on the system. This disconnect between revenues and costs can lead to inefficiencies and inequities in the system.

4. The revenue collected from users is primarily influenced by the number of passengers, the average price of tickets, and the amount of fuel used, rather than the costs imposed on FAA. This can result in some flights contributing more than the costs they impose, while others contribute less.

5. The current system does not provide incentives for efficient use of the system, as users are not charged directly for the costs they impose. This can lead to inefficient use of the system, such as airlines operating multiple small flights instead of one larger flight.

6. Alternative funding options, such as a fuel tax, passenger segment tax, weight/distance charges, en-route charges, flight segment charges, and certification charges, have been proposed to address the concerns with the current system. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, and the degree to which they address revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency concerns depends on the extent to which they reflect the costs imposed by users.

7. A fuel tax, for example, has the advantage of being easy to administer and understand, but it may not accurately reflect the costs imposed by users, particularly for heavier planes. A passenger segment tax, on the other hand, may better align revenues with costs, but it only applies to commercial flights and does not account for other FAA activities.

8. Implementing any alternative funding option would require significant administrative and transition issues, including completing cost analysis and developing the organizational capacity to administer and collect charges.",0

1. The National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) is a federal grant program managed by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to improve the accuracy, completeness, and accessibility of criminal history records. The program aims to build a national infrastructure to facilitate the interstate exchange of criminal history and other relevant records.

2. Since its initiation in 1995, NCHIP has provided more than $438 million in federal grants nationwide, and states have made progress in automating their records and making them accessible nationally by conforming with the FBI's standards for applicable national data systems. However, more work remains to be done to achieve universal automation of disposition information.

3. The availability of automated information on the disposition of felony and other potentially disqualifying arrests is critical for conducting background checks of persons purchasing firearms, but such information is not always widely available. Additionally, automated information is not always available to identify other prohibited purchasers, such as persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, adjudicated as mentally defective, or who are unlawful users of controlled substances.

4. The demand for background checks is growing, driven by screening requirements for employment and other noncriminal justice purposes, and technology is not static, necessitating periodic upgrades or replacements of automated systems. The growth in civil fingerprint submissions is partly attributable to 1993 federal legislation that encouraged states to have procedures requiring fingerprint-based national searches of criminal history records of individuals seeking paid or volunteer positions with organizations serving children, the elderly, or the disabled.

5. The overarching goal of NCHIP is important for many purposes, including preventing prohibited persons from purchasing firearms, ensuring the safety of vulnerable populations, and responding to the needs and requirements of homeland security. Continued progress toward establishing and sustaining a national infrastructure will involve a partnering of federal, state, and local resources and long-term commitments from all governmental levels.",1

2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigates contaminated areas and places the most highly contaminated sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) for study and cleanup, with 1,210 sites on the list as of December 1996.
3. After a site is placed on the NPL, EPA extensively studies and evaluates the site to determine the appropriate cleanup remedy, which may include incineration, and selects the remedy based on the site's characteristics and applicable cleanup standards.
4. EPA has selected incineration as a Superfund cleanup remedy 43 times, or about 6% of the decisions on remedies, as of fiscal year 1995.
5. Three incinerators were operating at Superfund sites as of the time of the review, and four additional sites were planned to use incineration.
6. Incineration involves four basic steps: preparing and feeding waste into the incinerator, burning the waste, collecting and cooling the ash, and releasing the cleaned gases into the atmosphere.
7. EPA requires incinerators at Superfund sites to meet RCRA's substantive requirements, such as standards for emissions, and employs four principal methods to ensure safe operation, including setting site-specific standards, incorporating safety features, monitoring emissions, and providing 24-hour on-site oversight.
8. EPA had not fully implemented two methods to promote safe operation, including inspecting Superfund incinerators and systematically sharing lessons learned from one incineration project to another.

1. The Postal Service had about 765,000 career employees at the end of fiscal year 1997, with the largest group being craft employees. The Service structure includes headquarters, 11 areas, and 85 performance clusters, with cluster-level employees making up about 96 percent of the workforce. The EAS workforce consists primarily of employees in EAS 11 through 26 positions, with EAS management-level positions beginning at EAS 16. The PCES includes senior-level officers and executives.

2. The Service's Diversity Development Department was established in 1992 to foster an all-inclusive business environment and support the recruitment, retention, and upward mobility of women and minorities. In 1997, the Service commissioned Aguirre International to study workforce diversity, which reported that the Service was a leader in meeting affirmative action goals but found issues with women and minorities advancing to management jobs. The Service developed an action plan to address these issues and briefed the Board of Governors in 1998. The plan aimed to promote a diverse workforce and improve the representation of women and minorities in higher-level positions.

3. The analysis of the cluster-level workforce in fiscal year 1997 showed that black and Asian men and women, as well as Hispanic men, were fully represented, while Hispanic women, Native American men and women, and white women were underrepresented. The representation of women and minorities in EAS 17 and above positions was lower than in EAS 11 through 16 positions. The Service's headquarters and area office workforces showed similar patterns of underrepresentation. The analysis also found that women and minorities were promoted to EAS 17 and above positions at a higher rate than their representation in the workforce.

4. Aguirre International's study used multiple research methods, including data analysis, policy reviews, and surveys, to assess the effectiveness of the Service's diversity program. The study found that the Service's diversity program was reasonable and relevant, but had limitations due to the short time frame and preselected sites. Aguirre's finding of a ""glass ceiling"" at EAS 17 positions was not supported by convincing evidence, and the Service disagreed with this finding. The Service developed 23 initiatives to address the study's recommendations and improve its diversity program.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) defines a Military Working Dog (MWD) as any canine bred, procured, or acquired to support operations in the protection of installations, resources, and personnel. MWDs are trained to perform various tasks, including explosive and illegal narcotic detection, patrol, tracking, and other requirements.

2. MWDs are removed from service when they can no longer perform their duties due to medical or behavior problems, when they are no longer needed by the military, or in other circumstances, such as when a handler dies in action. The ""Robby's Law"" of 2000 promotes the adoption of MWDs after their military service.

3. The adoption process prioritizes former handlers, followed by others capable of humanely caring for the MWD, and finally, law enforcement agencies. After adoption, the United States is not liable for any veterinary expenses associated with the MWD's pre-adoption condition.

4. The DOD uses three systems to track information about MWDs, including the Working Dog Management System (WDMS), the Central Repository, and the ROVR electronic medical record system. These systems document an MWD's status, medical information, and removal from service.

5. According to data from 2011 to 2015, the number of MWDs adopted or transferred varied, with the highest numbers in 2012 and 2013, while the number of euthanized MWDs varied to a lesser extent. Some adopted MWDs were never deployed outside of their assigned military installations due to performance or medical reasons.

6. Adopted MWDs require preventative care, and common medical conditions include skin, dental, and musculoskeletal issues, which can be treated or resolved.

The population of aliens subject to removal has grown in recent years, with a 24% increase from 2000 to 2005. Aliens who violate immigration laws are subject to removal from the United States, with over 100 violations serving as the basis for removal. ICE investigations resulted in 102,034 apprehensions in 2005.

2. ICE officers exercise discretion throughout the alien apprehension and removal process, with the most discretion exercised in the initial phases. Officers consider various factors, including humanitarian concerns, when deciding whether to apprehend an alien. Discretion is limited for aliens who are investigation targets, such as criminal aliens and fugitives. Officers have more latitude to exercise discretion when encountering aliens who are not targets of ICE investigations.

3. The alien apprehension and removal process involves six phases, with officers exercising the most discretion in the initial phases. During removal proceedings and final removal, ICE attorneys and DRO officers have limited discretion. Circumstances in which ICE might not pursue proceedings include legally insufficient NTAs and aliens serving as witnesses in criminal investigations. ICE attorneys can exercise discretion not to pursue proceedings in certain cases.

4. ICE guidance on the exercise of discretion is not comprehensive and has not been updated to reflect expanded worksite and fugitive operations. Officers rely on formal and on-the-job training, guidance from supervisors, and field operational manuals to inform their decision making. ICE has recently updated some training curricula, but it is too soon to assess the effectiveness of these efforts. Internal control standards state that training should be aimed at developing and retaining employee skill levels to meet changing organizational needs.

5. ICE guidance to instruct officer decision making in cases involving humanitarian issues and aliens who are not primary targets of ICE investigations is not comprehensive. Memorandums issued by ICE units do not offer comprehensive guidance on exercising discretion for aliens with humanitarian circumstances or aliens who are not primary targets of ICE investigations. ICE has recently instituted a worksite enforcement operational guidebook, but it does not include guidance on how officers should factor humanitarian issues into their decision making.

1. Ground ambulance services are provided by various organizations with different structures, staffing, and revenue sources. Medicare payments for ambulance services consist of a service-level payment and a mileage payment. The service-level payment is based on the type of transport provided, and the mileage payment is determined by the number of miles traveled with a patient. The Medicare payment formula has been modified over time, with a 50% increase in the rural mileage rate since 2002.

2. Providers' costs for ground ambulance transports vary greatly, ranging from $224 to $2,204 per transport, with a median cost of $429. The costs per transport reflect differences in provider characteristics, such as volume of transports, intensity of Medicare transports, and level of government subsidies. Super-rural providers have higher estimated median costs per transport than urban providers. The variability in costs per transport is attributed to differences in certain provider characteristics.

3. The median Medicare margin, including add-on payments, was about 2% in 2010 for the 153 providers in the sample. Removing add-on payments resulted in a lower median Medicare margin of -1% for those providers. The results suggest that providers with lower transport volumes generally had higher costs per transport. The increase in ambulance transports from 2004 to 2010 is primarily due to an increase in BLS nonemergency transports.

4. The increase in Medicare beneficiaries' use of ambulance services did not appear to be caused by changes in demographic characteristics of beneficiaries. Factors such as age, race, and sex remained stable from 2004 to 2010 in urban, rural, and super-rural areas. Representatives from an ambulance provider organization suggested that some of the increase in ambulance transports was attributable to increased billing for Medicare ambulance services at the local-government level. The introduction of the national fee schedule in 2002 may have contributed to increased billing.

5. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) has explored increases in ambulance utilization and cited improper payments as one potential cause. Nonemergency transports, including BLS nonemergency transports, made up the majority of improper payments for ambulance services. HHS OIG found that many ambulance transports paid for by Medicare did not meet Medicare program requirements, including transports that were not medically necessary.

The military services have policy and guidance on how to account for, safeguard, conduct physical inventories, adjust if necessary, track, and ship SRC I ammunition within and between services and to contractors for repair. The military services have automated information systems for managing accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition. The department is evaluating various automated information systems to designate one as the DOD-wide authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition.

The federal government is the largest producer, collector, and user of information in the United States, with the Social Security Administration (SSA) being responsible for issuing Social Security numbers (SSNs) and maintaining personal information. SSA collects and maintains personal information such as name, date of birth, address, and SSNs to distinguish among individuals and ensure they receive benefits. The agency's records are protected from disclosure by statute and regulation. SSA's disclosure policy is designed to protect individuals' privacy while permitting the exchange of records required to fulfill its administrative and program responsibilities.

2. The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary law governing the protection of personal privacy by federal agencies, regulating the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information. The act requires agencies to inform individuals of the authority for collection, the principal purpose, routine uses, and consequences of not providing information. The act applies to systems of records maintained by federal agencies and prohibits disclosure without consent, with 12 exceptions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues guidance and oversees agency implementation of the act.

3. SSA's disclosure policy is more restrictive than the Privacy Act and the disclosure policies of most federal agencies. SSA requires additional considerations before disclosing information to law enforcement, including the nature of the alleged criminal activity, the information requested, and which agency made the request. SSA will share information if the criminal activity involves fraud or other violations in Social Security programs, nonviolent crimes and criminal activity in similar benefit programs, or violent and serious crimes. SSA defines violent and serious crimes as those characterized by physical force or threat of physical force.

4. SSA's policy permits the sharing of nontax information with law enforcement under certain conditions, which are more restrictive than the law enforcement exception specified under the Privacy Act. SSA's policy requires the agency to consider several factors before releasing personal information, including the nature of the alleged criminal activity, the information requested, and which agency made the request. SSA's policy is designed to protect individuals' privacy and uphold the pledge of confidentiality made when the agency first began collecting personal information.

5. SSA's disclosure policy is contained in 20 C.F.R. Part 401 and is promulgated through regulations outlined in its ""Program Operations Manual System"" (POMS) and Emergency Messages. The Privacy Officer within SSA's Office of Disclosure Policy has overall responsibility for overseeing the agency's implementation of the disclosure policy. Field locations handle requests for disclosing information because they are at the local level where information is frequently needed.

1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) aims to minimize threats to human health and the environment by regulating hazardous waste management from generation to disposal.
2. RCRA's requirements, including land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements, can create disincentives for cleanups and increase costs and time.
3. The land disposal restrictions, which prohibit disposing of hazardous waste on land unless treated to minimize threats, can be costly and complex to implement, especially for low-risk waste.
4. Minimum technological requirements, designed for facilities managing process waste, can be overly stringent for remediation waste and increase costs.
5. Permit requirements can cause delays and add administrative costs, and parties may try to avoid triggering the permit requirement.
6. EPA has developed policy and regulatory alternatives to mitigate the impact of RCRA's requirements, including the ""contained-in"" policy, permit waivers, and the corrective action management unit (CAMU) rule.
7. While these alternatives have brought some flexibility to RCRA's requirements, they are difficult to use, and their application is inconsistent across states and regions.
8. EPA proposed a comprehensive rule to reform RCRA's requirements for remediation waste, but stakeholders disagreed on the approach, and the agency ultimately decided to withdraw the rule and focus on narrower regulatory changes.
9. EPA believes that comprehensive reform of RCRA's requirements for remediation waste can best be achieved through legislative action, and until then, the agency will work to ensure consistent understanding and application of its existing policy and regulatory alternatives.",1

1. The Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) was established in 1996 to ensure the integrity of the Medicare program, and its funding has increased over the years. From 1997 to 2005, MIP expenditures increased by 63%, from $438 million to $714 million. The program's funding is allocated to five activities: audit, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, and provider education. The allocation of funds among these activities has remained relatively consistent over the years.

2. The allocation of MIP funds is primarily based on historical funding, and CMS does not consider data or information on the effectiveness of each activity. As a result, CMS cannot determine if funds are being spent as effectively as possible or if they should be reallocated. The agency has not evaluated the comparative effectiveness of its program integrity activities, and it does not have a means to compare quantitative data or qualitative information on the activities. This lack of evaluation and comparison hinders CMS's ability to make informed funding decisions.

3. CMS has not optimized the allocation of funds within each activity, and vulnerabilities in certain areas have not been addressed. For example, the allocation of medical review funds is not directly tied to the amount of benefits paid, and the allocation of provider education funds is generally aligned with medical review funding. Additionally, the allocation of benefit integrity funds is not directly tied to the amount of benefits paid in jurisdictions with high incidences of fraudulent billing. CMS's current allocation approach does not ensure that funds are being used effectively to address emerging program integrity risks.

4. The Medicare program is undergoing significant changes, including the addition of the prescription drug benefit and the reform of Medicare contracting, which will require CMS to make new choices in how it allocates MIP funds. CMS plans to use MIP funds to reward contractors for superior performance, but the usefulness of award payments depends on the development and consistent application of performance measures. CMS needs to modify its approach for deciding on funding allocations for and within the five program integrity activities to address emerging risks and ensure that funds are being spent effectively. By developing a method of allocating funds based on the effectiveness of its program integrity activities, CMS can better ensure that MIP funds are appropriately allocated.",1

1. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has faced challenges in ensuring that passenger and checked baggage screeners are adequately trained and performing their duties effectively. Despite efforts to improve screener training, TSA has not fully developed or deployed a recurrent training program for screeners or supervisors. As a result, screeners may not be receiving the training they need to detect threat objects and perform their duties effectively.

2. TSA has taken steps to enhance screener training, including introducing an Online Learning Center, providing leadership and technical training for Screening Supervisors, and requiring screeners to receive 3 hours of recurrent training per week. However, some Field Security Directors (FSDs) have reported difficulties in providing recurrent training due to insufficient staffing and lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at some training facilities. TSA has acknowledged these challenges and is working to address them.

3. TSA has improved its efforts to measure and enhance screener performance, including increasing covert testing and enabling FSDs to conduct local covert testing. However, these efforts have primarily focused on passenger screening rather than checked baggage screening, and TSA has not yet finalized performance targets for several key performance measures. TSA is working to address the imbalance in passenger and checked baggage screening performance data.

4. TSA has established performance measures for the passenger and checked baggage screening systems, but has not yet established performance targets for each of the component indicators. TSA plans to finalize performance targets for the indicators by the end of fiscal year 2005. Without these targets, TSA's performance management system may not provide the agency with the complete information necessary to assess achievements and make decisions about where to direct performance improvement efforts.",1

1. Ginnie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that plays a crucial role in the US mortgage market by providing liquidity to government-backed mortgage loans. It does this by guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are backed by loans insured or guaranteed by government agencies such as FHA, VA, and RHS. This guarantee allows investors to purchase these securities with confidence, providing capital for lenders to make more loans.

2. Ginnie Mae's market share of government-backed mortgage loans has remained relatively stable, but its share of the overall MBS market has declined significantly over the past 20 years. This decline is largely due to the growth of the conventional MBS market, which has become more attractive to investors. As a result, Ginnie Mae's outstanding volume of MBS has also declined.

3. Despite the decline, Ginnie Mae's program income still exceeds its expenses, and it has not had to borrow from the US government to finance its operations. The agency's revenues come from guarantee fees and commitment fees paid by issuers, and it has a reserve of over $10 billion to cover potential losses. Ginnie Mae's excess revenues reduce the federal budget deficit.

4. Ginnie Mae faces challenges in responding to changes in the marketplace and meeting the needs of its stakeholders. It has taken steps to address these challenges, including expanding its product offerings and improving disclosure of loan information to investors. However, it still faces barriers to financing government-backed loan programs, such as limitations on hybrid ARM products in the VA loan guarantee program.",1

1. The Internet's domain name system (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of IP addresses. The DNS is managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private, non-profit organization. ICANN was established in 1998 to take over the management of the DNS from the US government. The transition was intended to be completed by 2000, but it has faced significant delays and challenges.

2. The DNS is a hierarchical system, with top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com and .org, and country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) such as .us and .jp. The root zone file, which contains all TLDs, is maintained by the authoritative root server, currently located in Virginia. The root servers are operated by individual administrators and their sponsoring organizations, and are not funded by ICANN. The DNS relies on a system of domain name servers, which store data linking names with numbers, to translate domain names into IP addresses.

3. The US government has played a significant role in the development and management of the Internet, including the DNS. In 1998, the Department of Commerce issued a policy statement, known as the ""White Paper,"" which outlined the principles for privatizing the DNS, including stability, competition, representation, and private, bottom-up coordination. The Department of Commerce has since worked with ICANN to transition the management of the DNS, but the process has faced challenges and delays. The Department of Commerce is responsible for ensuring that ICANN has the resources and capability to manage the DNS, and will need to decide whether to extend or modify the MOU with ICANN in September 2002.",1

1. In 1998, the VA and DOD began a joint effort to develop a comprehensive, lifelong medical record for each service member, with the goal of sharing patient health information between the two agencies.
2. The initial project, Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR), aimed to create an electronic interface to access data from each other's health information systems, but it lacked a lead entity, clear mission, and detailed planning.
3. The project was rebranded as Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) in 2002, with VA as the lead entity, and it enabled the one-way transfer of data from DOD's health information system to VA's database.
4. The departments then launched the HealthePeople (Federal) initiative, which envisions a two-way exchange of health information between VA and DOD, with the goal of creating a virtual medical record accessible to both agencies' clinicians.
5. To achieve this goal, the departments are developing two new health information systems, HealtheVet VistA and CHCS II, and an interface, CHDR, to link the two systems and enable the exchange of computable health information.

1. There are two approaches to reorganizing or terminating a large financial company: judicial bankruptcy process and special legal and regulatory resolution regimes. The judicial bankruptcy process is governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, while the regulatory resolution regime is governed by the Dodd-Frank Act.

2. The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities, including bankruptcy courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and the Federal Judicial Center. The system is designed to provide a fair and orderly process for resolving financial companies.

3. Large financial companies can file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Code, which allows them to restructure their debts and continue operating. The process typically involves a disclosure statement, a plan of reorganization, and a confirmation hearing.

4. The bankruptcy process is overseen by a trustee or debtor-in-possession, who is responsible for managing the company's assets and operations during the bankruptcy process. The trustee or debtor-in-possession must also negotiate with creditors and other stakeholders to reach a plan of reorganization.

5. The safe-harbor provisions of the Code allow counterparties to terminate and net certain financial contracts, such as derivatives and repurchase agreements, even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay. This can create significant losses for the debtor's estate.

6. The resolution of large financial companies is often associated with complex international, legal, and operational challenges. Different national frameworks and regulatory regimes can create conflicts and challenges in resolving cross-border financial institutions.

7. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), which allows the FDIC to resolve large financial companies outside of the bankruptcy process. OLA provides a regulatory approach to resolution, which can be used in conjunction with the judicial bankruptcy process.

8. The FDIC has proposed a single-point-of-entry (SPOE) approach to resolving systemically important financial institutions under OLA. This approach would allow the FDIC to take control of the parent holding company and transfer assets to a bridge company, while allowing subsidiaries to continue operating.

9. There have been several legislative proposals to reform the bankruptcy process for large financial companies, including the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act and the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act. These proposals aim to address challenges associated with resolving large financial companies, such as the treatment of qualified financial contracts and the role of regulators.

1. The electricity industry consists of four distinct functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. The industry relies on high-voltage transmission lines to transport electricity to local distributors, which then transform it into lower voltage for consumption. The operation of an electric power system requires constant balancing of generation and consumption.

2. Utilities own and operate electricity assets, including generation plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations. System operators manage the electricity flows using control systems, which monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions. Effective functioning of the electricity industry is highly dependent on these control systems.

3. The electricity grid lacked technologies, communications networks, and computerized control devices, but utilities have begun taking steps to update the grid by integrating new technologies and IT systems. The goal is to create a smart grid that is more reliable, efficient, and facilitates alternative forms of generation, including renewable energy. The smart grid would increase the use of IT systems and two-way communication.

4. Initiatives to modernize the grid include installing advanced metering infrastructure, adding ""smart"" components, and using high-resolution monitors to provide more detailed data on the grid's condition. The use of smart grid systems may have several benefits, including improved reliability, downward pressure on electricity rates, and improved ability to detect and respond to potential attacks. The smart grid may also facilitate the use of alternative sources of energy.

5. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates for wholesale electricity sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. FERC approves whether to allow utilities to recover the costs of investments they make to the transmission system, including some smart grid investments. State public utility commissions regulate local distribution and retail sales of electricity.

6. FERC and state regulators play key roles in overseeing the reliability of the electric grid. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is the federally designated U.S. Electric Reliability Organization, and is overseen by FERC. NERC develops reliability standards collaboratively with utilities and others in the industry.

7. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established federal policy to support the modernization of the electricity grid. The act required the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and FERC to take actions to support the development of a framework for smart grid interoperability and cybersecurity. NIST identified cybersecurity standards for smart grid systems and developed guidelines for organizations on how to securely implement smart grid systems.

These gaps impede the government from cost-effectively serving the public and achieving results.

2. By 2020, more than 34% of federal employees will be eligible to retire, with some agencies having particularly high eligibility levels, which can lead to gaps in institutional knowledge and leadership if not strategically managed. Factors such as budget pressures and changing nature of federal work also threaten to aggravate existing skills gaps.

3. The federal pay system does not align with modern compensation principles, and Congress has provided agencies with exemptions to give them more flexibility in setting pay. A market-based and performance-oriented pay system is desirable but challenging to implement.

4. Implementing a results-oriented pay system requires effective performance management systems, a shift in culture, and consideration of total compensation, including base pay, benefits, and deferred compensation. Safeguards are necessary to ensure fairness and transparency in pay decisions.

5. Federal agencies need a hiring process that is applicant-friendly, flexible, and meets policy requirements, and they should make effective use of available tools and flexibilities to build and maintain a high-performing workforce. Congress should hold agencies accountable for doing so.

6. Agency leaders and managers should set an example that human capital is important and directly linked to performance, and they should drive improvements to high-risk areas through sustained leadership commitment and collaboration with other agencies and stakeholders. Identifying root causes of problems and developing action plans is also crucial.

7. OPM has taken steps to improve human capital management, including finalizing revisions to its strategic human capital management regulation and developing a Human Capital Framework. Agencies can use this framework to plan, implement, evaluate, and improve human capital policies and programs.

8. Federal agencies should have a hiring process that is simultaneously applicant-friendly, flexible, and consistent with statutory requirements, and they should analyze the effectiveness of hiring authorities to refine, eliminate, or expand them as needed. OPM and agencies should also track and prioritize occupations for review and updates.

The Global War on Terror (GWOT) has resulted in significant costs for the Department of Defense (DOD), with about 90% of the costs falling into two accounts: military personnel and operation and maintenance. These costs include pay and allowances for mobilized reservists, special payments for military personnel, and transportation of personnel, goods, and equipment.

2. DOD has reported difficulties in estimating the cost of ongoing military operations, as operational requirements can differ substantially from what was assumed in preparing budget estimates. This can result in operations costing more or less than originally estimated.

3. To cover gaps in funding, DOD uses transfer authority to shift funds between appropriation accounts, and reprogramming authority to shift funds within an account. DOD also reduces or defers planned spending for peacetime operations.

4. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received additional funds in their annual appropriations to support GWOT, totaling about $7.9 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. However, DOD and the services lost visibility over these funds and do not know how they were used.

1. The baby boom generation is aging, and this demographic shift will lead to significant changes in the ratio of working-age individuals to retirees. By 2030, there will be fewer than three persons of traditional working age for every person age 65 or over, compared to five working-age individuals for every person 65 or over in 2000. This change will have a major impact on the labor force and the economy.

2. Older workers are becoming a larger proportion of the labor force, and their numbers will continue to grow over the next two decades. In 2000, 18.4 million persons over age 55 were in the labor force, and this number is projected to increase to 31.8 million by 2015. By 2025, older workers will make up 20% of the total workforce.

3. Older workers are employed in a wide range of occupations, with the highest numbers in executive/manager, professional, and service occupations. The composition of the older workforce is shifting towards white-collar occupations, and older workers are more likely to work in these occupations than younger workers. This shift is driven by the greater educational attainment of the baby boom generation.

4. Many older workers want to continue working, but employers have been slow to respond to this desire. Only 16% of employers offer flexible employment arrangements, such as part-time or seasonal work, and these arrangements are often limited to skilled workers. Employers cite a lack of interest and concerns about productivity and costs as reasons for not offering these arrangements.

5. Public employers have been more active in implementing programs to retain older workers, particularly in response to labor shortages in skilled occupations like teaching. These programs often involve pension incentives, such as deferred retirement option plans, that allow older workers to continue working while receiving pension benefits. These programs have been successful in retaining older workers and addressing labor shortages.",1

1. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was established in 1986 to facilitate travel for nationals from qualifying countries, allowing them to enter the US without a visa for business or pleasure travel of 90 days or less. The program has expanded to 36 countries, with the most recent additions in 2008.

2. The VWP has several requirements, including that participating countries must offer reciprocal visa-free travel to US citizens, have a low refusal rate for nonimmigrant visas, and issue machine-readable passports. Countries must also enter into agreements with the US to report lost and stolen passports and share information on known or suspected terrorists.

3. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) was introduced in 2008 as a mandatory requirement for VWP travelers, which collects passenger data and completes security checks before they board a US-bound carrier. ESTA approval is generally valid for 2 years, and applicants can apply online.

4. ESTA has reduced the burden on VWP travelers in several ways, including reducing the frequency of applications, providing earlier notice of ineligibility, and streamlining the processing of passengers at US ports of entry. However, travelers have expressed dissatisfaction with the $14 fee associated with ESTA applications.

5. Carriers are required to verify ESTA approval for VWP passengers before boarding, and compliance has increased over time, with over 99% of passengers verified in 2010. However, DHS has not fully analyzed the risks posed by cases where carriers boarded passengers without verified ESTA approval.

1. The child welfare system in the United States is a complex network of policies and programs designed to protect children, but it has been strained by growing caseloads over the past decade. In 1995, there were approximately 494,000 children in foster care, with 261,000 of them supported by federal funds.

2. The federal government plays a crucial role in financing foster care and establishing minimum procedural requirements for the placement process, including the requirement for states to make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removing children from their homes. If reunification is not possible, the state must find permanent placement for the child outside the family home.

3. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires states to develop a case plan for each child, which must be reviewed at least every 6 months, and a permanency hearing must be held within 18 months to determine the future status of the child. Options for the child's future status include reunification, adoption, or long-term foster care.

4. Many states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time between entering foster care and the first permanency hearing, with 26 states requiring the hearing to be held within less than 18 months. Two states, Colorado and Washington, have shorter time frames for younger children.

5. Some states have implemented operational and procedural changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, such as Arizona's Housing Assistance Program, which focuses on families in which the major barrier to reunification is inadequate housing. This program has resulted in the reunification of 939 children with their families.

6. Other states, such as Kentucky, have placed emphasis on expediting the process of terminating parental rights, which has led to a reduction in the average length of stay between entering care and the filing of the termination petition. Concurrent planning, which involves working on reunification and alternate plans simultaneously, has also been implemented in some states.

7. Evaluations of these initiatives have been limited, making it difficult to assess their overall impact, but some states have reported improvements in speeding up the termination of parental rights and reducing the number of different foster care placements. However, the lack of comparison groups or quality data from the period before the initiative makes it difficult to reach definitive conclusions.

8. Key factors required to meet the challenges of improving the permanency planning process include long-term involvement of officials in leadership positions, involvement of key stakeholders, and the availability of resources to plan, implement, and sustain the project.",0

1. The DATA Act aims to improve federal transparency by requiring agencies to disclose federal expenditures and link agency spending information to federal program activities. The act requires government-wide reporting on a variety of federal funds, including budget and financial information, and tracking of these funds at multiple points in the federal spending lifecycle.

2. OMB and Treasury are responsible for leading the implementation of the DATA Act, with OMB releasing policy guidance and Treasury developing technical guidance and reporting systems. OMB has taken steps to help agencies meet their reporting requirements, including establishing standardized data element definitions and issuing guidance on reporting requirements.

3. Treasury has developed the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) to standardize the way financial assistance awards, contracts, and other financial and non-financial data are collected and reported. The schema includes a broker that extracts award and sub-award information from existing award reporting systems.

4. Agencies face challenges in implementing the DATA Act, including data quality issues, internal control weaknesses, and limitations with financial management systems. These challenges increase the risk that agencies may not be able to report complete, timely, and accurate data.

5. The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) has developed an approach to address the IG reporting date anomaly and maintain early IG engagement with agencies. CIGIE encouraged IGs to conduct readiness reviews to assess agency preparedness to submit spending data.

6. Many agencies have identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in their financial management systems, which may affect their ability to provide reliable and timely financial information. These weaknesses include issues with internal controls, accounting and financial management, and IT security and controls.

7. The DATA Act broker will extract award and sub-award information from four award systems, including the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), the System for Award Management (SAM), the Award Submission Portal (ASP), and the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). However, these systems have known data quality challenges.

8. Agencies have reported challenges in linking their financial and award data using the unique award identifier, and some agencies may not be able to fully meet the May 2017 reporting requirements. OMB and Treasury are aware of these challenges and are working to address them.

9. The agency senior accountable official (SAO) assurance process is intended to leverage existing controls and processes to ensure data quality, but questions remain about the effectiveness of this process in preventing or detecting data quality issues. OMB is still finalizing the SAO assurance",1

1. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) contracted with MPRI for an organizational assessment, but the contracting process was flawed, and the sole-source justification was inadequate. The justification did not demonstrate that MPRI was the only qualified contractor, and the price reasonableness was not properly evaluated. The contracting officer's representative was not properly designated, and unauthorized officials performed contracting officer's representative duties.

2. The OSC did not follow proper procedures for soliciting proposals, and the request for quotes was not documented. The three vendors, including MPRI, did not respond to the same requirement, and the scope of work differed among the proposals. The OSC officials did not evaluate the contractors' prices and did not determine whether the prices were reasonable.

3. The ARC contracting officials did not question the sole-source justification and relied on OSC's input, which was inadequate. The ARC officials did not ensure that the price was reasonable and did not evaluate the contractor's level of effort and mix of labor proposed. The OSC officials did not provide the required price reasonableness documentation.

4. The OSC hired an intermittent consultant, Alan J. Hicks, using the appointment authority under 5 U.S.C. § 3109. Hicks was tasked with reviewing and analyzing OSC program policies and procedures for efficiency and developing a long-term training curriculum. Hicks worked on whistleblower disclosure cases, but this was not part of his original statement of work.

5. The OSC employees who believe a prohibited personnel practice has occurred can file a complaint with OSC, but this process is unworkable when the allegation is against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel. The OSC employees do not have an external, independent agency to represent them, and the process becomes conflicted. The OSC officials are aware of this issue and have considered options for addressing it.

6. The MSPB and EEOC have taken steps to address potential conflicts of interest when their own employees use their respective redress processes. The MSPB uses administrative law judges from the National Labor Relations Board to hear employee appeals, and the EEOC uses contract administrative judges to hear employee complaints. The OSC could consider similar options to address its own conflict of interest issues.

7. The OSC employees could be afforded an external investigation of their prohibited personnel practice allegations against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel through an independent entity. The results of the investigation could be forwarded to the President, who would decide the appropriate action. Alternatively, the OSC employees could be given the right to appeal directly to the MSPB.

1. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing medical care, benefits, and memorials to veterans, and its mission is to promote their health, welfare, and dignity. The department has three main components: the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). These components rely on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits.

2. The VA operates an IT infrastructure to support its medical centers, veteran-facing systems, benefits delivery systems, and memorial services. The department operates around 240 information systems, manages 314,000 desktop computers and 30,000 laptops, and administers nearly 460,000 network user accounts. The systems are used for determining benefits, processing claims, and accessing health records, among other services.

3. The VA's IT systems are old, with some systems over 50 years old, including the Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system and the Benefits Delivery Network (BDN) system. The department plans to replace PAID with a new system in 2017 and BDN in 2018. The VA concurred with the recommendation to modernize or replace legacy systems.

4. The VA's 6-year strategic plan aims to increase veterans' access to benefits and services, eliminate the disability claims backlog, and end veteran homelessness. The plan emphasizes the use of technology to provide more effective care management and improve access to benefits and services. The department is working with other agencies to implement more coordinated data entry systems.

5. The VA reported spending around $3.9 billion on IT resources in fiscal year 2015, with plans to spend around $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2016 and $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2017. The department requested appropriations for various areas, including veterans' access to health care, benefits, and employee experiences.

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for administering the Medicare program, which serves approximately 33 million beneficiaries and processes over 900 million claims annually. HCFA is also responsible for paying and monitoring over 400 managed care health plans that serve more than 5 million beneficiaries.

2. The Medicare program is divided into two parts: Part A, which covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and certain home health care services, and Part B, which covers physician and outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, and ambulance and other medical services and supplies. In fiscal year 1997, Part A covered an estimated 39 million aged and disabled beneficiaries, while a slightly smaller number were covered by Part B.

3. HCFA has slightly less than 4,000 full-time employees, with 65% working in the agency's headquarters offices and the rest working in 10 regional offices across the country. In addition, HCFA oversees more than 60 claims processing contractors that employ an estimated 22,200 people to perform Medicare claims processing and review functions.

4. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) grant HCFA substantial authority and responsibility to reform Medicare, including enhancing anti-fraud-and-abuse activities and introducing new health plan options and payment reforms. These acts address many of the weaknesses discussed in the High-Risk Series report on Medicare.

5. HCFA is facing challenges in implementing the reforms, including the need to develop, modernize, or improve the agency's multiple automated claims processing and other information systems. This includes preparing systems for the year 2000, repairing the deteriorating managed care enrollment systems, and making necessary modifications to existing systems.

6. HCFA managers are concerned about the distribution of agency resources, the need for specialized expertise, the loss of institutional experience, and reorganization issues. They are worried that the quality of other work might be compromised or tasks might be neglected due to the concentrated efforts to implement BBA and solve computer problems.

7. HCFA recently restructured its organizational units to better focus on its mission, but this has caused disruptions and concerns about the loss of experienced staff. Managers are worried that it will be difficult to replace experienced staff in the short term, and new employees will need extensive on-the-job training to replace lost expertise.

1. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is primarily funded by the Trust Fund, which receives revenue from excise taxes on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo shipments, with the General Fund providing additional funding. The Trust Fund provides funding for FAA's capital accounts, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account.

2. The administration's reauthorization proposal aims to change FAA's financing system from one based on excise taxes to one based on cost-based charges, with funding for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) coming from user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft. The proposal also includes the creation of an advisory board and limited borrowing authority for FAA.

3. The proposal's effectiveness in linking costs with revenues depends on the soundness of FAA's cost allocation methodology, which has raised concerns and requires further analysis, and the ability of the proposed funding structure to adhere to the principle of cost-based funding. The proposal's fuel tax rates may not yield the expected revenue, and the creation of an advisory board raises questions about congressional oversight.",1

1. The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for ensuring that federal agencies have access to the telecommunications services and solutions needed to meet their mission requirements. The current program, FTS2001, has two goals: to ensure the best service and price for the government, and to maximize competition for services. The program has awarded two contracts for long-distance services to Sprint and MCI WorldCom.

2. The FTS2001 contracts are set to expire in 2006 and 2007, and GSA is planning a new program called Networx to replace them. Networx aims to provide a comprehensive acquisition that meets agency needs, obtains best value, encourages competition, responds to the changing marketplace, and provides opportunities for small businesses. The program will have two acquisitions: Networx Universal and Networx Select.

3. Networx Universal will provide a full range of national and international network services, while Networx Select will provide leading-edge services and solutions with less extensive geographic and service coverage. GSA expects to award multiple contracts for Networx Universal and Networx Select, with the goal of encouraging competition and obtaining best value. The contracts are expected to be awarded before the expiration of the FTS2001 contracts.

4. GSA faces significant challenges in finalizing the Networx program, including ensuring adequate inventory information, establishing measures of success, structuring and scheduling the contracts, and initiating implementation planning. The agency must also ensure a smooth transition from the current contracts to Networx. GSA has recognized the importance of these challenges and is taking steps to address them.

5. An accurate inventory of existing services and assets is essential for informed acquisition planning decisions. GSA and federal agencies have not yet established comprehensive and accurate inventories, which could hinder the Networx planning process. The agency is examining methods to incorporate better billing and inventory data into the Networx program.

6. GSA has established program goals for Networx, but has not yet defined a comprehensive set of corresponding performance measures. The agency recognizes the importance of establishing measures of success and plans to do so coincident with the finalization of the Networx Universal request for proposals. This will enable effective program management and evaluation of the program's intended business value.

1. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) made over 21,500 grant awards using Recovery Act funds, with awards varying in size, geographic distribution, and research methods. The grants were made to three categories, and the funds were obligated within a 2-year window. The act required recipients to report on the number of jobs supported by the Recovery Act on a quarterly basis.

2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed recipient reporting guidance and a nationwide data collection system, where grantees must report the number of jobs supported by the Recovery Act in terms of full-time equivalents (FTEs). NIH officials reported that HHS assesses the quality of reports filed by NIH Recovery Act grantees. NIH collects information about FTEs supported by the Recovery Act from the nationwide data collection system.

3. NIH grantees submit annual progress reports to NIH, which include information on the goals and progress of their research. NIH is also participating in the development of a multiagency collaboration called Star Metrics to track the employment, scientific, and economic impacts of its funded research projects. NIH gathers information from principal investigators working on priority research areas and prepares publicly available reports about the potential scientific impacts of NIH-funded research.

4. The number of FTEs supported by NIH Recovery Act funds generally increased from December 2009 through September 2010, then remained steady from December 2010 through June 2011. According to NIH officials, Recovery Act funds could eventually support a total of approximately 54,000 FTEs. The Star Metrics program is expected to provide additional information about the number and types of jobs funded by the Recovery Act.

5. Five grantee institutions were selected for further review, and data reported by these institutions showed a general increase in FTEs. Principal investigators reported that the Recovery Act funding supported new positions, and allowed them to avoid reductions in the number of employees or hours worked by current employees. The majority of job positions supported by NIH Recovery Act funds were part-time, with a mean number of hours worked per week of about 20.

1. The concept of transit-oriented development (TOD) varies, but it generally refers to compact, mixed-use, and walkable neighborhoods located near transit stations. TODs can range in size and scope, and can be found in urban, suburban, and rural areas. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) does not have a discrete program for TOD, but it has been expanding its role in TOD through funding research and coordinating with other agencies. FTA plans to distribute $19.98 million in grant funding to state and local agencies in 2015.

2. Stakeholders identified several conditions that support TOD, including market demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and efficient access to jobs and activity centers. Market demand is driven by the strength of the local economy, and developers consider anticipated price growth and existing housing supply when determining locations for new development. TODs are more likely to succeed in areas with strong local economies and high demand for housing. The availability of large parcels of land, such as surface parking lots, can also support TOD.

3. Challenges that can hinder TOD include higher construction costs, lenders' reluctance to finance TOD projects, lengthy or discretionary local approval processes, unsupportive local populations, and unattractive physical features surrounding transit stations. Construction costs can be higher for TODs due to the cost of mixed-use buildings and parking garages. Lenders may view TODs as riskier than traditional developments, and local approval processes can be lengthy and uncertain. Unsupportive local populations and unattractive physical features can also make it difficult to develop TODs.

4. Local governments can use various policies to encourage TOD, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. Zoning codes can be designed to facilitate TOD by allowing for greater density and mixed-use development. Station area plans can provide guidance on land use, transportation, and housing, and can help resolve contentious issues. Targeted infrastructure investments, such as pedestrian amenities and shuttle services, can also support TOD.

5. FTA assesses several factors that can support TOD when reviewing transit projects for funding, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, congestion relief, economic development effects, land use, and cost-effectiveness. The land use criterion evaluates factors such as the development character, pedestrian facilities, parking supply, and affordable housing in the project corridor. FTA also considers local policies and plans that support TOD, such as transit-supportive zoning and station area plans.

1. The federal government provided approximately $88 billion in funding for hurricane relief and recovery efforts through four emergency supplemental appropriations acts, with FEMA receiving $42.6 billion and 22 other agencies receiving $45.4 billion. However, there is no framework or mechanism in place to collect and consolidate information on how these funds are being spent.

2. FEMA's reports to the Appropriations Committees do not provide timely and useful information from a governmentwide perspective, as they do not reflect the actual obligations and expenditures of agencies performing mission assignments on behalf of FEMA. FEMA's reported obligations and expenditures for mission assignments are overstated, and its reported expenditures are understated.

3. The process of FEMA issuing mission assignments to agencies and the obligation of FEMA's funds related to the mission assignments is complex, and agencies performing mission assignments do not record obligations until they actually perform or contract for the work. This results in FEMA's reported obligations being overstated from a governmentwide perspective.

4. The reimbursement process for agencies performing mission assignments also creates timing differences between FEMA's and the agencies' records, resulting in FEMA's reported expenditures being understated. FEMA does not recognize reimbursements to other agencies as expenditures in its accounting system until it has reviewed and approved the supporting documentation.

5. Some performing agencies have not provided billing documentation that meets FEMA's requirements, resulting in FEMA ""charging back"" the monies from these agencies through the IPAC system. This has resulted in FEMA not recognizing these amounts as expenditures, even though the performing agencies claim they have expended those amounts.

6. There is no central collection point to compile and report on how the $88 billion in hurricane relief and recovery funds are being spent, making it difficult for decision makers to determine if additional funds should be provided, if funds already provided could be deemed excess, or if funds should be rescinded. Without a framework and mechanisms in place to collect and consolidate information, decision makers will not have complete and consistent information on the uses of the funding.

1. The use of program evaluations in decision making is crucial for improving program performance, and factors such as leadership support, staff involvement, and evaluation relevance to decision makers facilitate evaluation use. However, barriers to evaluation use include lack of resources to implement findings, difficulty distinguishing between program results and external factors, and lack of staff knowledgeable about interpreting evaluation results. Despite these challenges, evaluations can provide valuable insights into program effectiveness and inform decisions about program management and policy.

2. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010 aims to increase the use of evaluation in decision making by requiring agencies to develop strategic plans and performance goals, and to conduct quarterly performance reviews. However, mid-level managers may not be involved in these reviews, and evaluations may not be used effectively in decision making. To address these issues, agencies can engage staff throughout the evaluation process, provide technical assistance on evaluation and its use, and develop written evaluation policies and standards.

1. The federal government has taken steps to improve the employment of individuals with disabilities, including the issuance of Executive Order 13548, which aims to increase the hiring and retention of people with disabilities in the federal workforce. The order requires federal agencies to develop plans to increase the employment of individuals with disabilities and to report on their progress. However, nearly two years after the order was signed, the federal government is not on track to achieve its goals.

2. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has developed criteria for agencies to follow in creating their plans, but many agency plans do not meet these criteria. OPM has provided feedback to agencies on their plans, but many agencies have not addressed the deficiencies identified. Regular reporting on agency progress could help ensure that agencies address these deficiencies.

3. Training is essential for hiring managers and human resource personnel to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to proactively recruit, hire, and retain individuals with disabilities. OPM is developing mandatory training programs, but these programs are not yet complete. Agency officials have expressed a need for more comprehensive training on the tools available to them, including the requirements of Schedule A hiring authority.

4. The accuracy of government statistics on the number of individuals with disabilities in the federal government is a concern, as it relies on voluntary disclosure. The extent of underreporting is unknown, and unreliable data hinder OPM's ability to measure progress towards the executive order's goals. Determining the accuracy of SF-256 data is essential for ensuring that OPM can measure progress towards the executive order's goals.

5. To improve the employment of individuals with disabilities, OPM should incorporate information about plan deficiencies into its regular reporting, expedite the development of mandatory training programs, and assess the accuracy of SF-256 data. OPM has begun taking steps to address these issues, including notifying agencies that it will report remaining deficiencies to the president and on the OPM website. OPM is also working to develop guidance for agencies to encourage voluntary self-disclosure through annual re-surveying of the workforce.",1

1. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is developing the Automated Land and Mineral Record System (ALMRS) to manage public lands and resources, with a total life-cycle cost estimated at $403 million. The system aims to automate land and mineral records, provide information for land and resource management, and increase public access to BLM records.

2. The ALMRS/Modernization project consists of three components: ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (ALMRS IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems. The project is expected to provide an efficient means to record, maintain, and retrieve land description, ownership, and use information.

3. As of 1995, about $296.2 million had been appropriated for ALMRS/Modernization, with $262.8 million obligated. The project is expected to stay within the agreed-upon funding limit of $403 million for fiscal years 1983 through 2002.

4. The development of ALMRS IOC software is on schedule, with three builds planned, and the final test of the software to convert existing data files to INFORMIX is scheduled to be completed by January 12, 1996. The administrative systems rehost effort is also on schedule, with all 13 planned software applications and related databases converted from COBOL to INFORMIX.

5. The project schedule is tight, with little time available to deal with unexpected problems, and slippages could occur, impacting project cost and completion plans. BLM has taken actions to closely monitor the project status and schedule to avoid slippages.

6. BLM plans to perform a 30-day acceptance test of the ALMRS IOC at pilot sites to assess functionality and performance in an operational setting, but the stress-test plans do not examine how the entire ALMRS/Modernization will perform under peak workload conditions. The Bureau should stress test the entire ALMRS/Modernization to ensure that all systems and technology can process the workloads expected during peak operating periods.

7. The GAO recommends that the Director, BLM, ensure that the entire ALMRS/Modernization is thoroughly stress tested before it is deployed throughout the Bureau, and BLM has agreed to do so. The Bureau has also contracted for an independent verification and validation of the ALMRS IOC software in response to direction by the House Committee on Appropriations.",1

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an independent organization affiliated with the United Nations, with 138 member states, and its governing bodies include the General Conference and the 35-member Board of Governors. The IAEA derives its authority from its statute, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and regional non-proliferation treaties. The agency's objectives are to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program.

2. The IAEA has developed the Additional Protocol, which allows for more comprehensive information about a country's nuclear activities and enables the agency to conduct complementary access to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. The protocol has been signed by 78 countries, but its implementation is limited by the need for countries to bring it into force. The IAEA has also established two new offices to focus on open source and satellite imagery data collection. The agency uses various types of information to verify state declarations, including inspections, environmental samples, and satellite imagery.

3. Despite successes in detecting previously undisclosed nuclear activities, the IAEA faces limitations in its ability to detect undeclared activities, and its conclusions cannot be regarded as absolute. The agency's ability to implement strengthened safeguards is limited by the lack of information about the nuclear activities of four key countries that are not members of the NPT. The IAEA is also facing a looming human capital crisis, with many senior safeguards inspectors and high-level management officials retiring in the next five years.

4. The Nuclear Suppliers Group, a multilateral export control regime, has helped stop, slow, or raise the costs of nuclear proliferation by establishing guidelines governing exports of nuclear materials and equipment. The group has also helped IAEA verify compliance with the NPT by requiring members to adhere to IAEA safeguards standards at facilities using controlled nuclear-related items. However, the group's effectiveness is limited by the lack of complete export licensing information sharing among members and the need for consensus decision-making.

5. The United States has provided significant assistance to Russia and other former Soviet countries to secure nuclear material and warheads, detect illicitly trafficked nuclear material, eliminate excess stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear material, and halt the continued production of weapons-grade plutonium. The U.S. has also provided radiation detection equipment to 36 countries to combat nuclear smuggling. However, U.S. assistance programs have faced",0

1. The Year 2000 computing crisis poses a high risk to critical services provided by the government and private sector, including financial transactions, flights, power, and national defense. The crisis is caused by the inability of many computer systems to process dates beyond the year 2000, which could lead to system failures and disruptions. The government and private sector must work together to address this issue, as it is a complex problem that requires a coordinated effort. The consequences of inaction could be severe, including widespread disruptions to essential services and economic losses.

2. The government has made some progress in addressing the Year 2000 problem, but much work remains to be done. Many agencies have not yet completed their assessments of their systems, and those that have are still in the process of renovating and testing them. The government must establish clear priorities and develop contingency plans to ensure that critical services are maintained in the event of system failures. Additionally, the government must work with the private sector to ensure that data exchanges between systems are Year 2000 compliant.",1

1. The Information Quality Act (IQA) requires federal agencies to ensure the quality of information they disseminate, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of IQA. OMB issued guidelines for agencies to follow, which include developing their own IQA guidelines and establishing a correction mechanism for information errors.

2. Many agencies have implemented IQA guidelines, but some independent agencies have not, and OMB has not provided sufficient guidance or oversight to ensure compliance. OMB's lack of guidance has resulted in inconsistent implementation of IQA across agencies.

3. The number of IQA correction requests has decreased significantly since the first year of implementation, and most requests are from businesses, trade groups, and other profit-oriented organizations. Substantive requests, which require more time and resources to address, account for a larger proportion of total requests.

4. OMB and agencies do not track the costs or resources associated with implementing IQA, and there is no mechanism in place to measure the impact of IQA on agency operations or the quality of information. Despite this, evidence suggests that addressing IQA requests can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly for substantive requests.",1

1. Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and channel them back to the economy through investments and loans.
2. The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining since the 1960s, with companies increasingly tapping securities markets for their financial needs.
3. The household sector has also become less dependent on bank loans, with mortgage portfolios being sold to financial intermediaries who use them as collateral for marketable securities.
4. The process of securitization has supplanted bank credit as a source of finance, even if the borrower originally received funds from a bank.
5. The impact of mutual funds on deposits refers to both direct withdrawals and customers' diversion of new receipts that otherwise might have been placed in deposits.
6. The total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990-1994 were $1,067 billion, but the impact on deposits had to be less than this amount since there were also flows into mutual funds from nondeposit sources.
7. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should have little effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy.
8. Mutual funds have further advanced the securitization process, with their investments in securities becoming a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending.
9. The availability of finance for residential, consumer, and business borrowers could be disproportionately affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds, even when the total supply of loanable and investable funds is not affected.

1. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 requires specific activities related to bioterrorism preparedness and response, including improving coordination and planning, developing priority countermeasures, and enhancing state, local, and hospital preparedness and response. The Secretary of HHS is responsible for establishing an integrated system of public health alert communications and surveillance networks. The networks are to allow for secure and timely sharing and discussion of essential information concerning bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. Since fiscal year 2002, HHS has funded over $2.7 billion for public health preparedness efforts.

2. The federal government's role in disease surveillance is to collect and analyze national disease surveillance data and maintain disease surveillance systems. Federal agencies investigate the causes of infectious diseases and maintain their own laboratory facilities. They also use communications systems to share disease surveillance information. CDC's major IT initiative, known as PHIN, is a national initiative to implement a multiorganizational business and technical architecture for public health information systems.

3. CDC's PHIN initiative includes several applications, such as the Health Alerting application, Epi-X, NEDSS, BioSense, and the Outbreak Management System. The Health Alerting application is used to broadcast e-mail alerts to state and local public health officials about disease outbreaks. Epi-X is a secure, Web-based communications system for sharing information on public health emergencies. NEDSS promotes the use of data and information systems standards for the development of interoperable surveillance systems.

4. BioSense is an early event detection system that provides near real-time event detection by using data from existing health-related databases. The Outbreak Management System is an application designed for case tracking during the investigation of disease outbreaks. CDC's LRN Results Messenger utility is used by DHS's BioWatch initiative for transmitting data to CDC. The PHIN Messaging System is available for use, but only CDC and a few states and local public health agencies use it.

5. DHS is pursuing two major biosurveillance IT initiatives - the National Biosurveillance Integration System and the Biological Warning and Incident Characterization System (BWICS). BWICS is associated with three other biosurveillance programs. Of these five, one is operational, but it has interoperability and other limitations, one is a demonstration project, and three are in development. The one DHS surveillance initiative that is operational - BioWatch - is an environmental monitoring system that was developed and implemented within a 3-month period.

1. The survey of large sponsors of defined benefit (DB) pension plans revealed that many have made changes to their benefit offerings over the past 10 years. These changes include revising benefit formulas, converting plans to hybrid designs, and freezing plans. The reasons for these changes vary, but unpredictability of DB plan funding requirements and global or domestic competitive pressures were cited as key factors.

2. The survey also found that many sponsors have made changes to their health benefit offerings, with 46% no longer offering retiree health benefits to active employees hired after a certain date. The majority of sponsors reported that they had increased or did not change employer contributions to 401(k) plans, and many are planning to implement automatic enrollment features. The survey suggests that the trend towards reducing or eliminating retiree health benefits may continue in the future.

3. The survey's findings suggest that the private pension system is facing significant challenges, with many sponsors expressing pessimism about the future of DB plans. Few sponsors reported that they would consider forming a new DB plan, and those that did cited conditions such as greater scope in accounting for DB plans on corporate balance sheets and reduced unpredictability or volatility of plan funding requirements. The survey's results add to the evidence of weaknesses in the existing private pension system, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider alternative models for retirement security.",1

1. The Refugee Act of 1980 established a systematic procedure for admitting refugees to the United States and provides comprehensive and uniform provisions to resettle refugees quickly and encourage self-sufficiency. The President determines the maximum number of refugees to be admitted each year, and the number actually resettled is typically below this maximum. The federal government, along with private organizations, coordinates the admission and resettlement process.

2. Refugees are assigned to national voluntary agencies, which decide where they will live in the United States, with approval from the Department of State. The agencies consider factors such as housing availability, employment opportunities, and community capacity when making these decisions. However, the process can be inconsistent, and some communities may not be adequately prepared to receive refugees.

3. The Department of Homeland Security approves refugees for admission, while the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration processes refugees overseas and provides funding for initial resettlement services. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, located within the Department of Health and Human Services, provides funding for cash and medical assistance, as well as social services, to help refugees become self-sufficient.

4. Refugees can bring economic benefits to their new communities, such as filling labor shortages and starting businesses. They also enrich cultural diversity and can attract investment from overseas businesses. However, they can also strain local resources, such as school districts and health care systems, which may not be adequately prepared to serve them.

5. Refugees who exhaust federal benefits and are not self-sufficient can strain local safety nets, such as food pantries and homeless shelters. Secondary migration, where refugees move to a new community after initial resettlement, can also strain local resources and create challenges for service providers. Federal funding does not always follow refugees to their new communities, making it difficult to provide timely assistance.

6. The Office of Refugee Resettlement provides grants to communities affected by secondary migration, but the annual cycle of these grants may not provide timely assistance. ORR also collects secondary migration data, but it is limited and may not accurately reflect the number of refugees moving into or out of a community.

7. Some communities have requested restrictions or moratoriums on refugee resettlement due to concerns about their ability to provide services. The state of Tennessee has created a process for communities to request a temporary moratorium on resettlement for capacity reasons.

1. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to provide government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, aiming to reduce federal costs for repairing flood damage.
2. The program has several challenges, including charging premium rates that do not fully reflect the risk of flooding, limiting costs to taxpayers, encouraging broad participation, and promoting private market participation.
3. To address these challenges, NFIP needs to increase premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss, including catastrophic losses, which would require reducing or eliminating subsidized and grandfathered rates.
4. Mitigation efforts, such as elevation, relocation, and demolition, can reduce flood damage to properties and communities, helping to put NFIP on a firmer financial footing and reducing taxpayers' exposure.
5. Expanding participation in NFIP could help share the risks of flooding among more policyholders, but it would require careful implementation to avoid increasing the concentration of high-risk properties and ensuring that newly added properties pay full-risk rates.
6. Encouraging private market participation could transfer some or all of the federal government's risk exposure to private markets, but it would require identifying ways to achieve this goal without increasing taxpayers' exposure.

The OCIE examines mutual funds to evaluate their compliance with federal securities laws and assess the effectiveness of their compliance control systems.

2. SEC has made significant changes to its traditional examination approach, focusing more on sweep and cause examinations, and less on routine examinations, to better detect potential violations and emerging risks. The agency has also established teams to monitor the largest and most complex groups of affiliated advisers and mutual funds.

3. SEC's revised examination priorities and oversight processes are intended to focus the agency's resources on the largest and highest risk funds and activities, but they also involve significant tradeoffs that raise regulatory challenges. The agency may not be able to examine all mutual funds within a reasonable period, which could limit its capacity to accurately distinguish higher risk funds from lower risk funds.

4. SEC's quality control measures for examinations could be improved in three areas: supervisory review of risk scorecards, preparation of written examination plans, and review of completed examinations and work papers. The agency's standards do not require supervisors to document their review of risk scorecards, and written examination plans are not required for routine examinations.

5. Federal bank and other regulators have quality control measures that provide assurances above and beyond those used by SEC, such as requiring supervisors to document their review of examination work papers and preparing written examination plans. These measures help ensure that examinations are conducted according to procedures and are done consistently across field offices.

6. SEC does not review completed examinations and work papers as done by other regulators to determine whether the examinations were conducted according to procedures or done consistently across field offices.

1. The First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc. had a high concentration of loans to the energy industry in the Southwest United States and was regarded as a principal lender in that industry. By the mid-1980s, the energy industry experienced financial difficulties, which affected First City's financial condition. In 1986, First City reported operating losses.

2. In 1988, First City entered into a recapitalization agreement with the FDIC, which included a $970 million capital infusion and a guarantee of $100 million payable in 1998. The agreement also required the creation of a ""collecting bank"" to dispose of certain troubled assets held by the subsidiary banks. The recapitalized First City banks embarked on an aggressive growth policy, which resulted in increased assets and profits.

3. However, the growth policy was short-lived, and the banks' loan portfolios included high-risk loans, such as loans to finance highly leveraged transactions, international loans, and out-of-territory lending. By September 1990, problems with the quality of the loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded the banks' capital. An OCC examination report strongly criticized the lending practices of First City-Houston.

4. In 1991 and 1992, First City, OCC, and FDIC considered alternative resolution plans, including acquisition by a stronger institution, major capital infusion, and self-rescue through consolidation or sale of subsidiary banks. However, these plans were ultimately rejected due to various reasons, including the estimated cost to FDIC and the lack of sufficient capital. OCC determined that First City-Houston was insolvent and appointed FDIC as receiver in October 1992.

5. The FDIC placed the failed First City banks into interim bridge banks, which were sold to acquirers in January 1993. The sale resulted in a surplus of about $60 million, which was higher than FDIC's initial estimate of a $500 million loss. The surplus was attributed to the premium paid by the acquirers, which was substantially more than the 1-percent premium on deposits that FDIC had estimated.

6. The resolution of First City banks offers valuable lessons for FDIC and other regulatory agencies. These lessons relate to the importance of realistic assumptions, adequate safeguards, and thorough documentation in providing financial assistance and closing troubled banks. Consultation between regulatory agencies might have led to more realistic assumptions and a better understanding of the likelihood of success of the financial assistance.

The Single Audit Act of 1984 was passed to improve oversight and accountability of federal funds provided to state and local governments, and it requires entities receiving $500,000 or more in federal awards to undergo a single audit. The act aims to promote sound financial management, reduce burdens on grantees, and ensure federal agencies rely on audit work done pursuant to the act.

2. The single audit process has been plagued by quality issues, with a 2002 study finding that 51% of audits had significant deficiencies, and a 2006 study finding that 35.5% of audits were unacceptable. The most common deficiencies included lack of documentation, inadequate testing of internal controls, and noncompliance with laws and regulations.

3. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) conducted a study in 2006 that found similar quality issues, with 49% of audits deemed acceptable, 16% having limited reliability, and 35.5% being unacceptable. The study recommended a three-pronged approach to improve audit quality, including revising standards and guidance, establishing minimum training requirements, and enhancing disciplinary processes.

4. The PCIE study found that audits of entities with $50 million or more in federal expenditures had a higher rate of acceptability than those with smaller expenditures, and that the majority of federal dollars were covered by a small percentage of total audits. This suggests that targeted efforts to improve audit quality for larger grantees could have a significant impact.

1. Medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides coverage to elderly and disabled beneficiaries, with two main parts: hospital insurance (Part A) and supplemental medical insurance (Part B). Claims are processed by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers. Intermediaries process Part A claims, while carriers process Part B claims.

2. The contracting process for Medicare differs from other federal programs, with no full and open competition for intermediary or carrier contracts. Instead, intermediaries are selected through a nomination process by provider associations, and carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers. This process was intended to encourage hospital participation in Medicare.

3. The Social Security Act allows Medicare to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which governs federal contracting. Medicare contractors are reimbursed for necessary and proper costs, but do not earn profits, and cannot be terminated without a public hearing. This limits the program's ability to adapt to changing needs.

4. Medicare could benefit from contracting reforms, such as allowing direct competition for contracts and expanding the pool of eligible contractors. This could lead to improved efficiency, performance, and program management. It could also address concerns about the dwindling number of insurers willing to contract with Medicare.

5. Allowing Medicare to contract with entities other than health insurers could increase the pool of potential contractors and improve program management. This could include data processing firms, consulting organizations, and other types of companies. The program could also benefit from functional contracting, where separate contractors specialize in specific claims administration activities.

6. Functional contracting could lead to better program service, as contractors focus on specific tasks and develop expertise. For example, separate contractors could handle beneficiary inquiries, educate providers about program policies, or focus on program safeguards. However, this approach also poses challenges, such as coordinating activities and ensuring seamless service.

7. Offering financial incentives to contractors for high-quality performance could also improve program operations. This would require repealing cost-based reimbursement restrictions and allowing Medicare to award contracts that provide financial incentives and permit profits. However, this approach also poses challenges, such as developing effective evaluation criteria and ensuring that incentives do not compromise program integrity.

8. Allowing Medicare to terminate contractors more efficiently could promote better program management. Currently, contractors can terminate their contracts without cause, while Medicare must demonstrate substantial failure or disadvantageous continuation. Eliminating the public hearing requirement and allowing Medicare to terminate poor performers more quickly could improve program accountability.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) aims to increase investments in modernization without increasing overall defense budgets by reducing support operations and infrastructure costs. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requested the Defense Science Board (DSB) to identify DOD activities that the private sector could do more efficiently. DSB issued two reports in 1996 addressing outsourcing and other opportunities for reducing DOD support services.

2. The first DSB report focused on outsourcing and privatization, concluding that DOD could realize savings of 30 to 40 percent of logistics costs by outsourcing support services. The report cited evidence from the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) public-private competition studies of commercial and depot maintenance activities. The Board also noted that the private sector saved about 10 to 15 percent by outsourcing, and the public sector savings would be higher due to government service organizations' inefficiency.

3. The second DSB report provided a new vision where DOD would only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities, with all other activities outsourced to the private sector. DSB estimated that DOD would need to invest about $6 billion but would ultimately save about $30 billion annually by 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions. The estimated savings included $6 billion from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities.

4. According to DSB, the $6 billion savings represents an approximate 40-percent reduction in the $14 billion DOD spends annually for CONUS logistics activities. However, the estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is conservative, and the actual cost may be higher. The Navy reported that more than $8.5 billion of Navy resources was applied in fiscal year 1996 to maintenance programs in support of fleet ships and aircraft.

5. The report also stated that to gain economies and achieve significant savings, DOD needs to consider dramatic changes in the way it does business. DSB recommended that DOD get out of the material management/distribution and repair business by expanding contractor logistics support to all fielded weapon systems and by expanding the use of ""prime vendors"" for all commodities. Contractor logistics support combines depot-level maintenance with wholesale and selected retail material management functions.

BOR shifted its mission emphasis from water project construction to water resources management and consolidated its facilities into the Reclamation Service Center.

3. The General Services Administration (GSA) reduced its workforce by 4,535 FTEs between fiscal years 1993 and 1996, with the Public Buildings Service (PBS) accounting for the largest percentage of downsizing. To maintain performance, PBS reengineered its work processes and took steps to build and maintain employee skills. PBS moved from being a mandatory source of services to being a provider of choice, competing with other providers in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness.

4. The components of the five agencies generally believed that they had maintained performance during downsizing, and customer satisfaction remained high. However, some officials and employees expressed concerns about the sufficiency of current or future workforces and the potential impact on performance. The agencies identified lessons learned, including the importance of involving employees in planning and implementing downsizing, being open and honest with them, and providing training and support to help them cope with change.",1

1. The IRS designed the National Research Program (NRP) to obtain new information about taxpayers' compliance with tax laws, with a focus on voluntary filing, reporting, and payment compliance.
2. The NRP's reporting compliance study consists of three major processes: casebuilding, classification, and taxpayer audits, with the goal of obtaining accurate voluntary reporting compliance data.
3. IRS plans to use NRP data to update return selection formulas, design prefiling programs to help taxpayers comply with tax laws, and focus resources on areas of noncompliance.
4. The NRP sample consists of 46,860 tax returns, with IRS estimating that classification will result in face-to-face audits of about 39,000 taxpayers, correspondence audits of 2,300, and no audit for 3,800.
5. IRS has implemented quality assurance measures, including reviews of classification decisions and audits, to ensure the accuracy of NRP data.
6. The agency has also built in data consistency checks to verify that audit results are accurately recorded in the NRP database.
7. IRS plans to survey taxpayers who receive NRP audits to assess their perceptions of the burden posed by those audits and to identify ways to improve interactions with taxpayers.
8. The agency has consulted with outside stakeholders to enhance its efforts to minimize the burden NRP creates for taxpayers with returns in the sample.

1. The Bureau of the Census is planning for the 2010 census, which is a complex and costly project that requires meticulous planning. The census is a decennial event that is mandated by the Constitution and is critical for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives and allocating federal funds. The Bureau's plan for the 2010 census involves a ""three-legged stool"" approach, which includes a short-form-only census, the American Community Survey (ACS), and a modernized Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) system. The Bureau believes that this approach will improve the accuracy and efficiency of the census.

2. The Bureau's plan for the 2010 census is an improvement over its plan for the 2000 census, but it still has some weaknesses. The Bureau has not yet developed a comprehensive project plan that integrates all aspects of the project, including milestones, costs, and performance goals. The Bureau's cost estimates are also sensitive to assumptions about key drivers, such as enumerator productivity and response rates. The Bureau needs to provide more transparency and detail about its assumptions and cost estimates to Congress and other stakeholders.

3. The Bureau's plan for the 2010 census faces several challenges, including the need to secure congressional approval and funding, the risk of delays and cost overruns, and the difficulty of counting a growing and diverse population. The Bureau's decision to use a short-form-only census and the ACS is a significant departure from past censuses, and it is unclear whether this approach will be successful. The Bureau also needs to address concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the ACS data. The Bureau's ability to overcome these challenges will depend on its ability to manage risks and adapt to changing circumstances.

4. The Bureau's cost estimates for the 2010 census are high, with a total life cycle cost of $11.3 billion in current dollars. The Bureau's cost estimates are driven by the need to modernize its systems and processes, including the MAF/TIGER system and the use of handheld mobile computing devices. The Bureau's cost estimates are also sensitive to assumptions about enumerator productivity and response rates. The Bureau needs to provide more transparency and detail about its cost estimates and assumptions to Congress and other stakeholders.

5. The Bureau's planning process for the 2010 census can be improved by adopting best practices from project management and business process reengineering. The Bureau needs to develop a comprehensive project plan that integrates all aspects of the project, including milestones",0

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has established a framework to ensure the privacy and security of Medicare beneficiaries' protected health information (PHI) when data on prescription drug use are used for purposes other than their direct clinical care. This framework includes regulations, guidance, and enforcement activities to protect PHI.

2. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act require HHS to establish standards for the privacy and security of PHI. The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules set forth requirements for covered entities and business associates to protect PHI.

3. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing HIPAA's privacy and security requirements, including investigating complaints and conducting audits. OCR has developed guidance and outreach materials to assist covered entities and business associates in complying with HIPAA requirements.

4. OCR has established an enforcement process that includes investigating complaints, conducting compliance reviews, and imposing civil money penalties for noncompliance. The office has also developed a pilot audit program to assess covered entities' compliance with HIPAA requirements.

5. The HITECH Act requires OCR to issue guidance on de-identifying PHI, but the office has not yet issued this guidance. OCR officials stated that the guidance will explain and answer questions about de-identification methods and clarify guidelines for conducting the expert determination method.

6. OCR has not fully established a capability to proactively monitor covered entities' compliance through periodic audits, as required by the HITECH Act. The office has not determined how to include auditing business associates in its audit program.

1. The Military Health Service System (MHSS) has a mission to provide medical readiness, which includes providing medical support to active-duty military personnel and maintaining the health of the active-duty force during peacetime. The MHSS also provides care to non-active-duty beneficiaries, such as dependents and retirees, when resources are available. The role of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in meeting the MHSS medical readiness mission is to provide mental health care that helps military personnel perform their duties. The MHSS has more psychiatrists than needed to meet its medical readiness requirements.

2. The Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP) was established to train military psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication for mental illness. The project was created in response to a conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1989 DOD Appropriations Act. The PDP was designed to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military so they could treat patients with psychotropic medication when needed. The Army's Office of the Surgeon General was tasked with designing and implementing the PDP.

3. The PDP faced several problems during its implementation, including a lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified participant selection criteria, and changes to the curriculum and training duration. The project also faced delays in granting prescribing privileges to graduates and issues with supervision. Despite these challenges, the PDP produced seven prescribing psychologists who are currently practicing at DOD facilities. The project's cost-effectiveness is unclear due to the lack of information on the proportion of time prescribing psychologists would spend performing functions that psychiatrists would normally perform.

4. The PDP's implementation was evaluated by the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP), which noted that the project's goal was ""rich with ambiguities."" The ACNP recommended that the MHSS define the role of prescribing psychologists and their scope of practice, as well as the types of psychotropic medication they would be qualified to prescribe. The MHSS did not address these concerns, and the project continued to face challenges. The PDP's cost was substantial, with an estimated $6.1 million spent on the project through the completion of the proctored year for participants.

5. The MHSS has no current or upcoming need for clinical psychologists who may prescribe medication, and the cost of producing prescribing psychologists is substantial. The PDP demonstrated that training psychologists to prescribe drugs can reduce psychiatrists' workloads in some cases, but it is unclear whether the project would save DOD money. The MHSS does",0

1. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large deployable, infrared-optimized space telescope that will find the first stars and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their current formation. The telescope is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope and will be launched in October 2018. The project has experienced significant increases to project costs and schedule delays.

2. The JWST project is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining, but all of JWST's elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the project's critical path, potentially reducing schedule reserve further. The project has used schedule reserve in 2015 to address various technical problems that have arisen, including issues with the ISIM heat straps and OTE cryogenic harnesses. The project must complete five integration and test periods, three of which have not yet started.

3. The cryocooler, which is required to cool the infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin, has experienced technical challenges that have used schedule reserve and delayed its delivery. The cryocooler remains a schedule risk as it begins testing, and JPL must complete acceptance and end-to-end testing in a more schedule-compressed environment. The project has removed some tests from the acceptance and end-to-end testing to accommodate the delay in the delivery of the compressor assembly.

4. The project identifies and maintains a list of risks that need to be tested and mitigated to an acceptable level in the next 3 years, with approximately 25 of these risks not likely to be closed until the conclusion of the observatory integration and test phase. The project's mission systems engineers have developed justifications and mitigation strategies for its single point failures, and project officials expect these to be summarized and submitted to the agency prior to launch. The project's approach is consistent with other high-priority NASA missions.

5. The JWST project has managed to stay within its allocated budget for the fourth consecutive year since the 2011 replan, but the project's fiscal year 2016 budget request to Congress is consistent with its cost commitment. The project used a portion of its cost reserves to address technical challenges, including funding activities to address significant delays with the cryocooler. The project estimates that the overall cryocooler development cost will be nearly 250 percent higher than baselined at the 2011 replan.",1

1. The chemical sector is a high-risk target for terrorist attacks, and experts agree that chemical facilities pose a significant threat to human life and the environment. Despite this, there is no comprehensive assessment of security at the nation's chemical facilities.

2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates around 15,000 facilities under the Clean Air Act, which requires them to prepare risk management plans to prevent and prepare for accidental releases. These facilities produce, use, or store hazardous chemicals and are referred to as RMP facilities.

3. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has initiated efforts to identify high-priority facilities, develop protective programs, and exchange information with the private sector. DHS has also developed a risk assessment methodology to compare and prioritize critical infrastructure assets.

4. Industry associations have been active in promoting security among member companies, with some requiring members to assess vulnerabilities and implement security enhancements. However, the extent of participation in these voluntary initiatives is unclear.

5. Chemical industry officials face challenges in preparing facilities against terrorist attacks, including the cost of security improvements, determining the level of security required, and lack of threat information. They also face difficulties in conducting vulnerability assessments and employee background checks.

6. Existing laws do not give DHS the authority to require all high-risk facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and take corrective action. DHS has concluded that its existing authorities do not allow it to effectively regulate chemical sector security.

1. Social Security is a vital program in the United States, providing benefits to over 49 million beneficiaries, including retirees, disabled workers, and dependents. The program faces financial challenges, and reform proposals aim to improve its solvency.

2. The program's benefits are calculated based on a progressive formula, with lower-income earners receiving a higher percentage of their earnings in benefits. The benefits are also indexed to inflation to maintain their purchasing power.

3. Disabled workers and dependents are particularly vulnerable to benefit reductions, as they may not have the financial resources to adjust to changes in their benefits. They may also have higher health care costs and rely heavily on Social Security income.

4. Reform elements, such as price indexing and longevity indexing, would reduce benefits for disabled workers and dependents, with price indexing having the largest impact. These reductions could create new hardships for these beneficiaries.

5. Protection options, such as full and partial exemptions, could mitigate the effects of benefit reductions for disabled workers and dependents. These options could be targeted to specific populations, such as widows and dependent children.

6. A full exemption would keep benefits at current law levels, while a partial exemption would exempt beneficiaries from reforms until a certain point in time, such as the full retirement age. A super COLA could also be used to increase benefits for disabled workers and dependents.

7. Protections for dependents could include increasing the percentage of the worker's benefit that they receive or raising the maximum benefit a family could receive on a single worker's earnings record. These options could help protect child and other dependent benefits.

8. Widow(er)s may be particularly affected by benefit reductions, as they may rely on Social Security for a large percentage of their retirement income. A ""widow's boost"" could allow them to receive up to 75% of the couple's combined benefits.

9. While protecting the benefits of vulnerable populations is desirable, it comes at a cost to the Social Security program's solvency. Further benefit reductions or revenue increases would be needed to achieve program solvency, which could create new financial vulnerabilities among other beneficiaries.",1

1. The United States has a large share of coal-fueled electricity generating units, which provide about 29% of the country's total net summer generating capacity. In 2012, there were 1,309 coal-fueled generating units in the US, with a total of 309,680 megawatts of net summer generating capacity.

2. To address concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste, several environmental laws were enacted, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. These laws led to the proposal of four key regulations that will affect coal-fueled units.

3. The four regulations have potentially significant implications for public health and the environment, including reducing SO2 emissions by over half in covered states and reducing mercury emissions by 75% from coal-fueled electricity generating units. These reductions will have positive impacts on human health, particularly for asthma and related health issues.

4. In addition to these four regulations, the EPA proposed new regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating units, aiming for overall reductions equivalent to 30% from 2005 emissions levels by 2030. The proposed regulations include state-specific goals for carbon dioxide emissions and guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve these goals.

5. DOE, FERC, and EPA have taken initial steps to implement a formal, joint process to monitor industry progress in responding to the four EPA regulations. This process includes regular meetings with key industry stakeholders and the development of a coordination memorandum to identify how the agencies will work together.

6. System planners and operators attempt to avoid reliability problems through advance planning of transmission and generation resources, and coordinating or determining operational decisions such as which generating resources are operated to meet demand throughout the day. The role of a system planner can be carried out by individual power companies or Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).

7. RTOs provided information to the agencies on retirement notifications and associated impacts, the status and findings of reliability assessments, and data on planned outages. RTO officials told us that they gathered this information by surveying owners of generating units to identify decisions related to retiring or retrofitting specific generating units.

8. DOE, EPA, and FERC have taken individual steps to monitor industry progress implementing EPA regulations, including offering technical assistance, conducting outreach, and updating power sector modeling tools.

1. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) does not systematically determine the eligibility of all estates kept open for more than 2 years, as regulations require, and the quality of the determinations varies. This lack of oversight allows estates to continue receiving farm program payments without ensuring they meet the necessary requirements.

2. Under the 1987 Act, farm program payments may continue to an individual's estate for 2 years after their death if the estate meets certain eligibility requirements, and can continue beyond that if the estate remains active and is not kept open primarily to receive payments. However, FSA must annually determine that the estate is still active and not being kept open primarily to receive payments.

3. A review of FSA case files found that only 39 of 181 estates received annual eligibility determinations for each year they were kept open beyond the initial 2 years, and 69 estates had at least one annual determination but not with the required frequency. The longer an estate was kept open, the less likely it was to receive all required determinations.

4. FSA did not conduct any program eligibility determinations for 73, or 40 percent, of the 181 estates that required a determination from 1999 through 2005, and 22 of these estates had received no eligibility determinations during the 7-year period. Some of these estates received significant farm program payments, including one that received over $741,000.

5. Even when FSA conducted eligibility determinations, there were shortcomings, such as approving eligibility with insufficient information or vague explanations for keeping the estate open. In some cases, FSA approved program payments to groups of estates without any apparent determination.

6. The extent to which FSA field offices make eligibility determinations varies from state to state, suggesting inconsistent implementation of eligibility rules. In 16 of the 26 states reviewed, FSA field offices made less than half of the required determinations.

7. FSA's lack of management controls, such as computer matching with the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, makes it difficult to verify that payments are not being made to deceased individuals. This lack of oversight resulted in $1.1 billion in farm program payments to 172,801 deceased individuals from 1999 through 2005.

8. FSA's lack of management controls also makes it difficult to prevent improper payments to deceased individuals, particularly in complex farming operations such as corporations and general partnerships with embedded entities. These types of entities accounted for a disproportionately high share of post-death",0

1. The review found that the franchise funds, GovWorks and FedSource, did not always follow federal contracting procedures to ensure value while expeditiously acquiring goods and services. DOD customers chose to use franchise funds based on convenience, rather than as part of an acquisition plan. DOD conducted little analysis, if any, to determine whether using franchise funds' contracting services was the best method for acquiring a particular good or service. The franchise funds' business operating principles require that they maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors.

2. The review found that GovWorks and FedSource did not compete orders they placed under multiple-award contracts or perform analyses to ensure fair and reasonable pricing. FedSource commonly used multiple-award contracts to make purchases for DOD. When placing orders against multiple-award contracts, DOD is generally required to ensure that contract holders have a fair opportunity to submit an offer and have that offer fairly considered for each order. FedSource did not provide contractors the opportunity to submit offers for orders under multiple-award contracts and have their offers fairly considered.

3. DOD customers told us that they did not formally analyze contracting alternatives but generally chose to pay GovWorks and FedSource to provide contracting services because the franchise funds provided quick and convenient service. Some customers were dissatisfied with the speed and quality of services provided by DOD's in-house contracting offices. The franchise fund's ability to place orders quickly was valuable to DOD customers in these situations. DOD customers said that franchise funds' contracting services were less restrictive than other DOD contracting alternatives.

4. The review found that DOD customers did not consider opportunities to leverage their buying power when using franchise funds. None of the DOD customers we spoke to analyzed trade-offs between total price, including fees, and the benefits of convenience. For example, on a group of work assignments for construction services valued at $7.2 million, the Army's Fort McCoy paid FedSource a total of about $1 million, or 17 percent above the subcontractor's proposed price, for the contractor markup and the franchise fund fee. Most of these assignments were placed towards the end of the fiscal year.

5. The review found that GovWorks and FedSource did not define desired outcomes and the specific criteria against which contractor performance could be measured and paid limited attention to monitoring contractors' work. As we have reported previously, it is not always clear where the responsibility lies for such critical functions as describing requirements, negotiating terms, and conducting oversight.

1. Wildland fires play a crucial ecological role in shaping the composition of forests and grasslands across the United States. Fires have long been a natural part of these ecosystems, and they can stimulate seedling regeneration and growth in some species. However, various land use and management practices over the past century have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems, leading to abnormally dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation. This has increased the risk of large and severe wildfires.

2. The risk of wildland fires is particularly high in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where development has increased over the last several decades. The WUI contains 46 million single-family homes, representing about 40 percent of single-family homes in the United States. Many of these homes are located in areas with high fire risk, and the average number of structures burned by wildfire each year from 1999 through 2015 was 2,750. In addition to residential development, other assets that support communities, such as power lines and recreational opportunities, are also at risk from wildland fires.

3. Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce the risk of wildland fires, including fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. Fuel reduction can reduce the severity of wildland fires, slow fire spread, or make fires more manageable. Federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities to prioritize, plan, and conduct fuel reduction activities. The Cohesive Strategy, issued in 2014, emphasizes the importance of coordination across multiple agencies and frames comprehensive goals to mitigate wildland fire risk.

4. Leadership, community engagement, and agency resources are also critical factors in reducing wildland fire risk. Dedicated federal agency and community leadership can enhance collaboration and encourage communities to take action to reduce risk. Engaged communities that understand the issues associated with wildland fire and are willing to take action to reduce risk are more likely to collaborate with federal agencies. Agency resources, including funding and personnel, are also essential for carrying out risk-reducing activities and supporting collaboration with nonfederal entities.",1

1. Pension plans invest in hedge funds and private equity to achieve specific goals, such as reducing volatility, obtaining returns greater than the stock market, and diversifying their portfolios. Hedge funds and private equity investments pose challenges beyond those of traditional investments, including specific investment risks, limited transparency and liquidity, and operational risks. To mitigate these challenges, pension plans take steps such as developing a clear investment purpose and strategy, negotiating important investment terms, conducting due diligence, and investing through funds of funds. Despite these efforts, some pension plans, especially smaller ones, may not be equipped to address the demands of hedge fund and private equity investing.

1. The U.S. Department of State manages the visa process, which involves several steps, including documentation reviews, in-person interviews, and biometric data collection, to determine who will be issued or refused a visa.
2. Despite recent improvements, many visa-adjudicating posts still face challenges in managing their workload, leading to long wait times for visa interviews, with 29 posts reporting maximum monthly waits exceeding 30 days over a 6-month period.
3. State has implemented measures to increase productivity and better manage visa workload, including deploying temporary duty staff, upgrading embassies and consulates, and implementing procedures to maximize efficiency, but these efforts are generally temporary and insufficient to meet expected increases in demand.

1. The number of school-aged children with limited English proficiency in the US has grown dramatically, from less than 1 million in 1980 to over 3.5 million in 1998, with California, Florida, New York, and Texas having the largest numbers. Other states, such as Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee, have also experienced significant increases.

2. The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) was passed in 1968 to educate students with limited English proficiency, and its 1994 reauthorization created four bilingual education grant programs: Program Development and Implementation Grants, Program Enhancement Projects, Comprehensive School Grants, and Systemwide Improvement Grants. These programs are the only federal programs that specifically target instructional services to children with limited English proficiency.

3. The four programs share the same performance goals and measures, possess similar eligibility criteria, and allow similar uses of program funds, targeting students with limited English proficiency in kindergarten through 12th grade. The overall objectives of these programs are to provide bilingual or special alternative education programs to children with limited English proficiency and to help them reach high academic standards.

4. The programs have similar services, including instructional activities and materials, professional staff development for teachers and teacher's aides, and family education programs, but the precise nature of the services varies by district and school. Grantees use these services to improve local programs, define local program goals and objectives, and measure student outcomes such as academic achievement.

5. The effectiveness of the four bilingual education programs on a national level is unknown because locally collected data are not comparable, and grantees use different assessment tests and define terms differently. However, Education may be able to garner some information about how well local bilingual education programs are meeting program goals by comparing local data with Education's performance standards.

6. Consolidating the four bilingual education programs into one program could provide benefits, including reducing applicant burden, allowing Education to redirect resources to other activities, and decreasing the number of grant applications received. However, federal cost savings would likely be small, and staff reductions are unlikely.

7. The Congress may want to consider consolidating the four bilingual education programs into one program, which would focus on grantees with experience educating students with limited English proficiency as well as those with little experience in this area, and provide Education with the flexibility to meet the varied needs of school districts serving students with limited English proficiency.",0

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a computerized criminal justice information system that serves as a repository of data on crimes and criminals of nationwide interest and as a locator file for missing and unidentified persons. NCIC contains approximately 85,820 active records in its missing persons file.

2. The system is managed cooperatively by the FBI's CJIS Division and state and local agencies that access the system, with an Advisory Policy Board responsible for establishing policy for NCIC use by federal, state, and local agencies. The Board creates ad hoc subcommittees to review policies and develop alternatives or recommendations.

3. Local level governance of NCIC use is performed by the Criminal Justice Agency (CSA), which is responsible for the administration and usage of NCIC, including providing quality assurance and training and ensuring law enforcement agency (LEA) compliance with operating procedures. The CSA may be a law enforcement agency that also enters data into NCIC.

4. The CJIS Audit Unit conducts triennial audits of each CSA to assess compliance with NCIC policies, including the 2-hour entry requirement for reports of missing children. The audit program tasks the CJIS Audit Unit with conducting a compliance audit of each CSA to verify compliance with federal laws and CJIS policies and regulations.

5. During its audits, CJIS assesses the extent to which CSAs are fulfilling the requirement to audit all LEAs that enter data into NCIC under their jurisdiction. However, the Board has not taken steps to establish audit standards that require CSAs to assess compliance with the 2-hour entry requirement.

6. CJIS has taken steps to help ensure that LEAs implement the 2-hour entry requirement, including informing CSAs and LEAs that the Adam Walsh Act of 2006 required all reports of missing persons under the age of 21 to be entered into NCIC within 2 hours of receipt. CJIS also provided guidance to CSAs and LEAs on how to document compliance with the requirement.

1. The report examines the factors that affect the risk of injury in automobile crashes, including crash type, crash severity, automobile size and weight, safety belt use, and driver age and gender. The study focuses on the safety of automobile occupants and the dangers that automobiles pose to occupants of other vehicles. The analysis is based on data from the National Accident Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS) for 1988-1991.

2. The study finds that one-car crashes are more dangerous than multivehicle collisions, and single-car rollover crashes are particularly deadly, accounting for about 20% of occupant fatalities. The risk of injury to drivers is also affected by impact point, with head-on collisions being the most dangerous. High impact speeds are also more dangerous than low impact speeds.

3. The study finds that heavier and larger cars are more crashworthy and aggressive than lighter and smaller cars, but the protective effect of automobile size and weight varies by crash type. In one-car nonrollover crashes and collisions with other cars or light trucks, increasing weight and wheelbase reduces the risk of driver injury. However, in one-car rollover crashes, drivers of heavier cars are more likely to be hospitalized or killed.

4. The study finds that safety belts greatly reduce the risk of injury and death in roadway crashes, with manual lap and shoulder belts being the most effective. The effectiveness of safety belts varies by crash type, with belts being most effective in rollover crashes and least effective in left-side impacts. Safety belts are also more effective in one-car crashes than in multivehicle collisions.

5. The study finds that the risk of driver injury is affected by the characteristics of the other vehicle involved in the crash, including its weight and body type. Heavier vehicles pose more of a risk than lighter vehicles, and vans and light trucks are more aggressive than automobiles. The study also finds that the protective effect of automobile weight is greater than its aggressive effect.

6. The study concludes that improving automobile safety requires a multifaceted approach that includes designing safer cars, encouraging safety belt use, and addressing the aggressive behavior of some drivers. The study's findings have implications for the design of future automobiles and for safety policies aimed at reducing the number of traffic fatalities. By understanding the factors that contribute to crash risk, policymakers and automakers can work to create safer roads and vehicles.",1

1. The Department of Defense's (DOD) personal property program is used to manage household goods moves for military servicemembers and DOD civilians, with the military services paying for shipment and storage-related costs from their personnel accounts. The program has remained largely unchanged for nearly 40 years, with DOD evaluating three pilot programs to test alternative approaches and address challenges.

2. The Families First program was developed to improve the quality of household goods moves, with three goals: improving service from moving companies, streamlining the claims process, and developing an integrated information management system called DPS. DOD designed Families First to rely heavily on the completion of DPS to achieve its goals.

3. DOD has taken some initial steps to implement Families First, including developing electronic billing and payment systems and a customer satisfaction survey, but faces delays and missed milestones in developing and implementing DPS. DPS development and implementation has been pushed back for more than two years from the original estimated release date.

4. The Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, which oversees the personal property program, has experienced delays and operational problems with the electronic billing and payment systems, and the customer satisfaction survey response rate has been low. DOD has developed a methodology to make moving companies' scores statistically valid despite the low response rate.

5. DOD has developed a backup plan to provide full replacement value coverage to servicemembers by March 1, 2008, but this plan relies on a legacy system that is no longer fully supportable and does not meet security standards. The backup plan does not address other goals or benefits of Families First, such as streamlined claims or improved quality of service from moving companies.

6. The Families First program could increase costs to DOD by about $1.4 billion over current program costs through fiscal year 2011, with DOD estimating a 13% increase in costs to the services for their household goods budgets. The actual cost of Families First will not be known until moving companies file the rates they will charge DOD to move servicemembers.

7. DOD's estimated costs for developing DPS have significantly increased since the initial estimate, from $4 million to $6 million to $180 million through fiscal year 2011. The cost increase is due to the need for more new software development than expected and the establishment of a separate program office to manage the development and operation of DPS.

2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluates the health risks of pesticides used on tobacco, including the potential for harm to workers, the general population, and smokers, and sets limits on their use to mitigate these risks.
3. EPA's health risk assessments have identified potential adverse health effects associated with the use of certain pesticides on tobacco, including cancer, birth defects, and neurological damage, and have led to restrictions on their use or cancellation of their registration.
4. Despite these risks, EPA has concluded that the residues of pesticides on tobacco do not pose a significant health risk to smokers, as the levels of residues are generally below the agency's level of concern and the risks are dwarfed by the health risks associated with smoking itself.
5. EPA's assessments of the health risks of pesticides used on tobacco are based on a tiered approach, which considers the levels of residues on the crop, the toxicity of the pesticides, and the potential for exposure, and uses conservative assumptions to ensure that the risks are not underestimated.",1

2. Agencies often budget and allocate resources incrementally, based on historical precedents, rather than conducting bottom-up reviews and allocating resources based on broader goals and objectives. This approach can lead to duplication of effort and costs.

3. Individual program and funding decisions may undercut sound policies, and congressional directions may require agencies to buy items and provide services that were not planned for and may not be needed. This can lead to waste and mismanagement.

Agencies need to set and communicate realistic system requirements, maintain stability in those requirements, and ensure that programs proceed through the acquisition process based on having requisite knowledge. However, programs often experience requirements instability, causing cost escalation, schedule delays, and fewer end items.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) sets a standard price for fuel each year, which is used to charge its customers, including the military services. The standard price is based on three components: crude oil, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) sets the standard price annually based on forecasts from the Council of Economic Advisors, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

2. DOD's actual fuel costs have differed significantly from its estimated costs in recent years, with differences ranging from $2 billion to $3 billion per year. The differences are primarily due to fluctuations in fuel market prices and differences between estimated and actual fuel consumption. These differences have resulted in net outlays from the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, which is used to purchase bulk fuel.

3. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund is intended to absorb minor fuel price fluctuations, but it has been insufficient to absorb the significant net outlays for fuel. As a result, DOD has had to transfer funds into the fund from other accounts or adjust the standard price, which can disrupt other DOD programs and strain the military services' budgets. The fund's cash balance has fluctuated significantly over the years, with transfers in and out of the fund.

4. DOD has studied various aspects of its bulk fuel program since 2004, but it has not updated its approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions. The studies have identified alternatives for managing working capital funds, including transferring expiring unobligated balances into the fund and accumulating and reserving funds in times of positive cash flow. However, these alternatives have not been implemented.

5. DOD's approach for establishing the standard price does not reflect current market conditions, including the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices. The department uses the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil benchmark, which has diverged from other crude oil pricing benchmarks, such as Brent. DOD has not documented its rationale for continuing to use WTI as its baseline assumption.

6. DOD's refinement markup component of the standard price has been increased to account for the divergence between WTI and other crude oil pricing benchmarks. However, this practice adds further risk and uncertainty to the estimate, as it must now account for additional price variables.

The IRS processed 113.4 million individual income tax returns, which was 1.1 million short of its revised projection. The number of returns filed electronically and through TeleFile increased, while the number of 1040PC returns declined. The IRS also expanded its TeleFile system to seven states.

2. The IRS' computer systems generally performed well during the filing season, with some intermittent problems causing minor delays. The systems were unavailable to IRS personnel for short periods, and one problem caused a one-week delay in processing refunds. The IRS tested the use of lockboxes to improve check processing and deposit tax receipts more timely. The service centers processed and deposited more tax payment revenues than in the previous year.

3. The IRS measures refund accuracy and timeliness by reviewing samples of nonelectronically filed returns with a refund due to the taxpayer. The IRS met its timeliness goal, with an average issuance time of 36 days, and exceeded its accuracy goal, with an average accuracy rate of 98.6%. The IRS also measures the accuracy of its returns processing activity using the Computer Assisted Pipeline Review (CAPR). The CAPR data showed that the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) continues to cause errors by taxpayers and tax practitioners.

4. The IRS detected 58,828 returns involving fraudulent refunds, twice as many as in the previous year. The majority of fraudulent returns involved the EIC, and the IRS has taken steps to better control filing fraud, including adding staff to its fraud detection teams and engaging the services of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The IRS has also tightened the standards for electronic return originators and will require new applicants to submit fingerprints for a criminal records check.

TennCare's ceilings on total allowable federal funding are intended to be budget neutral, a requirement for HCFA approval of all demonstration projects.

3. TennCare was implemented on January 1, 1994, and by January 1995, over 400,000 uninsured persons and almost 800,000 Medicaid-eligible persons were enrolled. The state expanded eligibility as of October 1, 1994, by allowing persons to enroll who had lost private coverage or had insurance that offered limited coverage.

4. The state achieved savings in the first year of TennCare, with expenditures of $2.7 billion, less than 1 percent over the prior year's Medicaid expenditures. The savings were attributed to lower than expected Medicaid expenditures during the first 6 months and the introduction of a capitated payment system.

5. Delays in the MCOs' implementation of information systems have severely affected the state's ability to monitor enrollee utilization, patient access, physician practice patterns, and enrollee medical outcomes for TennCare. The state has conducted other analyses that generally indicate that MCOs are in compliance with the required numbers of primary care physicians.

6. A beneficiary survey conducted for the state by the University of Tennessee in September 1994 raised concerns about access and quality of care, with 45 percent of TennCare enrollees who had previously been on Medicaid saying that the care they received under TennCare was worse than under Medicaid. The survey also provided information on MCO adherence to HCFA's access standards.

The federal response to the crisis was slow, and it was hampered by limitations in the drug detection system, including inadequate data collection and analysis. As a result, the government was unable to respond quickly and effectively to the emerging crisis.

2. In response to the crack epidemic, the federal government made changes to its drug detection mechanisms, including expanding the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the Monitoring the Future survey, and creating new mechanisms such as the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring program. These changes aimed to improve the timeliness and accuracy of drug use data and to provide better information on emerging drug trends. However, limitations in the data collection and analysis process remained.

1. The military health system has three main missions: maintaining the health of active-duty service members, maintaining readiness to treat wartime casualties, and providing care to dependents, retirees, and survivors. In 1999, the Department of Defense (DOD) spent $16 billion on healthcare, with over $1 billion going towards care for seniors. The TRICARE framework was implemented in the mid-1990s to improve access and quality while containing costs. TRICARE provides care through military treatment facilities (MTFs) and a network of civilian providers.

2. Medicare is a federally financed health insurance program that covers healthcare expenses for the elderly, some people with disabilities, and people with end-stage kidney disease. Military retirees aged 65 or older are eligible for Medicare on the same basis as civilian retirees. Medicare enrollees receive part A benefits and are eligible for optional part B benefits if they pay a monthly premium. Beneficiaries are responsible for paying a share of costs for services.

3. The Medicare+Choice option allows beneficiaries to enroll in private managed care plans and other types of health plans. Managed care plans provide all traditional Medicare benefits and often offer additional benefits, such as prescription drug coverage. Plan members generally pay less out-of-pocket than under traditional Medicare. The Medicare subvention demonstration permitted DOD to create managed care organizations that participate in the Medicare+Choice program and enroll older retirees.

4. The demonstration, known as Senior Prime, was established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 and was extended through 2001. Senior Prime enrollees receive their Medicare-covered benefits and additional TRICARE benefits, including prescription drug coverage. Enrollees must reside in one of six geographic areas covered by the demonstration, be enrolled in both Medicare part A and part B, and be eligible for military health care benefits. They must also have used an MTF before July 1, 1997, or turned 65 on or after July 1, 1997.

5. The BBA set rules for Medicare to follow in paying DOD for the demonstration. The monthly capitation rate was set at 95% of the Medicare+Choice rate, and was further adjusted to exclude certain costs. The law also required DOD to maintain its ""level of effort"" (LOE) in providing care to older retirees before Medicare could make any payment. This provision ensured that the government would not pay for the same care twice.

1. The US Department of Defense (DOD) relies on research laboratories and industry to develop new technologies, but has historically struggled to transition these technologies from the lab to real-world use. The DOD has established several programs to address this issue, including the Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and the Quick Reaction Fund. These programs aim to speed up the transition of technologies into acquisition programs and improve military operations.

2. The TTI, DACP, and Quick Reaction Fund have different focuses and management approaches, but all aim to overcome the challenges of technology transition. The DACP has a robust selection process and management mechanisms, while the TTI has a more informal approach. The Quick Reaction Fund has a less structured selection process, but is taking steps to improve its management and oversight.

3. The programs have limited performance measures to gauge project success and return on investment, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness. Developing metrics to measure the programs' impact is challenging due to the diverse range of projects and environments. However, the Foreign Comparative Testing Program has established metrics to measure its success, which could serve as a starting point for the other programs.

4. The DOD should take actions to strengthen the selection and management capabilities of the TTI, DACP, and Quick Reaction Fund, including developing data and measures to track performance and return on investment. The DOD should also implement formal feedback mechanisms, confirm technology readiness levels, and improve communication between program managers, developers, and acquirers. By doing so, the DOD can optimize its investment in these programs and improve technology transition.",1

1. The Clean Air Act, a federal law, regulates air pollution from stationary and mobile sources, and was passed in 1963 to improve and protect the nation's air quality. The act was substantially overhauled in 1970 and 1990 to set national ambient air quality standards for pollutants.

2. The 1990 amendments required EPA to establish a detailed program for attaining and maintaining national ambient air quality standards, expand and modify regulations of hazardous air pollutant emissions, and establish an acid deposition control program. The amendments also encouraged the use of market-based approaches to reduce emissions.

3. EPA set national ambient air quality standards for six principal air pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. The agency uses annual emissions estimates as an indicator of the effectiveness of its air programs.

4. Between 1970 and 2004, gross domestic product, vehicle miles traveled, energy consumption, and U.S. population grew, but total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 54 percent. Despite this progress, many Americans continue to live in communities where pollution sometimes exceeds federal air quality standards.

5. EPA identified 452 actions required to meet the objectives of Titles I, III, and IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. About half of these actions were included under Title III, which also included the largest number of requirements with statutory deadlines.

6. EPA met 256 of the 338 requirements with statutory deadlines late, with an average delay of 24 months for Title I, 25 months for Title III, and 15 months for Title IV. The agency cited factors such as stakeholder review and involvement, prioritization, and litigation as reasons for the delays.

7. As of April 2005, 45 requirements with statutory deadlines had not been met, including activities involving promulgating regulations, reviewing national ambient air quality standards, and issuing guidance documents. EPA officials attributed the delays to various factors, including the need to review a larger quantity of scientific information and competing demands on agency staff.

8. Title I of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to review and revise national ambient air quality standards every five years to ensure they are sufficiently protective of public health and welfare. The agency must also designate areas of the country that fail to meet the standards and approve state implementation plans to correct nonattainment.

1. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) established the Girls Study Group in 2004 to develop research on preventing and reducing girls' delinquency. The group's objectives included identifying effective programs, developing program models, and disseminating findings to the girls' delinquency field. The group reviewed over 1,000 documents and identified 61 programs that targeted girls' delinquency. The group assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the What Works criteria developed by the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs.

2. The Girls Study Group's methods for assessing studies were consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards. The group's efforts to involve practitioners in Study Group activities and disseminate findings were also consistent with internal control standards. OJJDP research and program officials formed the Study Group to gain an overview of the available research in the issue area. The group's review helped consolidate the research and provide information to OJJDP for determining evaluation priorities.

3. The Study Group used OJP's What Works criteria to assess the studies, which ensured that the assessment of program effectiveness was based on highly rigorous evaluation standards. However, some experts felt that the criteria created an unrealistically high standard, causing the group to overlook potentially promising programs. OJJDP officials approved the group's use of the criteria due to its methodological rigor and the goal to identify effective programs. The group's assessment of the programs was generally concurred with by the reviewers.

4. The Study Group's composition was initially imbalanced in favor of academic researchers, which led to a focus on researching theories of girls' delinquency rather than gathering actionable information for practitioners. OJJDP addressed this issue by adding a second practitioner as a member and involving two other practitioners in study group activities. The office plans to more fully involve practitioners from the beginning when organizing study groups in the future. The group plans to issue a final report on all its activities by spring 2010.

5. The Study Group found that few girls' delinquency programs had been studied, and the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs. OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs prepare for evaluations of their effectiveness. The office could better address its girls' delinquency goals by more fully developing plans for supporting such evaluations. The Study Group reported a need for additional, methodologically rigorous evaluations of girls' delinquency programs.

1. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) was established in 1991 to standardize DOD finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems. Before DFAS, each military service had its own financial management structure, leading to duplicative and inefficient operations. The creation of DFAS aimed to improve the economy and efficiency of DOD's finance and accounting operations. DFAS was formed by consolidating the large finance and accounting centers of the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency.

2. DFAS and the military services share responsibility for carrying out DOD finance and accounting activities. The Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer has no direct line of authority over financial management staff within the military services, defense agencies, and DOD field activities. The Under Secretary issues policies, instructions, and regulations relating to financial management matters and the production of financial statements. The military services have an assistant secretary for financial management who directs and manages financial management activities.

3. DFAS has a new concept of operations that involves performing most finance and accounting operations at consolidated sites rather than at local bases and installations. This has allowed DFAS to reduce the number of locations and personnel needed to perform these operations and to standardize its accounting systems and processes. The military services have retained certain functions, such as managerial accounting and customer service, to support local commanders and customers. The services have maintained some staff at most of the 332 installation-level finance offices.

4. The total budget for DOD finance and accounting activities is unknown but exceeds $2 billion. DFAS' 1996 budget was $1.64 billion, and the military services estimated their personnel costs for fiscal year 1996 at $598 million. The majority of the funds come from operations and maintenance appropriations. The military services were unable to estimate the total amount budgeted to support their finance and accounting activities.

5. DFAS is responsible for reducing the number of finance and accounting systems used throughout DOD. Since 1991, the number of DOD's reported finance and accounting systems has been reduced from 324 to 217. The military services continue to operate hundreds of feeder systems for which DFAS has no responsibility. DFAS has a migration system strategy to reduce the number of systems used in each functional area.

1. The distribution of prescription drugs involves multiple entities, including drug wholesalers, independent pharmacies, PSAOs, and third-party payers and their PBMs. These entities facilitate the flow of and payment for drugs from manufacturers to consumers. Drug wholesalers purchase bulk quantities of drugs from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies.

2. Independent pharmacies are retail pharmacies with a store-based location, often in rural and underserved areas, that dispense medications to consumers. They offer other products and services, but prescription drugs account for the majority of their sales. Independent pharmacies spend most of their time dispensing prescription drugs and providing patient-care services.

3. PSAOs represent independent pharmacies in negotiations with third-party payers or their PBMs, and provide services such as contract negotiation, communication, and help-desk services. PSAOs charge a monthly fee for a bundled set of services, and may also charge for individual services. PSAOs do not receive fees from third-party payers or their PBMs.

4. PSAOs vary in their requirements for member pharmacies, with some requiring participation in all contracts and others allowing pharmacies to choose from a portfolio of contracts. PSAOs also vary in their provision of services, with some offering central payment and reconciliation services, and others providing inventory management or front store layout assistance. PSAOs have changed their services over time to meet member pharmacies' interests.

5. PSAOs create administrative efficiencies for both independent pharmacies and third-party payers or their PBMs. PSAO services enable pharmacy staff to focus on patient-care services rather than administrative issues. PSAOs also reduce the number of resources that PBMs must direct toward developing and maintaining relationships with multiple independent pharmacies.

6. PSAOs must ensure that their arrangements do not unreasonably restrain trade, thereby raising antitrust concerns. The FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice are responsible for determining whether a particular collaborative arrangement may be unlawful. PSAOs take measures to minimize antitrust issues, such as developing their organizational structure to ensure compliance with antitrust laws.

7. PSAO owners varied as to whether they require member pharmacies to also use services from a separate non-PSAO line of their business. Wholesalers and independent pharmacy cooperatives owned the majority of PSAOs in operation in 2011 or 2012. PSAO owners may operate PSAOs for a number of reasons, including to benefit another, non-PSAO line of their business.

1. Concerns about hate crimes have become increasingly prominent among policymakers, and Congress has recognized the special concerns and effects of hate crimes by enacting several laws. A hate crime is defined as a criminal offense motivated in whole or in part by the offender's bias against a person or group based on race, religion, disability, ethnic/national origin, or sexual orientation.

2. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the scope of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability, and broadened the circumstances under which the federal government would assert jurisdiction to prosecute such crimes. However, there are questions about what underlying authority Congress may utilize to expand the scope of hate crimes.

3. The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing Congress's authority to proscribe hate crimes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation. The commerce clause authorizes Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.

4. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Morrison narrowed the ""affects interstate commerce"" category, rejecting the argument that Congress may regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. This decision suggests that attempts to broaden the scope of hate crime legislation tied to findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes under the commerce clause are constitutionally suspect.

5. Hate crimes that involve interstate travel continue to be within the commerce clause's reach, but the expansion of hate crime legislation may be within the scope of other legislative powers such as the legislative clauses of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. These amendments give Congress the power to enforce the amendments by appropriate legislation.

6. Section 2 of the 13th Amendment may be a more viable option for broadening hate crime legislation, as it proscribes slavery and involuntary servitude without reference to federal, state, or private action. The Court has observed that Congress has the power to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery and to translate that determination into effective legislation.

7. The Court has considered constitutional challenges regarding state hate crime statutes under both the 1st and 6th Amendments, which provide limits on the manner in which Congress and/or states may enact hate crime legislation. The 1st Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law abridging",0

1. The exchange rate policies of some East Asian nations, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have been a source of tension with the United States. These countries have been accused of intentionally keeping their currencies undervalued to maintain a competitive edge in global markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rules against currency manipulation, and the US Treasury Department is required to report on exchange rate policies of major trading partners. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the Treasury to identify countries that meet certain criteria, including a significant bilateral trade surplus with the US, a material current account surplus, and persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market.

2. East Asian governments have adopted various exchange rate policies, including fixed, pegged, and managed float systems. A fixed exchange rate policy involves pegging the value of the currency to another currency or a basket of currencies, while a managed float policy allows the currency to fluctuate within a certain range. Hong Kong and Brunei operate a currency board system, which effectively pegs their exchange rates. The IMF categorizes exchange rate policies, but categorization can be complicated, especially during periods of financial turbulence.

3. China's exchange rate policy has been a subject of controversy, with some accusing it of manipulating its currency to gain an unfair competitive advantage. China officially maintained a crawling peg policy prior to the global financial crisis, but the renminbi was relatively stable in value relative to the US dollar from 2008 to 2010. China's central bank announced in 2010 that it would enhance the renminbi exchange rate flexibility, and the currency has since gradually strengthened against the US dollar. However, the renminbi has weakened against the dollar since 2015.

4. Japan's yen has undergone significant fluctuations in value relative to the US dollar over the past 10 years, with some analysts attributing the changes to market confidence in Japan's economy and monetary policy. The Japanese government has denied claims that it has intervened in foreign exchange markets to lower the value of the yen. The Bank of Japan has implemented expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, which has led to a weakening of the yen. The last confirmed time Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets was in 2011.

1. The role of U.S. ambassadors, also known as Chiefs of Mission (COMs), has evolved significantly since World War II, with increased responsibilities for overseeing U.S. government activities in their host countries. COMs are responsible for directing, coordinating, and supervising all executive branch employees in their country of assignment, except for those under the command of a geographic combatant commander. The COM's authority is derived from the President's constitutional powers and is codified in the Foreign Service Act of 1980.

2. The COM's responsibilities include keeping the President and Secretary of State informed of all activities and operations in their country, ensuring that all U.S. government employees comply with COM directives, and promoting U.S. goods and services for export. The COM is also responsible for the security of all U.S. government personnel in their country, except for those under the command of a geographic combatant commander. The COM's authority extends to all executive branch agencies, including the Department of Defense.

3. The COM's authority is shaped by executive branch directives, including the President's Letter of Instruction, which sets out the COM's role and responsibilities as the President's personal representative. The Letter of Instruction is more significant in determining a COM's authority than legislative provisions. The COM's authority is also influenced by executive orders, such as Executive Order 10893, which states that COMs have affirmative responsibility for the coordination and supervision of all executive branch agencies in their country.

4. The COM's relationship with the Department of Defense (DOD) is complex, with COM authority extending to DOD personnel except those under the command of a geographic combatant commander. The COM is responsible for the security of DOD personnel in their country, and DOD personnel are subject to COM authority when performing certain functions or conducting certain activities. The COM's relationship with Special Operations Forces (SOF) depends on the activity being performed and under whose command they are operating.

1. China's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and investment flows, with exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) contributing significantly to its GDP growth. In 2007, China overtook the United States to become the world's second-largest merchandise exporter after the European Union. The foreign trade sector employs more than 80 million people, of which 28 million work in foreign-invested enterprises.

2. China's exports of goods and services as a share of GDP rose from 9.1% in 1985 to 37.8% in 2008, making it vulnerable to the global economic slowdown. The current global economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on China's export sector and industries that depend on FDI flows. China's GDP growth slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009, with a growth rate of 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 6.1% in the first quarter of 2009.

3. China's exposure to the global financial crisis is unclear, but its restrictions on capital flows limit the ability of Chinese citizens and firms to invest overseas. Chinese government entities, such as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, may have been more exposed to troubled U.S. mortgage securities. China's foreign exchange reserves rose from $403 billion in 2003 to $2.1 trillion as of June 2009.

4. A large portion of China's reserves are believed to be invested in overseas assets, including U.S. securities, such as long-term Treasury debt, agency debt, corporate debt, and equities. China's holdings of U.S. securities totaled $1,205 billion as of June 2008, making it the second-largest foreign holder of such securities. If China held troubled sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, they would likely be included in the corporate securities category.

5. China's economy has not been immune to the effects of the global financial crisis, with numerous sectors being hard hit, including the real estate market, stock market, and trade and FDI flows. The value of China's main stock market index lost nearly two-thirds of its value from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2008. Exports and imports from January-July 2009 were down 22.0% and 23.6%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.

The policy also aims to ensure the orderly and economic development of domestic mineral resources, reserves, and reclamation of metals and minerals to meet industrial, security, and environmental needs.

2. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages most federal mineral development and is responsible for implementing the national mining and minerals policy. The Forest Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also plays a role in authorizing mineral development on National Forest System lands.

3. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease oil and gas deposits and onshore public domain lands containing oil and gas deposits, with the federal government retaining title to the lands. The leasing authority applies to National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain and to most reserved subsurface mineral estates.

4. The BLM manages approximately 262 million acres of public lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The Secretary of the Interior must develop and revise land use plans, known as Resource Management Plans, which consider the present and potential future uses for public lands managed by BLM.

5. The competitive and noncompetitive leasing processes are used to lease public lands for oil and gas development. Competitive leasing involves auctioning off leases to the highest bidder, while noncompetitive leasing allows the first qualified applicant to lease the land without bidding.

6. Leases are conditioned upon payment of a royalty of at least 12.5% in amount or value of oil or gas production that is removed or sold from the leased land. The Secretary of the Interior also has the power to reduce the royalty on a noncompetitive lease if it is deemed equitable to do so or if circumstances could cause undue hardship or premature termination of production.

1. The report analyzes data on itemized tax deductions to inform discussions on reforming or limiting them, which could increase federal tax revenue, increase the share of taxes paid by higher-income tax filers, simplify the tax code, or reduce incentives that might lead to inefficient economic behavior. In 2014, 30% of all tax filers chose to itemize their deductions, with higher-income individuals more likely to itemize and claim larger deductions. The majority of itemizers (56.2%) had incomes less than $100,000, and 86.8% had an AGI less than $200,000.

2. Specific itemized deductions tend to benefit different types of itemizers based on their income, and the structure of certain provisions (e.g., floors or ceilings) can limit claims. Tax filers in higher-income ranges claimed deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes at higher rates than those in lower-income ranges. The deduction for charitable gifts was claimed by 37% of tax filers with an AGI between $50,000 and $100,000, and over 86% of tax filers in each of the income ranges over $200,000.

3. The distribution of specific deductions as a share of all itemized deductions varies across income classes, with the home mortgage interest deduction comprising the largest share of total itemized deductions for itemizers with an AGI between $20,000 and $200,000. The deduction for state and local income taxes comprised the largest share of total itemized deductions for itemizers with an AGI greater than $200,000. The deductions for state and local income taxes and charitable contributions composed a larger share of total deductions claimed as income rises.

4. Proposals to reform or limit itemized deductions include a flat, dollar-value cap or percentage-of-income cap on total deductions, a limit on the tax rate at which deductions can be valued, converting deductions into credits, and others. Efforts to target limits on itemized tax deductions toward higher-income tax filers are restricted in the amount of revenue that can be raised. A reduction in the tax benefit derived from activities eligible for tax deduction can affect tax filer behavior, and the form of a limit on itemized deductions might affect which deductions a tax filer might claim.",1

The United States has economic interests in the region, particularly in fishing, and provides foreign assistance to Pacific Island countries. The region is also vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels and natural disasters posing significant threats.

2. The United States has a range of policy objectives in the region, including promoting sustainable economic development, addressing the effects of climate change, and strengthening regional organizations. The country also seeks to project a presence in the region, cooperate with Australia and other regional aid donors, and support the U.S. tuna fleet. The U.S. government administers foreign assistance to Pacific Island countries through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Office for the Pacific Islands. USAID has partnered with Pacific Islands regional organizations to carry out a five-year program to coordinate responses to the adverse impacts of climate change.

3. The Compacts of Free Association govern U.S. diplomatic, economic, and military relations with the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. The Compacts provide for U.S. economic commitments to the Freely Associated States, which depend heavily on U.S. support. The United States is obligated to defend the Freely Associated States against attack or threat of attack, and has the prerogative to reject the strategic use of, or military access to, the FAS by third countries. The Freely Associated States and their citizens are eligible for various U.S. federal programs and services.

4. China's growing influence in the region is a concern for the United States, with Beijing becoming a major source of foreign assistance, trade, and investment in the Southwest Pacific. China's engagement in the region has been motivated largely by a desire to garner support in international fora and find sources of raw materials. While the United States does not maintain an embassy in several Pacific Islands countries, China has opened diplomatic missions in all eight of the Pacific Island countries with which it has diplomatic relations. China's foreign assistance to the Southwest Pacific has resulted in 218 projects since 2006, including Chinese-built roads, sea ports, airports, and other public works.",1

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of species that are endangered or threatened with extinction, and federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine whether an agency project might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species. The consultation process concludes with the appropriate Service issuing a biological opinion (BiOp) as to the harm the project poses. If a project could jeopardize a species, a jeopardy opinion is released along with any reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to the agency action that would avoid jeopardy.

2. The exemption process is available when a federal action cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, and the federal agency believes that the RPAs would thwart the project. The exemption process offers the opportunity to consider extraordinary economic circumstances in the list of factors used in evaluating federal actions, and provides an opportunity for economic factors to override jeopardy to the species. However, an exemption is for a federal project, license, or action, rather than for a species—a key distinction.

3. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) reviews applications for exemptions, and is responsible for the ultimate decision. The ESC is composed of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Army, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and one individual from each affected state. The ESC may conduct additional fact-finding, including hosting oral presentations, and has subpoena powers for obtaining information it deems necessary to reach its decision.

4. The exemption process is a complex and lengthy process that can take up to 280 days, and even if an exemption is granted, controversy and legal challenges may continue. Other laws may still be in play, and conflicts may remain. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall more heavily on any other areas that the species inhabits or on other resources that the species requires.

5. There have been only six instances in which an exemption was sought, and only two in which it was granted, since the ESA was enacted in 1973. The exemption process is rarely invoked, likely due to the stringency of the process, the need for the applicant to fund potentially costly permanent mitigation, and the fact that after an exemption is granted, the burden of conservation may fall more heavily on any other areas that the species inhabits or on other resources that the species requires.",0

1. The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has undergone significant changes since 1913, with various legislative changes aimed at achieving symmetry between the two. The current system allows net long-term losses to be deducted against net short-term gains without limit, but only up to $3,000 of ordinary income. This creates an asymmetry, as net long-term gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%, while net long-term losses can be deducted against short-term gains taxed at up to 35%. The loss limitation was introduced to prevent taxpayers from manipulating the system by realizing losses and not gains.

2. Increasing the net capital loss limit may not be an effective way to stimulate the economy, as it could lead to a short-term incentive to sell stocks, depressing prices and eroding confidence. The benefits of an increased limit would primarily go to higher-income individuals, who tend to have a higher propensity to save rather than spend. Restoring the value of the loss limitation to its 1978 level would require addressing the growing asymmetry between the tax treatment of gains and losses. Achieving full symmetry would require adjusting the netting process to account for the rate differential between short-term and long-term gains and losses.",1

1. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) recognizes the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing, and encourages the practice and procedure of collective bargaining to mitigate labor-related obstructions to the free flow of commerce. The Act does not apply to all individuals employed by an employer, but only to ""employees,"" excluding individuals employed as supervisors. Section 2(3) of the NLRA defines an employee as any individual employed by an employer, excluding supervisors.

2. The term ""supervisor"" is defined by the Act to include any individual with the authority to perform any one of 12 specified functions, if the exercise of such authority requires the use of independent judgment and is not merely routine or clerical. The NLRB and U.S. Supreme Court have sought to provide meaning to this language, including in the case of NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc. The Court understood section 2(11) of the NLRA to set forth a three-part test for determining supervisory status.

3. In Kentucky River, the Court recognized the NLRB's discretion to clarify the meaning of the term ""independent judgment,"" but maintained that it was inappropriate for the NLRB to characterize judgment that reflects ""ordinary professional or technical judgment"" as failing to be independent judgment. The Court believed that the NLRB's reference to ""ordinary or technical judgment"" established a ""startling categorical exclusion"" that was not suggested by the NLRA's statutory text. The Court observed that most supervisory judgments rely on professional or technical skill or experience.

4. In 2006, the NLRB revisited the issue of supervisory status in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., where it defined the terms ""assign,"" ""responsibly to direct,"" and ""independent judgment"" as they are used in section 2(11) of the NLRA. The NLRB concluded that the term ""assign"" should be construed to refer to the act of designating an employee to a place, appointing an employee to a time, or giving significant overall duties or tasks to an employee. The term ""responsibly to direct"" applies to individuals who not only oversee the work being performed but are held responsible if the work is done poorly or not at all.

5. The NLRB maintained that to establish accountability for purposes of responsible direction, it must be shown that the employer delegated to the putative supervisor the authority to direct the work and the authority to take corrective action",0

ASEAN's members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The organization has a combined population of 580 million and a GDP of $1.5 trillion.

2. The United States has been seeking to expand and upgrade its relations with ASEAN, recognizing the region's strategic importance and economic potential. The Obama Administration has taken steps to engage with ASEAN, including appointing an ambassador to the organization and participating in the East Asia Summit. The US-ASEAN relationship is seen as crucial in promoting regional stability and security.

3. ASEAN has been playing a key role in promoting regional security and stability, particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and conflict prevention. The organization has also been actively engaged in promoting economic integration and cooperation, including the establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). ASEAN has also been seeking to strengthen its relations with other regional organizations, such as the European Union and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.

4. The ASEAN region is strategically located, with several member states bordering the South China Sea, which is a critical shipping lane for global trade. The region is also rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals. ASEAN's economic growth and development have been driven by its strategic location, natural resources, and human capital.

5. ASEAN has been seeking to promote greater economic integration and cooperation among its member states, with the goal of creating a single market and production base by 2015. The organization has also been actively engaged in negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, and India. ASEAN's economic integration efforts are seen as crucial in promoting regional economic growth and competitiveness.

1. The ""state sponsors of terrorism list"" is mandated under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, which requires the Secretary of State to designate countries that have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
2. Cuba has been on the list since 1982, and currently, there are four other countries on the list: Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
3. Being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism restricts trade benefits, foreign aid, and bilateral assistance, and requires validated licenses for exports of virtually all items to these countries.
4. Cuba's retention on the terrorism list has received more attention in recent years due to increased support for legislative initiatives to lift some U.S. economic sanctions under the current embargo.
5. The addition of Cuba to the list in 1982 was due to its support for terrorist groups in Latin America, including the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia.
6. The State Department has reported that Cuba continues to provide safe haven to members of several Foreign Terrorist Organizations and U.S. fugitives from justice, and has not undertaken any counterterrorism efforts in international and regional fora.
7. There is some dispute about the existence and extent of Cuba's offensive biological weapons program, with some allegations dating back to 2002, but the issue remains controversial.

1. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation that adds back certain deductions and exemptions, and is phased out for higher-income individuals. The AMT base is broader than the regular tax base, but excludes certain benefits like lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds.

2. The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has increased over time due to inflation, and is projected to continue growing, with over 9 million taxpayers expected to pay the AMT in 2009. This growth is largely due to the fact that AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation.

3. The AMT interacts with tax cuts in complex ways, potentially limiting their benefits for certain taxpayers, particularly those with higher incomes or those who claim certain credits. For example, the marriage penalty relief provisions in H.R. 1836 would have been limited by the AMT for many taxpayers.

4. The cost of correcting the AMT is significant, with estimates suggesting that indexing AMT exemptions would cost $13.9 billion by 2008, and eliminating the credit limit provision would cost $26 billion by 2009. These costs would be even higher in the wake of recent tax changes.

5. There are different approaches to dealing with the AMT, including making it a more comprehensive alternative tax, limiting its scope, or eliminating it altogether. Any approach would need to consider the complexities of the AMT and its interactions with the regular tax system.",0

1. The United States and India have a growing partnership, but India's relations with Iran could be a significant obstacle to further development of U.S.-India ties. India and Iran have a long history of positive relations, and India has never shared the U.S. assessment of Iran as an aggressive regional power. India's leaders speak of ""civilizational ties"" between the two countries, referencing interactions between Persian and Indus Valley civilizations over millennia.

2. India-Iran relations have not evolved into a strategic alliance, and are unlikely to derail the further development of a U.S.-India global partnership. India is unlikely to abandon its relationship with Iran or accept external dictation on the topic. India's interest in maintaining positive ties with Iran, especially in energy commerce, is clear.

3. Many in Congress voice concern about India's relations with Iran and their relevance to U.S. interests. Some worry about New Delhi's defense relations with Tehran and have sought to link this with congressional approval of U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation. There are also concerns that India plans to seek energy resources from Iran, thus financially benefiting a country the United States seeks to isolate.

4. Indian firms have taken long-term contracts for purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports the proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan. The Bush Administration expresses strong opposition to any pipeline projects involving Iran, but top Indian officials insist the project is in India's national interest. Some analysts believe geostrategic motives beyond energy security drive India's pursuit of closer relations with Iran.

5. India's relations with Iran are underlined by historical, civilizational, and multifaceted ties, with bilateral cooperation flourishing in fields such as energy, trade, and commerce. Iranian leaders reciprocate New Delhi's favorable view and insist that warming U.S.-India relations will not weaken their own ties with New Delhi. However, there are signs that India intends to bring its Iran policy into closer alignment with that of the United States.

1. The federal government has supported energy storage and electric power system technology programs since the 1970s, initially focusing on energy storage and later expanding to include grid modernization and cybersecurity. The advancement of computer capacity, miniaturization, and industrial controls has improved grid operators' ability to monitor and control electric power flows. However, the increased use of internet-connected devices has introduced new cybersecurity challenges. The energy sector consists of thousands of dispersed assets, making coordination and security a complex task.

2. The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is responsible for supporting a more economically competitive, environmentally responsible, secure, and resilient U.S. energy infrastructure. OE's mission is guided by the Quadrennial Technology Review and the Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan. The office works with various stakeholders, including private industry and federal, state, local, and tribal governments, to modernize the electric grid. OE's goal is to deliver reliable, affordable, and clean electricity to consumers.

3. OE's programs are aligned with the Obama Administration's priorities, including the ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy and increasing electric grid resilience. The office received a significant funding boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was used to deploy smart grid technologies. Since 2005, the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill has funded all DOE programs, including OE. The office mainly conducts R&D, often in partnership with industry.

1. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was enacted in 1986 to guide the creation of memorials in the District of Columbia. The act aimed to preserve the integrity of the comprehensive design of the L'Enfant and McMillan plans for the Nation's Capital. The CWA defined a commemorative work as a statue, monument, sculpture, memorial, plaque, inscription, or other structure designed to perpetuate a memory.

2. The CWA established the National Capital Memorial Commission to review and approve memorial proposals. The commission ensures that memorials are of lasting national significance and meet certain design and location standards. The commission also provides guidance to sponsors on the memorial creation process.

3. The CWA divides the District of Columbia and its environs into three sections for memorial placement: the Reserve, Area I, and Area II. The Reserve is a no-build zone, and Area I is reserved for memorials of preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States. Area II is for memorials of lasting historical significance to the American people.

4. To establish a memorial, a sponsor must find a congressional sponsor to introduce authorizing legislation. The legislation must be approved by Congress, and the sponsor must comply with the CWA's requirements. The National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission offers consultative services to potential sponsors.

5. The CWA requires that no commemorative work may be established in the District of Columbia unless specifically authorized by Congress. The act also specifies requirements for military works and works commemorating events, individuals, or groups. For military works, the CWA requires Congress to consider legislation only for the commemoration of a war or similar major military conflict or a branch of the armed forces.

6. For works commemorating events, individuals, or groups, the CWA specifies that Congress will not consider legislation until after the 25th anniversary of the event, death of the individual, or death of the last surviving member of the group. Legislation authorizing a commemorative work typically contains three sections: authorization to establish the work, payment of expenses, and deposit of excess funds.

7. Once authorized, additional legislation is required to designate a commemorative work in Area I. The National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission and the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General Services recommend the location of a commemorative work in either Area I or Area II. If the Secretary or Administrator agrees with the recommendation, he or she will recommend placement in Area I and notify Congress of his or her determination.

1. High risk health insurance pools are designed to provide health coverage to individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market due to preexisting health conditions. These pools target individuals who have sought health coverage in the individual market but have been denied coverage, received quotes with higher premiums, or received offers with exclusions for preexisting conditions. Many states use high risk pools to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Currently, 35 states have high risk health insurance pools.

2. High risk pools enroll a small percentage of the uninsured, with approximately 200,000 individuals enrolled in 34 high risk pools in 2008, despite an estimated 4 million potentially eligible individuals. The limited enrollment reflects the narrow focus of these pools on individuals with preexisting health conditions who do not have access to public or group health insurance and seek coverage in the private market. High risk pools appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion and reliance on current state oversight of health insurance. Supporters argue that states can use their existing regulatory infrastructure to efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals.

3. High risk pools operate at a loss because it is not feasible to pool individuals with major health problems and expect their premium contributions to cover the entire cost. To limit premiums, states cap high risk pool premiums, usually between 150% and 200% of standard risk rates. States may augment premium collection with assessments on insurers, general revenue, and other state sources. Many state HRPs also receive grants from the federal government.

4. State high risk pools have a great deal of discretion regarding establishment and operation, including covered benefits, eligibility requirements, pre-existing condition exclusion periods, and funding sources. States establish the eligibility criteria for high risk pools, and many allow HIPAA-eligible persons to enroll. High risk pools also address the insurance needs of non-HIPAA-eligible persons with costly medical conditions. Some states provide for presumptive eligibility, allowing individuals to become automatically eligible for HRPs if they have a certain medical condition specified under state law.

5. The federal government has provided financial assistance to states through a grant program, administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), to support the creation and implementation of high risk pools. Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for seed grants, operational grants, and bonus grants to states. The grants are distributed according to existing statutory requirements.

The program was created in 1951 and is managed by the Departments of Defense and Transportation. The CRAF has been activated twice, during Operations Desert Shield/Storm and Iraqi Freedom, and has provided significant airlift capacity to support military operations.

2. The CRAF program has several benefits, including providing a cost-effective way to augment military airlift capacity, allowing for the use of commercial aircraft that are better suited for certain types of cargo, and providing an incentive for commercial airlines to invest in aircraft that can be used for military purposes. The program also provides a way for the government to tap into the expertise and resources of the commercial airline industry. However, the program also has some limitations, including the fact that commercial aircraft may not be as capable as military aircraft in certain situations.

3. The CRAF program has undergone several changes and updates over the years, including the addition of new aircraft and the development of new policies and procedures. The program has also been the subject of several studies and reports, including a 2008 study that examined the viability of the program and made recommendations for its future.

1. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a comprehensive energy legislation that aims to promote energy independence, improve energy efficiency, and enhance energy security. It includes provisions related to electricity reliability, transmission infrastructure, and market transparency. The act also repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and amends the Federal Power Act. The legislation is divided into several subtitles, each addressing a specific aspect of the energy sector.

2. The Electricity Reliability subtitle establishes the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to oversee and enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system. The ERO is responsible for developing and enforcing standards, and FERC has the authority to approve or remand these standards. The subtitle also provides for the creation of a regional advisory body and allows for the participation of states in the development of reliability standards. The provision does not apply to Alaska and Hawaii.

3. The Transmission Infrastructure subtitle aims to improve the transmission infrastructure by providing incentives for the development of new transmission facilities. It allows the Secretary of Energy to designate national interest electric transmission corridors and authorizes the use of eminent domain to acquire rights-of-way for transmission facilities. The subtitle also establishes a program to provide incentives for the development of advanced transmission technologies. FERC is directed to issue rules to promote the development of transmission infrastructure.

4. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is repealed, and a new regulatory framework is established for holding companies. The new framework gives FERC authority over holding companies and their affiliates, and requires them to make their books and records available to FERC. The framework also provides for state access to books and records and exempts certain transactions from FERC's jurisdiction. FERC is directed to promulgate rules to implement the new framework.

5. The Market Transparency subtitle aims to promote price transparency in wholesale electric markets. FERC is directed to facilitate price transparency and may prescribe rules to provide information about the availability and prices of wholesale electric energy and transmission services. The subtitle also prohibits false statements and market manipulation, and increases criminal and civil penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act.",0

1. The Robinson-Patman Act was enacted in 1936 to create a market atmosphere where small businesses could compete effectively with larger rivals. The act prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality."" It applies only to the sale of goods and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the United States. The act does not apply to the sale of services or goods sold for export.

2. The Department of Justice has been less than enthusiastic about the Robinson-Patman Act, believing it is not beneficial to consumers. The Antitrust Division has noted that the act has many adverse effects on the economy. The act's benefits are debated, with some arguing it helps small businesses and prevents increased concentration in a line of commerce. However, the act's burdens on American economic activity must be considered.

3. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcing the Robinson-Patman Act, but has acted inconsistently over the years. Most cases have been brought by disfavored buyers. Defenses to Robinson-Patman allegations include commodities not being of ""like grade and quality,"" sales for export, meeting competition, cost justification, and the nonprofit exemption. The meeting competition defense has two levels: primary line competition and secondary line competition.

4. The nonprofit exemption was created by the 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act, which permits price breaks on purchases of supplies for their own use by certain institutions. The exemption is intended to allow institutions to operate as inexpensively as possible. The Supreme Court has interpreted the exemption strictly, limiting it to purchases made to meet the needs of the institution and its staff. The exemption does not apply to purchases made for resale or for use in retail competition with private enterprise.

5. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have been found to be eligible institutions under the Nonprofit Institutions Act. The courts have relied on the ""for their own use"" criterion to decide that drugs purchased by an HMO for resale to its members are purchased for the HMO's ""own use."" This interpretation has been endorsed by the United States District Court for Northern Illinois. The inclusion of HMOs in the list of entities entitled to the nonprofit exemption has not been judicially repudiated.

6. If a defendant cannot justify a price differential, and the nonprofit exemption is unavailable, price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act is proved. However, the successful plaintiff is not automatically entitled to damages in the amount of the unlawful price",0

1. The Obama Administration has faced scrutiny for its nonenforcement, under-enforcement, or delayed enforcement of certain federal laws, citing prosecutorial discretion and administrative enforcement discretion as justification. The Administration's actions have been met with opposition from some Members of Congress, who argue that these actions violate the President's constitutional obligation to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.""

2. The Take Care Clause of the Constitution imposes a duty on the President to ensure that executive branch officials obey Congress's commands, and does not provide the President with the authority to frustrate legal requirements imposed by law. The Clause has been interpreted as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and enforce the law.

3. The Supreme Court has established that the President must retain some level of control over those that enforce the law, and that Congress cannot provide itself with the power to appoint members of an independent commission that has been vested with enforcement powers. The Court has also suggested that vesting state and local officers with the authority to enforce federal law may intrude upon the President's duty to oversee those that execute the law.

4. The doctrine of prosecutorial discretion has a long historical pedigree, and is rooted in the constitutional structure of the United States. Courts generally will not review discretionary prosecutorial decisions in criminal matters, nor coerce the executive branch to initiate a particular prosecution.

5. The executive branch has asserted that it must maintain absolute control over prosecutorial decisions, and that neither the Judicial nor Legislative Branches may directly interfere with the prosecutorial discretion of the Executive. However, the government cannot cloak constitutional violations under the guise of prosecutorial discretion and expect the federal courts to ignore them.

6. Courts may review prosecutorial decisions for compliance with express statutory requirements, and may also choose to review decisions that violate individual constitutional rights. However, defendants generally find it difficult to maintain a claim of selective prosecution, and courts require clear evidence displacing the presumption that the prosecutor has acted lawfully.

7. Agency civil enforcement decisions in the administrative context share some characteristics with prosecutorial discretion in the criminal context. Courts generally will not review discretionary agency enforcement decisions, as they are ""committed to agency discretion by law"" under the Administrative Procedure Act.

8. The Supreme Court has established that an agency's decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from judicial review, unless the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers, or the agency has ""consciously and expressly adopted a general policy"" that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication",0

1. The official U.S. poverty rate in 2013 was 14.5%, a statistically significant drop from 15.0% in 2012, marking the first decline since 2006. The poverty rate tends to follow the economic cycle, rising during recessions and falling during periods of economic growth. In 2013, 45.3 million people were estimated to be living in poverty, a number statistically unchanged from 2012. The poverty rate is highest among certain groups, including minorities, women and children, the very old, the unemployed, and those with low levels of educational attainment.

2. The poverty rate among children dropped significantly from 2012 to 2013, from 21.3% to 19.5%, with 1.3 million fewer children living in poverty. Children living in single female-headed families are especially prone to poverty, with 45.8% of them living in poverty in 2013. The increased share of children living in single female-headed families has contributed to the high overall child poverty rate. In 2013, nearly 6 in 10 poor children lived in single female-headed families.

3. Adults with low education, those who are unemployed, or those who have a work-related disability are especially prone to poverty. Among 25- to 34-year-olds without a high school diploma, 36.8% were poor in 2013. In contrast, only 6.5% of 25- to 34-year-olds with at least a bachelor's degree were poor. Among persons between the ages of 16 and 64 who were unemployed in March 2014, nearly 3 out of 10 were poor based on their families' incomes in 2013.

4. Poverty is more highly concentrated in some areas than in others, with poverty rates about twice as high in center cities as in suburban areas and nearly three times as high in the poorest states as in the least poor states. Within metropolitan areas, poverty rates are highest in center city areas, with poverty rates dropping off in suburban areas, and then rising with increasing distance from an urban core. In 2013, only nonmetropolitan areas experienced a statistically significant decline in poverty from 2012.

1. The United States plays a significant role in global agricultural markets, and its farm policy is subject to scrutiny under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) sets country-specific spending limits on trade-distorting policies, and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) governs domestic support policies that may distort international markets. The AoA categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs based on their potential to distort commercial markets.

2. The AoA uses a traffic light analogy to group programs, with green box programs being minimally or non-trade distorting, blue box programs being production-limiting, and amber box programs being the most market-distorting. The United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays, with certain de minimis exemptions. The AoA procedures for classifying and counting trade-distorting support are complex, but four questions can be asked to determine whether a particular farm measure will cause total U.S. domestic support to exceed the $19.1 billion limit.

3. To qualify for exemption in the green box, a program must meet two general criteria and specific criteria relative to the type of agriculture-related program. Green box programs include research, pest and disease control, training, and marketing and promotion services, among others. No limits are placed on green box spending, as it is considered minimally or non-trade distorting.

4. Blue box programs are production-limiting and receive a special exemption, with no limits placed on blue box spending. To qualify for exemption in the blue box, a program must be a direct payment under a production-limiting program, and must also meet certain conditions. The United States has not notified any payments under the blue box since 1995.

5. Amber box policies are subject to a strict aggregate, annual spending limit, and the United States is subject to a spending limit of $19.1 billion in amber box outlays. De minimis exemptions are domestic support spending that is sufficiently small to be deemed benign, with product-specific and non-product-specific de minimis exclusions. The SCM evaluates the market distortion of a program or policy in terms of its measurable market effects on international trade and/or market price for the affected commodity.

1. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs are collectively referred to as the ""campus-based"" programs, which are authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. These programs are considered campus-based because federal funds are awarded directly to institutions of higher education, which administer the programs and provide institutional funds to match the federal funds they receive.

2. The campus-based programs are unique in that the mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined according to institution-specific award criteria, rather than according to non-discretionary award criteria. The programs' authorizations of appropriations, along with many other provisions under the HEA, expired at the end of FY2015.

3. The FSEOG and FWS programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriation bills, while the Perkins Loan program was amended and extended through FY2017 under the Federal Perkins Loan Program Extension Act of 2015. The campus-based programs are among the oldest of the federal financial aid programs.

4. The Perkins Loan program was originally enacted under Title II of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and was established in part as a response to the space-race between the United States and the Soviet Union and concerns over national security. The program authorized participating institutions to award low-interest rate loans to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who were enrolled full-time and who demonstrated financial need.

5. The FWS program was originally authorized as the College Work Study program under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, and was incorporated into the HEA in 1968. The purpose of the program as originally enacted was to stimulate and promote the part-time employment of students in institutions of higher education who were from low-income families.

6. The FSEOG program was authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and was extended and renamed as the FSEOG program under the Higher Education Amendments of 1972. The purpose of the program was to assist students with exceptional financial need in attending institutions of higher education.

7. Funds for each of the campus-based programs are allocated to institutions through a two-stage process, with a base guarantee and a fair share allocation. The base guarantee is determined based on the year an institution began participating in each of the campus-based programs, and the fair share is allocated according to formula-based procedures.

1. The September 11 attacks highlighted the vulnerability of the US water infrastructure to terrorist attacks, which could disrupt public health and the environment. The water infrastructure sector is large and diverse, comprising surface and ground water sources, treatment facilities, and distribution systems. The sector is critical to public health, economy, and national security. The federal government has a role in protecting the sector, but most of the infrastructure is owned and operated by non-federal entities.

2. The water infrastructure sector is vulnerable to various types of attacks, including physical disruption, bioterrorism, and cyber attacks. The sector's vulnerability is exacerbated by its interconnectedness with other critical infrastructure, such as electric power and transportation. The consequences of an attack on the water sector could be severe, including loss of life, economic disruption, and environmental damage. The sector's vulnerability has been recognized for decades, but the 9/11 attacks heightened awareness of the need for improved security.

3. The federal government has taken steps to improve the security of the water infrastructure sector, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Water Security Division. DHS is responsible for coordinating national efforts to protect critical infrastructure, including the water sector. EPA provides guidance and technical assistance to water utilities to help them assess and mitigate vulnerabilities. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers also play key roles in protecting federal water infrastructure.

4. Water utilities have taken steps to improve their security, including conducting vulnerability assessments, implementing security measures, and participating in information-sharing networks. The Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC) is a key mechanism for sharing security-related information among water utilities. The Water Security Channel (WaterSC) is another information-sharing platform that provides security-related information to water utilities. EPA and DHS also provide security-related guidance and information to water utilities.

5. The water sector faces challenges in implementing security measures, including limited resources, lack of standardization, and the need for coordination among multiple stakeholders. The sector also faces challenges in balancing security with other priorities, such as public health and environmental protection. The cost of implementing security measures is a significant concern, and funding for security improvements is often limited. The sector also faces challenges in addressing the needs of small and rural water systems, which may have limited resources and expertise.

1. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV) reauthorizes and amends the Perkins Act, providing support for career and technical education through FY2012. The act authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for Perkins Act programs and activities. Perkins IV retains the overall purpose of the act, making only technical changes. The act refers to career and technical education (CTE) rather than vocational and technical education.

2. Perkins IV modifies the state allotment formula when there are ""additional funds"" above the FY2006 funding level. The formula is unchanged if funding is level funded at the FY2006 amount. States with growing populations will tend to receive increased grants, while states at their FY1998 grant amounts will continue to receive those grant amounts. Other states' grants will tend to decline, as funding shifts to states with more rapidly growing populations.

3. The act specifies how funds received by states must be allocated with respect to the percentage reserved at the state level and the percentage subsequently distributed to the local level. At least 85% of state grant funds must be distributed to the local level, and states may reserve up to 10% of the funds distributed to the local level for eligible recipients in rural areas and areas with high percentages or high numbers of CTE students. States have complete discretion in how much of local funding is distributed for CTE at the secondary level versus postsecondary CTE.

4. Perkins IV strengthens and substantially changes accountability requirements and associated sanctions for failing to meet these requirements. The act specifies separate core indicators of performance for the secondary and postsecondary levels, and links established between secondary core indicators of performance and ESEA. Eligible agencies and recipients are required to establish measures for each of the indicators and negotiate adjusted levels of performance.

5. The act requires eligible agencies to submit a state plan to the Secretary, which must cover a six-year time period and include specific information, such as describing the career and technical programs of study, detailing how the eligible agency will assist eligible recipients in developing articulation agreements, and explaining how CTE programs will prepare secondary students to graduate with a diploma. The plan must also describe how the eligible agency will report on and evaluate the integration of CTE programs with coherent and rigorous content aligned with state academic standards.",0

1. Cabo Verde is a small island nation with historical ties to the United States, and contemporary U.S.-Cabo Verdean relations are based on Cabo Verde's status as a model of democratic governance and a key partner in West Africa. The country's strategic location has made it a transshipment point for Latin American cocaine bound for Europe and a key refueling stopover for trans-Atlantic air traffic. U.S.-Cabo Verdean cooperation focuses on counternarcotics efforts and related military professionalization.

2. Cabo Verde is a small volcanic island archipelago located off the coast of Senegal in West Africa, with a lack of rain causing recurrent water shortages that pose a challenge for food production. The country has few natural resources, apart from its large maritime zone and beaches, which are a tourism destination. Cabo Verde was uninhabited when it was discovered in the 15th century by Portugal, which then colonized the island and later made it a slave trading center.

3. Most Cabo Verdeans are of mixed Portuguese and African descent and speak a Portuguese-African Creole, and the country's location in an 18th- and 19th-century whaling zone made it a key ship resupply and sailor recruiting center for U.S. vessels. This gave rise to a long-standing tradition of emigration to the United States and friendly U.S. ties, which both endure. There is a large Cabo Verdean population in New England.

4. Cabo Verde's political system takes into account its large expatriate population, whose remittances are a key source of private investment and hard currency. Expatriates may vote in national elections, although in presidential elections their collective vote may constitute no more than a fifth of all votes cast within the national territory. Foreign nationals resident in Cabo Verde are eligible to vote in local elections.

5. Cabo Verde became a democracy in 1991, following increasing demands for a multi-party political system by civil society activists and the Movement for Democracy (MPD). The MPD won a large parliamentary majority, the presidency, and multiple municipal elections, and has since pursued an economic reform-focused agenda. The party has sought to privatize state-owned firms, reform public spending, alleviate poverty, boost social services, and promote exports.

3. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during a Senate recess, but its interpretation has been subject to debate, with questions about the meaning of ""Recess"" and the minimum duration of a recess.

4. The President's January 4, 2012, recess appointments of Richard Cordray to the CFPB and three members to the NLRB were made during a three-day intrasession recess, which some argue is not a sufficient duration to trigger the recess appointment power.

5. A reviewing court would first need to determine whether the plaintiff has standing to challenge the appointments, which may depend on whether the plaintiff has suffered a concrete and particularized injury.

6. The standing inquiry may be especially rigorous for congressional plaintiffs, who must show that they have suffered an institutional injury that is not redressable through legislative means.

7. The political question doctrine may also bar judicial review of certain aspects of the appointments, particularly if they involve nonjusticiable political questions or require the court to make policy determinations.

8. The doctrine has been invoked to prevent judicial review of internal congressional processes, procedural aspects of impeachment, and the ratification of constitutional amendments.

9. A court may decline to review the validity of the appointments if it determines that the Senate's pro forma sessions are meaningful sessions of Congress that interrupt a longer recess, or if it lacks a judicially discoverable and manageable standard to determine the minimum duration of a recess.

The funding has fluctuated depending on the severity of the fire season in the preceding year. The agencies have traditionally been authorized to borrow from other accounts for fire suppression, but this has been limited in recent years.

5. Fuel reduction funding has been provided to protect lands and resources from wildfire damages by lowering fuel loads on federal lands. The funding has been used for prescribed burning and thinning, and has increased since the mid-1990s. However, the treatment acreage has stabilized at less than 3 million acres annually, which is less than 1% of federal lands.

6. The federal role in fire protection of non-federal lands and structures has been a topic of discussion, with some arguing that state and local governments should take more responsibility for fire protection. The federal government provides assistance to states, local governments, and communities to protect non-federal lands from wildfires. The funding for assistance programs has fluctuated over the years.

7. The high cost of wildfire management has been a concern, with some arguing that the costs are unsustainable and that better cost control and accountability are needed. The costs have risen due to increasingly severe wildfire seasons and the growing number of homes and people in and near forests. The agencies have been criticized for not having clear goals, strategies, and performance measures to contain wildland fire costs.",1

1. About 27.5% of state and local government employees, or around 6.6 million people, are not covered by Social Security, with coverage rates varying significantly across states.
2. Mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees has been recommended by recent deficit reduction groups to increase the universality of the program.
3. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects that Social Security expenditures will exceed income by 16% on average over the next 75 years, and trust fund assets will be exhausted in 2036.
4. Mandatory Social Security coverage is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds, closing 8-9% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall.
5. Supporters of mandatory coverage argue that it would simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions.
6. Opponents argue that mandatory coverage would not necessarily result in better benefit protections for workers, as state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits to keep overall pension costs down.
7. The portability of state and local pension plans is usually limited to positions within the same public pension system, whereas Social Security coverage is portable among most jobs.
8. Mandatory Social Security coverage would eventually eliminate the need for the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset (GPO), two provisions of Social Security law that are unpopular among the public and present administrative difficulties for SSA.",1

1. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides federal assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition, offering funding for training and reemployment services, as well as income support while enrolled in training.
2. To be eligible for TAA, a group of workers must petition the Department of Labor (DOL) and establish that their job loss was attributable to foreign trade, and individual workers must meet certain conditions, including separation from the firm, employment with the affected firm, and entitlement to state unemployment compensation.
3. TAA-certified workers may receive training and reemployment services, including case management, job search and relocation allowances, and training assistance, with a focus on occupational skills training, and may also be eligible for a tax credit for qualified health insurance premiums.
4. The Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides weekly income support payments to certified workers who have exhausted their unemployment compensation benefits and are enrolled in training, with a maximum of 117 weeks of benefits, and may also be eligible for additional TRA and completion TRA.
5. The Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) program provides a wage supplement for workers age 50 and over who are certified for TAA benefits and obtain reemployment at a lower wage, with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over two years.
6. The TAA program has undergone several reauthorizations and expansions since its inception in 1962, with the most recent reauthorization, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015, reinstating many of the eligibility and benefit provisions that were enacted in 2011.",1

1. The Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 established the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP), which offers supplemental dental and vision benefits to federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, and dependents. Enrollees are responsible for 100% of the premiums, and OPM does not review disputed claims.

2. Eligible individuals can enroll in FEDVIP during the standard open season for FEHB plans, and may change plans during open season each year or following a qualifying life event. New employees have 60 days to enroll, and enrollment can be done through the Internet or by calling 1-877-888-FEDS.

3. There are four nationwide dental plans and three regional plans, which provide coverage for various services including oral examinations, restorative procedures, and orthodontic services. Premiums vary by plan, geographic area, and residency, and individuals can choose a self-only, self +1, or family plan.

4. The three vision plans provide both nationwide and overseas coverage, and offer benefits such as eye exams, lenses, and frames, with varying copayments and limits. Premiums for vision plans are similar, with self +1 plans costing about double the self-only premium and family plans costing about triple.

5. Individuals should consider factors such as coverage under their FEHB plan, likelihood of using services, and risk aversion when deciding whether to enroll in FEDVIP, and can weigh the benefits against the premiums and consider using an FSA for qualified medical expenses. Enrollees can revisit their decisions every year during open season.",1

1. A sitting Member of the United States Senate is not directly affected by an indictment for a felony, and no rights or privileges are forfeited under the Constitution, statutory law, or the Rules of the Senate. Internal party rules may be relevant, and the Senate Republican Conference Rules require an indicted chairman or ranking Member to temporarily step aside from their leadership or chairmanship position. The Member's service in Congress would otherwise continue.

2. A Member of Congress does not automatically forfeit their office even upon conviction of a crime that constitutes a felony, and there is no express constitutional disability or ""disqualification"" from Congress for the conviction of a crime, other than under the Fourteenth Amendment for certain treasonous conduct. Under party rules, Members may lose their chairmanships of committees or ranking Member status upon conviction of a felony. Conviction of certain crimes may subject Senators to internal legislative disciplinary proceedings.

3. Expulsion of a Member from Congress does not result in the forfeiture or loss of one's federal pension, but the Member's conviction of certain crimes may lead to such forfeiture of retirement annuities, or the loss of all of the ""creditable service"" as a Member that one would have earned towards a federal pension. There are only three qualifications for congressional office, and these are set out in the United States Constitution. These constitutional qualifications are the exclusive qualifications for being a Member of Congress.

4. No specific or formal Rule of the Senate exists concerning the status of a Senator who has been indicted with respect to chairmanships or ranking Member status on committees of the Senate. The political parties in the Senate may adopt internal conference and caucus rules that may affect a Senator's leadership and committee positions and assignments. For example, Senate Republican Conference Rules have provided for the temporary loss of one's position as the chairman or ranking Member of a committee.

Each house of Congress has the express authority under Article I, Section 5, clause 2, of the United States Constitution to punish a Member for ""disorderly Behaviour"" and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, to expel a Member. The traditional practice in Congress has been to wait to impose congressional discipline, such as expulsion or censure against the Member, until the question of guilt has been at least initially resolved through the judicial system.

1. There are approximately 766 million acres of forestlands in the United States, with 58% being privately owned. The federal government has numerous programs to support forest management on these private forests and public forests. These programs support a variety of forest management and protection goals, including activities related to planning for and responding to wildfires. The Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers these programs, often with the assistance of state partner agencies.

2. Providing federal assistance for nonfederal forest landowners has been a component of USDA's programs for over a century. The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry in general, forestry assistance, and forestry research programs. Congress authorized specific forestry assistance programs in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924.

3. Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS, but are typically implemented by state partners, such as state forestry or natural resource agencies. The FS provides technical and financial aid to the states, which then provide information and assistance to private landowners or specified eligible entities. To be eligible to receive funds, each state must prepare a State Forest Action Plan, consisting of a statewide assessment of forest resource conditions and a long-term statewide forest resource strategy. The State Forest Action Plans are to be reviewed every 5 years and revised every 10 years.

4. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, in both real and constant dollars. The average annual appropriation over that time was $362.7 million, with a peak of $420.5 million in FY2010 and a low of $328.9 million in FY2017. The Administration requested $197.4 million in FY2019 and proposed to eliminate funding for seven of the programs and decrease funding for the others. Some FS programs have been repealed by previous farm bills, or have gone unfunded by Congress for several years.",1

1. Burma is a hub for transnational organized crime, with trafficking of drugs, humans, guns, wildlife, gems, and timber being major concerns. The country's extra-legal economy is so large that it's difficult to assess the size and structure of the economy. Corruption among officials facilitates trafficking and provides immunity from law enforcement and judicial action.

2. The country's border regions share features of ""ungoverned spaces"" with difficult terrain, ethnic tensions, and lack of government control. Cease-fire agreements have not improved the situation, and groups known for transnational crime have near autonomy in some areas. The influence of organized crime in Burma and the region remains difficult to reduce.

3. Corruption is widespread among Burmese officials, military, and police, with involvement in smuggling, money laundering, and corruption. Burma is one of the most corrupt countries in the world, and its weak implementation of anti-money laundering controls contributes to the use of its financial institutions by criminal elements. The country has signed but not ratified the UN Convention against Corruption.

4. The poor and vulnerable are often recruited into organized crime, growing opium poppy crops, poaching wildlife, and serving as couriers and mules for contraband. Many victims of transnational crime are the poor, who are trafficked to be child soldiers or slaves for sexual exploitation. Burma is party to international drug control treaties, but its goal of becoming drug-free by 2014 is considered unlikely.

5. The country is a major producer of opium, heroin, and methamphetamine, with production shifting to areas controlled by other cease-fire ethnic groups and the armed forces. The UWSA's commitment to ban opium poppy cultivation has led to an increase in methamphetamine production. Burma is also a significant producer of other synthetic drugs, threatening to turn the Golden Triangle into an ""Ice Triangle.""

6. The country is a major hub for human trafficking, with victims trafficked internally and regionally, and junta officials involved in trafficking for forced labor and child soldiers. The US Department of Labor has listed Burma among countries with goods produced by child labor or forced labor.

The presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs in the US has been a concern for some in the scientific community, as they feel it may lead to a brain drain and negatively impact job opportunities for US citizens. The number of foreign students in these programs has not kept pace with the number of US citizens.

2. Many foreign students use US graduate education programs as a stepping stone to immigration, with approximately 56% of foreign doctorate degree earners on temporary visas remaining in the US and eventually becoming citizens. Data on adjustments from temporary visas to permanent status reveal that approximately 6 in 10 new permanent residents occurred in 2007 and 2008 from adjustments of status admissions.

3. Foreign scientists and engineers serve the needs of industry at the doctorate level and also have been found to serve in major roles at the master's level. There are charges that US workers are adversely affected by the entry of foreign scientists and engineers, who reportedly accept lower wages than US citizens would accept.

4. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that between 2006 and 2016, employment in science and engineering fields will increase at a faster rate than other professional groups, primarily due to growth in mathematics and computer-related occupations. The growth rate will result from growth in mathematics and computer-related occupations.

5. The H-1B temporary admissions program has been a focus of attention in the scientific community, with reports claiming a nationwide shortage of scientists and engineers contributing to the decision by Congress to expand the skilled-labor preference system contained in the Immigration Act of 1990. The 1990 legislation more than doubled employment-based immigration, including scientists and engineers entering under the H-1B visa category.

2. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are digital representations of value that use cryptography for secure financial transactions and are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any government or institution. They are created through a process called mining, where complex mathematical problems are solved to validate transactions and add them to a public ledger called a blockchain.

3. The use of cryptocurrencies as money is still limited compared to traditional payment systems, with only a small number of businesses and individuals using them for transactions. However, proponents argue that they offer potential benefits, such as lower costs, greater privacy, and increased security.

4. For cryptocurrencies to be widely adopted, they must serve as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, but they currently face challenges in these areas. They are not widely accepted, their prices are highly volatile, and their scalability is uncertain.

5. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies raises concerns about their potential use in criminal activity, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, due to their pseudonymous nature. However, law enforcement has existing authorities to mitigate these risks, and cryptocurrency platforms can provide a public ledger of transactions that can be traced.

1. The Bankruptcy Code's Chapter 11 allows financially troubled businesses to reorganize and remain in operation, rather than liquidate. This chapter provides debtors with the opportunity to assume or reject executory contracts, including collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). The court generally approves rejection of a CBA if it is in the best interest of the debtor and all affected parties.

2. The Bankruptcy Code's Section 1113 outlines the procedures for rejecting a CBA, which is a unique process compared to other executory contracts. The section was added in 1984 in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco. The addition of Section 1113 clarified that CBAs cannot be rejected under Section 365, which governs executory contracts generally.

3. H.R. 3652 proposes several changes to Section 1113, including limiting the modifications to a CBA that a debtor can propose. The bill would require proposals to be limited to two years, be the minimum savings necessary for reorganization, and not burden the labor group more than other groups, including management personnel. These limitations aim to ensure that workers and retirees are not disproportionately affected by business bankruptcies.

4. The bill would also change the process for approving rejection of a CBA, requiring the parties to have reached an impasse and the court to consider alternative proposals by the authorized representative. The court would need to find that further negotiations are not likely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement and that the debtor's proposal meets the requirements of Section 1113(b)(1). The court would also need to consider the impact on all subsidiaries and affiliates of the debtor company.

5. The bill proposes to add a presumption that the debtor has overly burdened the labor group if it has implemented a program of incentive pay, bonuses, or other financial returns for insiders or senior management personnel during the bankruptcy or within 180 days before the case began. This presumption could be rebutted, but it would restrict the court's discretion in approving rejection of a CBA.

6. The bill would extend the notice period for hearings on applications for rejection from 10 to 21 days and limit the parties who can appear and be heard to the debtor and the authorized representative.

1. The distinction between net job loss and gross job loss is crucial in understanding the labor market, as net job loss is a serious economic problem, while gross job loss is a normal part of a market economy. Gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in a given period, whereas net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains.

2. The labor market is highly dynamic, with significant gross job loss and gross job gains occurring even during expansions, but net job loss typically only occurs during recessions. In the third quarter of 2007, gross job loss and gains equaled 7.5 million and 7.2 million per quarter, respectively.

3. Trade, trade deficits, offshore outsourcing, overseas investment, and economic restructuring all cause gross job loss, but in normal economic conditions, none typically causes net job loss. These phenomena have the same effect on employment as technological advances, which can cause gross job loss in certain industries but lead to overall economic growth.

4. The historical experience confirms that trade liberalization has no effect on net employment, as employment has steadily increased during the post-war period despite rising imports. The implementation of trade liberalization agreements has virtually no relationship to changes in net employment.

5. The trade deficit does not cause net job loss, as it leads to gross job gains in other sectors, such as plant, equipment, housing, and interest-sensitive goods. The historical experience confirms this, as the large increase in the trade deficit in the 1980s and 1990s took place at a time of rising employment and falling unemployment.

6. Economic restructuring, such as the collapse of the dot-com industry, can cause gross job loss, but it is not a primary cause of net job loss. The economy has not had any problem offsetting gross job loss with a greater number of gross job gains in most years.

7. Government policies, such as expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, can be used to mitigate net job loss, and policies to help workers transition into new employment situations are more effective than policies to impede gross job loss. The government's role in insuring workers against the risks associated with gross job loss can also be viewed through a broader prism than the unemployment insurance program.",1

The Trump Administration's shift on North Korea, including its decision to suspend U.S.-South Korean military exercises, has increased questions among Japanese policymakers about the depth and durability of the U.S. commitment to Japan's security. Abe has said he would be willing to meet with Kim to resolve the abduction issue, but analysts doubt that Kim has reason to conciliate Abe given his newfound stature in international diplomacy.

Japan's relations with South Korea remain precarious despite a rapprochement in 2016, with Koreans holding strong grievances about Japan's colonial rule over the peninsula and the issue of Korean comfort women who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers in World War II. The two countries have a territorial dispute over a group of small islands in the Sea of Japan, known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese.

The Detention Standards, which outline the medical care required to be provided to detainees, do not have the force of law, and there are concerns that they are not being followed. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS) is responsible for the provision of health care to noncitizens detained by ICE.

2. There have been reports of problems with access to medical care, including delays in receiving care, lack of access to specialized care, and inadequate treatment of chronic conditions. The covered benefits package, which outlines the health care services available to detainees, has been amended several times, limiting the scope of medical care for detainees. Detainees who require non-emergency medical care beyond what can be provided at the detention facilities must get preauthorization, which can be a lengthy process.

3. The debate surrounding the appropriate standard of care for noncitizens in detention is ongoing, with some arguing that detainees should receive the same level of care as U.S. citizens, while others argue that the cost of care should be considered in light of the fact that many U.S. citizens lack health insurance. ICE has reported a decline in the number of deaths of aliens in detention between 2004 and 2008, but critics argue that mortality rates are not a reliable measure of the quality of care.

1. Inland waterways are a significant component of the nation's marine transportation system, carrying approximately one-sixth of the national volume of intercity cargo on 25,000 miles of commercially active inland and intracoastal waterways.
2. The Inland Waterway System (IWS) is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and covers 38 states, handling approximately half of all inland waterway freight.
3. The Corps develops, operates, and maintains the infrastructure of these commercial waterways, and also maintains and regulates the channel depths through dredging and water management.
4. The current revenue source, a set tax on fuel, is insufficient to cover the nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures on inland waterways, leading to a shortfall that is limiting the number of new and ongoing inland waterway construction projects.
5. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) was established in 1978 to fund inland waterway projects, but its balance has varied considerably over the years, and recent proposals have been made to increase user fees or change the cost-sharing arrangement for inland waterway projects.

1. Congress has used commemoratives to express gratitude, dramatize virtues, and perpetuate remembrance of significant events since its inception. The first commemoratives were primarily in the form of individually struck medals. Over time, Congress broadened the scope of commemoratives to include special days, monuments, and memorials. Today, commemoratives can take many forms, including coins, stamps, and post office namings.

2. There are two categories of commemorative options available to Congress: legislative and nonlegislative. Legislative options require passage of a bill or resolution by the House, Senate, or both chambers. Nonlegislative options can be accomplished by individual offices without legislative approval. Examples of nonlegislative options include creating individual office awards, giving floor speeches, and sending official letters.

3. Naming post offices is a common practice in Congress, with almost 18% of all statutes enacted between 2007 and 2016 being post office naming acts. Legislation naming post offices for persons has become a very common practice, with post offices named for locally esteemed individuals, deceased elected officials, fallen military personnel, and celebrities. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has a policy against considering legislation designating post office buildings for living persons, except in certain circumstances. Each Member of the congressional delegation representing the state in which the post office is located must indicate, in writing, their support of the bill.

4. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) issues commemorative stamps to celebrate persons, anniversaries, and historical and cultural phenomena. Although Congress has approved legislation stipulating requirements for numerous other awards and decorations, there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals. When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate, Congress has, by legislative action, provided for the creation of a medal on an ad hoc basis.

5. Congress has authorized the creation of monuments and memorials to commemorate historic figures, events, and movements. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) provides standards for the consideration and placement of monuments and memorials in areas administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and the General Services Administration (GSA) in the District of Columbia. The CWA requires that no commemorative work may be established in the District of Columbia unless specifically authorized by Congress.

1. The study compared the effectiveness of two proteome analysis methods: a 2D method involving gel-based separation and LC-MS/MS, and a 3D method that adds an additional protein separation step using microsol IEF. The 3D method identified 22% more proteins with two or more peptides than the 2D method, and nearly 2.5 times more high-confidence, nonredundant peptides. The 3D method also provided better sequence coverage for low-abundance proteins.

2. The study found that repetitive LC-MS/MS runs can increase protein coverage, but the gains diminish with each additional run. Adding a second replicate run increased protein coverage by 33%, while adding a third and fourth replicate only increased coverage by 13% and 6%, respectively. The 3D method, which adds an additional protein separation step, represents a more efficient use of instrument time and provides better proteome coverage.",1

1. The study compared the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) with tonsillectomy in adult patients. The incidence of bleeding after tonsillectomy is approximately 0.5%-10%, with death occurring in 1 in 20,000 patients. The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was 5.05% in the tonsillectomy group and 1.45% in the SMUPPP group, showing a statistically significant difference. The postoperative bleeding rate of the tonsillectomy group was similar to the rates mentioned in the literature.

2. The study suggests that the suturing technique used in SMUPPP, which involves approximating the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa, may have decreased the incidence of postoperative bleeding. The bleeding rates for tonsillectomy and SMUPPP patients remained significantly higher among tonsillectomy patients whose muscular tissue of the tonsillar fossa was not approximated using interrupted 3-0 vicryl sutures through the tissue. The study concludes that submucosal tonsillectomy, which is a part of SMUPPP, has a lower incidence of postoperative delayed hemorrhage compared with tonsillectomy using unipolar cautery in adult patients. The study recommends routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce the rate of postoperative hemorrhage.",1

1. The study investigated the expression of five microRNAs (miR-125a, miR-206, miR-145, miR-21, and miR-10b) in breast cancer tissues and their relationship with clinical pathology. The results showed that miR-125a, miR-206, and miR-145 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues, while miR-21 and miR-10b were upregulated.

2. The expression of miR-145 was negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis, and was associated with negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression. MiR-206 was highly expressed in patients with small tumors, negative ER, negative PR, and negative HER-2.

3. MiR-21 was highly expressed in older, postmenopausal patients with lymph node metastasis and positive HER-2 expression, and was not related to tumor size and expression levels of topoisomerase 2a (TOP2A), ER, and PR. MiR-10b was related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and positive TOP2A.

4. The study suggests that miR-145, miR-125a, and miR-206 may be used as markers for early diagnosis of breast cancer, and may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. MiR-21 and miR-10b may be correlated with the invasion and development of breast cancer.

5. The results also indicate that miR-21 and miR-125a may contribute to the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer cells, while miR-145 and miR-206 may accelerate the development of treatment methods for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

1. The study investigates the role of tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in chronic allograft injury (CAI) in a rat model of renal transplantation. TGM2 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell adhesion, and inflammation. The study focuses on the expression of TGM2 in mononuclear leukocytes and its potential role in the pathogenesis of CAI. The rat model used is a well-established model of CAI, characterized by a minor mismatch in the MHC class-1 locus and no immunosuppression.

2. The study shows that TGM2 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in mononuclear leukocytes, particularly in activated monocytes, which accumulate in the vascular bed of renal allografts during acute rejection. The expression of TGM2 is induced in graft tissue upon allogenic transplantation, but no quantitative changes are detected at the protein level. The study suggests that TGM2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of CAI, possibly by promoting inflammation and fibrosis. The expression of TGM2 is also detected in renal tubules and glomeruli in allografts.

3. The study demonstrates that TGM2 is a marker of activated monocytes, which are involved in the pathogenesis of CAI. The expression of TGM2 is not confined to M2-like monocytes, and its functional relevance in monocytes is unclear. The study suggests that TGM2 may be involved in apoptosis, as its expression is linked to the activation of caspase-3. The expression of TGM2 is also detected in the surrounding blood plasma, which may contribute to vascular remodeling.

4. The study investigates the role of TGM2 in the pathogenesis of CAI using a transglutaminase inhibitor, cystamine. The inhibitor is applied chronically for 4 weeks after transplantation, but no significant differences are observed in renal function or graft remodeling between the treated and untreated groups. The study suggests that TGM2 may not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CAI, or that the inhibitor may not have been effective in blocking its activity. The study has limitations, including the use of a single dose of the inhibitor and a short treatment period.

1. Endothelial cells were stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 to produce endothelial microparticles (EMPs), which were then characterized and quantified using flow cytometric analysis and transmission electron microscopy.
2. The EMPs were introduced into an IV bag containing 0.9% normal saline and mixed with a primed CVVH circuit, and the perfusate was circulated through a CVVH filter for 70 minutes.
3. EMP levels were measured at 5-10 minute intervals, and the results showed a rapid decline in EMP levels, with 50% clearance seen in the first 30 minutes and a plateau at around 29% of the starting concentration after 40 minutes.
4. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis, suggesting that the CVVH filter entraps EMPs.
5. The experimental conditions achieved a plasma level of EMPs similar to that seen in human clinical disease, and the results support the idea of CVVH as a therapeutic intervention in acute lung injury (ALI) due to EMP clearance.
6. However, the model has limitations, including the saturable phenomenon of EMP clearance, the relatively small volume of the CVVH circuit compared to human circulation, and the lack of convection and pressure gradient forces.
7. The authors suggest that frequent changing of the CVVH filter, conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to specialty CVVH filters, and combining selective filters with convection and pressure gradients could improve EMP clearance.
8. Clinical data support the protective role of CVVH in ALI management, and the authors plan to conduct further studies to assay patients pre- and post-dialysis and to examine the efficacy of CVVH in rodent models of EMP-induced ALI.
9. The study demonstrates that standard dialysis alone can remove EMPs due to their small size, and the application of dialysis to rodent models of EMP-induced ALI could examine efficacy in ongoing diseases and EMP thresholds associated with worse injuries.",1

2. Optimal medical therapy, including anti-anginal and disease-modifying agents, is as effective as revascularization in reducing the risk of adverse coronary events, and sublingual nitroglycerin is a key component of this therapy.
3. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin spray on time to onset of angina during exercise in patients with chronic stable angina.
4. The study found a dose-dependent increase in time to onset of moderate angina following administration of nitroglycerin spray, with the 1.6-mg group showing the most pronounced increase.
5. The occurrence of a minimum 1.0-mm ST-segment depression was later in all treatment groups compared to the placebo group, and nitroglycerin spray was generally well tolerated.

1. The residual and resistant microorganisms in the root canal system are the primary cause of endodontic treatment failures, and fungi, such as Candida albicans, may play a key role in periradicular diseases. C. albicans has been found in 20% of endodontic treatment failures, and its presence may be due to coronal leakage or contamination during treatment. The fungus's ability to survive without nutrients and resist intracanalicular treatment materials may contribute to its persistence.

2. Candida species, including C. albicans, are considered dentinophilic microorganisms due to their tendency to invade dentin. The invasive nature of C. albicans and its resistance to some intracanalicular medications, such as calcium hydroxide, may explain its presence in failed endodontic treatments. Repeated treatment failures may require a root-end resection, which highlights the importance of apical sealing and reducing microorganisms.

3. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a widely used endodontic biomaterial that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since 1998. MTA has several advantages, including excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, and antimicrobial effects. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as delayed setting time, poor handling properties, and high price.

4. MTA-Angelus is a type of MTA that has been reported to have good marginal adaptation, sealing ability, and antibacterial and antifungal effects. It has been shown to be inflammation-free in most cases and has a strong fungicidal effect against C. albicans. MTA-Angelus has the benefit of containing arsenic levels below the limit set by the ISO 9917-1 standard.

5. The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set Proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus against C. albicans. The study used a tube-dilution test to assess the antifungal activity of the materials at concentrations of 50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the in vitro antifungal properties of the two materials.

The study recruited 50 hemiparetic stroke patients and 40 sex- and age-matched normal control subjects. The patients were tested using a tracking task and a joint position sense test.

2. The tracking task measured the accuracy of movement and proprioceptive sense in the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints, while the joint position sense test evaluated the ability to actively reproduce the position of the MP joint. The tests were conducted on the hand ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere of the patients and the corresponding hand of the control subjects. The results showed that the stroke group had a lower accuracy index and higher reposition error scores compared to the control group.

3. The study found a significant correlation between ipsilateral sensory deficits and motor deficits, indicating that stroke patients have difficulty performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensorimotor functions. The results suggest that ipsilateral sensory deficits may be connected with bilateral hemisphere activation during performance of motor tasks. The primary sensory cortex conveys efferent projection to the posterior parietal cortex, which is connected bilaterally through the corpus callosum.

4. The study's findings imply that interest in the ipsilateral side of stroke patients should focus on ipsilateral sensory deficits as well as ipsilateral motor deficits. Motor deficits of the ipsilateral limbs of individuals with stroke have been reported in many studies, and the current study showed sensory deficits related to proprioceptive sense. The difficultly stroke patients experience in task performance using the ipsilateral upper limb may be affected by both motor and sensory deficits.

5. The study's results are in accordance with those of several previous studies, suggesting the presence of motor deficits in upper limbs ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere in the visuomotor tracking task. A possible mechanism for the motor dysfunction in the ipsilateral hemisphere of stroke patients has been suggested by previous studies, which reported bilateral hemisphere activation when normal subjects executed a unilateral upper limb task. If functional integrity of both the right and left brain cortex is necessary for normal motor control of the upper limb, it is expected that the ipsilateral upper limb would be affected after stroke.

The study began in 2001 and has collected data on over 77,000 participants. The study's objective is to identify factors associated with adverse health outcomes, including diabetes.

2. The study used self-administered surveys and electronic personnel files to collect data on participants' sleep characteristics, mental health, and demographic information. The surveys included questions on sleep duration, trouble sleeping, and sleep apnea, as well as mental health symptoms such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The data were collected at baseline and at two follow-up assessments.

3. The study found that participants who reported trouble sleeping, sleep apnea, and shorter sleep duration were more likely to develop diabetes during the follow-up period. The associations between sleep characteristics and diabetes risk were independent of known diabetes risk factors, including age, sex, education, BMI, and race/ethnicity. The study also found that mental health conditions, such as PTSD and depression, were associated with higher diabetes risk.

4. The study's results suggest that sleep characteristics and mental health conditions may be related to diabetes risk through different pathways. The associations between sleep characteristics and diabetes risk were not explained by mental health conditions, and vice versa. The study's findings have implications for the prevention and management of diabetes.

5. The study's results are consistent with previous research that has found associations between sleep characteristics and diabetes risk. However, the study's findings are unique in that they were obtained from a large, population-based sample of military personnel, and they controlled for a range of mental health conditions. The study's results may not generalize to other populations, but they suggest that sleep characteristics and mental health conditions are important factors to consider in diabetes prevention and management.

The study's results suggest that military personnel who report trouble sleeping, sleep apnea, or shorter sleep duration may be at higher risk for diabetes, and that mental health conditions may also play a role. The study's findings may inform strategies for preventing and managing diabetes in military personnel.

1. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Italy is estimated to be around 0.49%, with a higher prevalence in women than men, and the incidence rate is higher in females than males. The disease is more common in people aged 65 years and older, and Italy has the second-highest percentage of population aged 65 years in the world. The prevalence of RA is expected to increase in Italy due to the aging population.

2. The economic burden of RA in Italy is significant, with a total social cost of around €3.5 billion per year, and direct medical costs accounting for only 21% of the total costs. Non-medical and indirect costs, such as informal care and productivity loss, account for the remaining 79% of the total costs. The economic burden of RA is expected to increase in the next 30 years, with a peak of €4 billion in 2029.

3. The costs of RA vary depending on the severity of the disease, with higher costs associated with more severe disease. The use of biological agents has contributed to increased direct medical costs, but has also been associated with improved disease activity, joint damage, and productivity. The development of biosimilar biologics may alter the landscape of biologics and their associated costs in the future.

4. The assessment of the economic burden of RA should consider both direct and indirect costs, as well as the long-term consequences of the disease. Short-term analyses may be misleading, and reliable health-economic evaluations should estimate the long-term consequences of the disease and the effects of preventing or delaying the development of severe disability.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third most common cause of global cancer-related mortality, with a high incidence in developing countries and males. The risk factors for HCC development include chronic liver inflammation, autoimmune hepatitis, and environmental carcinogens. The prognosis and therapeutic options for HCC depend on the severity of underlying liver disease, and the median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced disease is estimated at 58 months. HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

2. The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is multifactorial and involves dysregulation of multiple pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, c-MET, promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. HGF-CMET signaling is critical for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair after acute injury. HGF was first discovered in 1984 as a mitogenic protein for rat hepatocytes in vitro.

3. HGF is secreted primarily by mesenchymal cells as an inactive single-chain precursor, which is bound to heparin proteoglycans within the extracellular matrix. Circulating pro-HGF undergoes proteolytic conversion into an active two-polypeptide chain heterodimeric linked by a disulfide bond. The active form of HGF includes an α-chain containing four kringle domains and an amino-terminal loop domain, and a β-chain containing a serine protease homology domain. HGF is a ligand for the MET receptor, also known as cellular MET or c-MET.

4. The MET receptor is expressed predominantly on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells of many organs, including the liver, kidney, prostate, pancreas, kidney, muscle, and bone marrow. Like HGF, c-MET is synthesized as an inactive single-chain precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage into a disulfide-linked heterodimer consisting of",0

1. The association between diabetes and cancer has been debated for over a century, with recent studies suggesting that type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors. The use of insulin, especially long-acting insulin analogues like glargine, has raised concerns about promoting cancer growth and development.

2. While some studies have found an increased risk of cancer associated with glargine, others have found no significant difference compared to other types of insulin, and the evidence remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between diabetes, insulin, and cancer, and to determine the potential benefits and risks of different treatment options.",1

1. Adamantinoma of the tibia is a rare, slow-growing primary tumor of the bone, with approximately 300 reported cases in the English language literature. The most common site of metastasis is to the lungs, and metastases to regional lymph nodes are rare. There is limited information regarding the best practice plan for their management in the literature.

2. The authors report two cases of tibial adamantinoma that were problematic from a diagnostic point of view, including one case that presented with groin metastases initially diagnosed as a cutaneous adnexal carcinoma. The correct diagnosis was made after reviewing the patient's past clinical history of surgical excision of a left tibial adamantinoma three years previously. The patient underwent revision surgery for non-union of the left tibia in 2010.

3. The literature search revealed 10 cases of inguinal lymph node metastases from adamantinoma of the tibia, with details of reference number, year reported, author, sex, age at diagnosis, bone involved, location in bone, character and duration of symptoms, latent period, treatment, and outcome. The search was limited to the English language using search terms including ""adamantinoma of tibia"" and ""tibial adamantinoma and metastases"" and ""inguinal lymph node metastases"".

4. Adamantinoma of the tibia can be divided into two main groups based on their histology and biological behavior: classical adamantinoma and differentiated adamantinoma. Classical adamantinoma refers to the prototype cases with a predominance of epithelial tumor cells and is associated with a destructive growth pattern on radiology. Patients with classical adamantinoma are usually of an older age group with a reported range of 15-65 years.

5. Differentiated adamantinoma of the tibia has a predominance of an osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia-like pattern with scant epithelial tumor elements and is commonly seen in an intracortical location. Many authors suggest that osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia, a benign lesion occurring commonly in the tibia of children under 10 years of age, is related to adamantinomas and may even be a precursor lesion for adamantinomas. In such scenarios, tibial adamantinomas have often been misdiagnosed as fibrous dysplasia.

6. Distant metastases have been reported in adamantinoma of the long bones in about 15-20% of cases",0

1. Antireflection technology plays a crucial role in increasing light coupling into the active region of solar cells, and nanostructures with sizes comparable to the wavelength of the utilized solar spectrum have been proposed to reduce light reflectivity.
2. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures, which have a wide bandgap and cannot absorb sunlight, have been fabricated as antireflective layers using various approaches, including a seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions.
3. ZnO nanowhiskers (NWs) with different lengths were grown on the surface of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells using the two-step process, and the density and length of ZnO NWs were optimized for improved solar cell performance.
4. The results show that the efficiency of CZ silicon solar cells can be improved by 3% using ZnO NWs as the antireflective layer, and the short-circuit current density of the solar cells coated by ZnO NWs is higher than that of the referenced cell.
5. The study demonstrates that ZnO NWs can effectively reduce the reflectivity of solar cells and improve their external quantum efficiency, and the optimal growth time for ZnO NWs is 45 minutes, which results in the highest efficiency improvement.",1

1. Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive sweating, which affects 0.6 to 1.0% of the population, primarily young adults, and can cause significant discomfort and embarrassment.
2. The condition typically manifests in childhood and early adolescence, does not occur during sleep, and can be exacerbated by emotional stress, with primary characteristics including intense discomfort, social, affective, and professional impairment.
3. Various treatment options are available, including topical and systemic therapies, iontophoresis, regional nerve block, and botulinum toxin injection, but they have limitations, and video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathetic surgery has been accepted as a form of treatment for primary palmar hyperhidrosis.
4. The aim of this study was to compare two simplified methods for the treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis, involving transection of the sympathetic chain at the level of either the third or fourth rib (R3 or R4 sympathicotomy).
5. Between January 1999 and April 2009, 133 patients with primary hyperhidrosis underwent video-assisted thoracic sympathicotomy, with 62 males and 71 females, and a mean age of 22.56.5 years.
6. The most common clinical manifestation of hyperhidrosis was palmar and axillary sweating (in 39.9%), followed by palmar sweating alone (in 33.8%), and axillary sweating alone (in 26.3%).
7. The study found that R4 sympathicotomy decreased the extent of side effects, including compensatory sweating, compared to R3 sympathicotomy, without compromising efficacy.
8. No patient requested reoperation in either group, and no patient expressed regret after surgery, with the dominating indication for sympathetic surgery being hyperhidrosis of the upper limb.
9. The study suggests that R4 sympathicotomy should be the method of choice for the treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis, as it reduces the incidence of severe compensatory symptoms and has similar success rates to R3 sympathicotomy.",1

1. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons with Lewy bodies. The clinical diagnosis of PD can be challenging, especially in mild or uncertain cases, and it remains difficult to differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes. Accurate and early diagnosis is key to correct management and prognostication.

2. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or SPECT have offered various tests to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and sympathetic innervation of the heart have become popular and are widely used in clinical practice. Imaging of DAT binding with [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) successfully visualizes the presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract.

3. DAT SPECT abnormalities can help support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes by excluding patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism who have normal nigrostriatal function. However, DAT imaging as a standalone tool cannot differentiate between the various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy. The use of either DAT SPECT or MIBG scintigraphy alone is insufficient for distinguishing PD from non-PD.

4. The study compared the results of SPECT studies of striatal DAT receptors and myocardial MIBG scintigraphy with the clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes. The patients underwent both [I]-MIBG scintigraphy and DAT SPECT within a 4-month period for a differential diagnosis between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and all procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards on human investigation.

5. The final diagnosis was made by neurologists who carefully assessed the medical history and symptoms, the possible response to dopaminergic treatment, and the diagnostic MRI findings. Five patients were diagnosed with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA) and two patients fulfilled the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke criteria for probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The brain SPECT scans were acquired according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine procedure guidelines for brain neurotransmission SPECT using [I]-labeled DAT ligands.

1. Amblyomma testudinarium is a species of tick that has been reported to bite humans in Asian countries, and it is known to be distributed in Korea. In Korea, human infestation of A. testudinarium is rare, with only two previously reported cases in elderly Korean persons. The present case reports an additional case of perianal infestation with A. testudinarium and provides histopathologic observations of its attachment to the skin. The patient, a 73-year-old Korean man, presented with a round nodule in the left perianal area.

2. The patient recalled a trip to a water reservoir located at Yeonggwang-gun, a rural county in Jeollanam-do province, South Korea, one month before the presentation. He defecated in the sitting posture on the grass near the water reservoir and felt the pain of a sting around the anus. The gross appearance of the tick bite site was characterized by a mild swelling and erythema. The patient agreed to surgical treatment of the skin lesion to remove the perianal tick.

3. The tick was identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on morphological characteristics, including the pedipalps, scutum, eyes, and coxae. The warm temperature and subtropical vegetation fauna are known to be a proper environmental condition for A. testudinarium. The tick is more common in tropical areas, including Southeast Asia and the Indian peninsula. In Japan, A. testudinarium is one of the most common ticks infesting humans, especially in southwestern areas.

4. The histopathology of skin responses to infection with the present female A. testudinarium shows that the dermis is infiltrated with various inflammatory cells associated with both acute and chronic reactions. The inflammatory findings are similar to those reported by other researchers on Amblyomma species experimentally and naturally infested in various vertebrate hosts. Around the lesion abutting the cement, an interesting area having relatively few inflammatory cells was observed, which is called the paucicellular zone. The biologic factors causing a zone of minimal cellular inflammation are not exactly known but are likely due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the tick saliva.",1

1. The study investigated the genetic mutations of the TNNT2 gene in 173 Japanese patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and identified three reported mutations and a new mutation in 11 individuals from four families. The mutations were associated with different clinical features, including arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy, and sudden death.

2. The study found that the clinical importance of the mutations was not solely determined by the type of mutation, as families with the same genetic mutation showed similar but not identical phenotypes. Additionally, sudden death in youth was observed in all of the families studied.

3. The study also found that the deletion/deletion polymorphism of intron 3 of the TNNT2 gene was present in 51% of the patients studied, and was associated with a higher incidence of apical HCM or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). However, the clinical significance of this polymorphism is unclear.

4. The study's findings suggest that the relationship between genetic mutations and clinical outcome in HCM is complex and influenced by multiple factors, and that genetic testing alone may not be sufficient to predict prognosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the genetic basis of HCM and to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",1

1. The Schistosomatidae family includes several digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles that alternate between intermediate freshwater gastropods and definitive hosts such as birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals. Schistosoma is the best-studied genus of Schistosomatidae, with six species that infect humans and cause schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease considered one of the most serious public health issues, with 237 million people requiring treatment worldwide. The disease is endemic in 77 countries, and its transmission is dependent on the existence and distribution of intermediate hosts.

2. The development of powerful methods to analyze nucleic acids and proteins has changed the way biological data is surveyed, allowing for a better understanding of processes such as host-parasite interaction. The application of these technologies, together with the development of powerful computational tools and methods, has expanded our perspective of schistosome biology. The Schistosoma genome sequence data has been used to identify genetic loci that determine important traits such as host specificity, virulence, and drug resistance. The genome sequences of S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni have been decoded, providing a means for gene discovery and gene function analysis.

3. Transcriptomic analyses have been used to study differential regulation in gene expression and identify splicing variants, which are essential for understanding parasite biology and evolution. The availability of sequence data has opened up new possibilities for the development of approaches to unravel mechanisms of parasite infection, host-parasite interaction, and diagnostics improvement. User-friendly databases have been created to integrate genome and proteome sequence data along with functional annotation of genes and gene products. These resources support biological and biomedical research and open new frontiers in evolutionary and functional genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics of Schistosoma species and other parasites.",1

1. The study analyzed the morbidity and mortality rates of 86 patients who underwent simultaneous resection for synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCLM) and found that the overall morbidity rate was 64% and the anastomotic leakage rate was 21%. The predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage were intraoperative blood loss and operation time greater than 8 hours, respectively. The study suggests that staged resections may be a better option for patients who are expected to have a longer operation time.

2. The study also found that the extent of hepatectomy, sequence of colectomy, hepatectomy, anastomosis, use of the Pringle maneuver, and total time of the Pringle maneuver were not predictive factors for anastomotic leakage or postoperative complications. The site of primary tumor was not a predictive factor for anastomotic leakage in this series, and the use of a diverting stoma was not a predictive factor for absence of postoperative anastomotic leakage. The study concludes that a randomized, controlled trial is needed to elucidate the efficacy of a temporary diverting stoma.",1

1. The study aimed to validate two scores for measuring patients' ability to use metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), identify common errors, and determine patients who need educational programs. The study was conducted in three phases: reliability validation, content validation, and criterion and discriminant validation. The sample consisted of 72 patients with asthma, and the inclusion criteria were diagnosis of asthma, outpatient treatment for at least two years, and age between 15 and 65 years. The patients were excluded if they had previously participated in educational programs.

2. The first phase involved validating the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, and the results showed interobserver disagreement in 19% and 25% of DPI and MDI scores, respectively. The expert panel suggested modifications to the scores, which were then applied to a new sample of patients. The modified scores were more practical and consisted of a single table for assessing inhaler technique. The maximum total score remained the same for MDI technique, but increased for DPI technique.

3. The second phase involved content validation, where an expert panel evaluated the modified scores and suggested changes. The panel comprised three pulmonologists, two pediatric pulmonologists, and two allergists. The changes included adding an item regarding patient head position and defining TLC (total lung capacity). The modified scores were then applied to a new sample of patients.

4. The third phase involved criterion and discriminant validation, where patients were randomly selected to participate in the study. They were given placebo-containing inhalers and asked to use them as they normally would. Each patient was evaluated simultaneously by two pharmacists, who used the modified scores. The results showed good interobserver agreement in classifying patients as able or unable to use DPIs and MDIs.

5. The study found that the most common difficulty encountered by patients was maintaining TLC after deep inhalation. Other common errors included incorrect speed of inhalation, not exhaling prior to inhalation, and not holding their breath correctly. The results were consistent with previous studies, which found that patients often make errors when using inhaler devices.

6. The study validated the MDI and DPI technique scores, which can be used to identify and correct inhaler technique errors during visits. The scores can also be used to classify patients as able or unable to use their inhalers. The study showed that the proportion of MDI technique errors was higher than that of DPI technique errors.

1. The bacteriocin enterocin S37 was isolated from Enterococcus faecalis S37, which was obtained from chicken feces. Enterocin S37 showed antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, and Enterococcus faecalis, but not against other tested bacteria. The antibacterial activity was stable at different pH values and high temperatures.

2. The purification of enterocin S37 involved ammonium sulfate precipitation and two reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography steps, resulting in a 10-fold increase in activity. The purified enterocin S37 had a molecular weight between 4 and 6 kDa and was sensitive to proteases. The activity of enterocin S37 was increased by the combination with K channel modulators, such as pinacidil and cromakalim.

3. The mode of action of enterocin S37 is thought to involve the depletion of intracellular potassium levels by interacting with KATP channels, leading to the loss of intracellular components and cell death. The resistant variant of L. monocytogenes was affected by the combination of enterocin S37 and K channel modulators, but not by enterocin S37 alone. The lipid composition of the membrane plays an important role in the efficiency of bacteriocin activity, and enterocin S37 may interact with membrane lipids to form pores and cause cell death.",1

2. A total of 28 children were enrolled and received dosing in the phase 1 study, with 15 having spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 13 having spinal muscular atrophy type 3.
3. The lumbar punctures were performed using either a 22- to 25-gauge spinal anesthesia needle, and the procedure was facilitated by anesthesia and/or sedation and fluoroscopy or ultrasonography.
4. The majority of lumbar punctures were carried out using either a 22- (48%) or 25-gauge (37%) needle inserted in the L3-L4 (44%) or L4-L5 (29%) space.
5. Of the 73 lumbar punctures performed, 68% had no complications, while lumbar puncture-related adverse events were reported in 32%, with the most common being headache, back pain, and post-lumbar puncture syndrome.
6. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest incidence of adverse events was reported in older children, children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3, and when a larger 21- or 22-gauge needle was used.
7. The use of a 24-gauge needle or smaller was associated with a lower incidence of complications, and all post-dural puncture headaches resolved with conservative treatment without the need for a therapeutic blood patch.

1. The Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education introduced clinical governance (CG) in 2009 as a framework for improving quality and safety in hospitals. CG aims to ensure high standards of care and create an environment where excellence in clinical care can flourish. The CG model in Iran consists of seven interlocking components, including clinical effectiveness, clinical audit, and risk management.

2. Senior managers in Iranian medical universities were interviewed to explore their views on facilitators and barriers to CG implementation. The study found that senior managers accepted that improving quality of healthcare should be integral to their role and essential to safeguard patient care. They believed that quality improvement is a strategic goal to achieve central government targets.

3. The study identified five main themes: knowledge and attitude, culture, organizational factors, managerial factors, and barriers. Senior managers believed that having adequate knowledge about CG and a positive attitude towards the program are essential for its implementation. Continuous training about CG concept and principles can foster a positive attitude towards the program.

4. A supportive culture was seen as a key factor in CG implementation, with teamwork and readiness for change being essential. Senior managers believed that a culture that promotes alignment of CG goals at both managerial and staff levels should be developed. CG components need to be embedded in day-to-day work.

5. Organizational commitment towards CG was seen as crucial, with senior managers emphasizing the importance of allocating adequate staff and resources to implement the program. The development and dissemination of national standards were also recognized as essential. Effective organizational interactions within and between departments were highlighted as key to successful CG implementation.

6. Managerial commitment and executive ability were seen as vital to CG implementation, with senior managers recognizing themselves as ultimately accountable for clinical activities and quality of care. They believed that successful outcomes depend on managers' participation in quality procedures and their level of commitment. Senior managers should demonstrate executive capabilities to motivate departments to implement CG principles.

7. Barriers to CG implementation included a shortage of staff and limited dedicated resources, lack of support from physicians and medical staff, legal challenges, and inadequate supporting systems. Senior managers felt overwhelmed by the volume of work and shortage of resources. They believed that fostering a sense of engagement among medical staff, especially physicians, is important.

1. Hydatid cyst disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus parasite, which affects canines and herbivores, and can accidentally infect humans through contaminated water, vegetables, or direct contact with infected dogs. The disease is common in many parts of the world, especially in countries where animal husbandry is prevalent. In endemic regions, the incidence rate can reach over 50 per 100,000 person-years, with a prevalence rate of 5-10% in humans. Iran is considered a hyper-endemic area due to its close relationship with animals and traditional animal husbandry practices.

2. The study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical status of human hydatidosis in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran, during 2011-2014. A total of 357 hydatid cyst cases were registered in health centers during this period, with the majority of cases found in the cities of Mashhad, Ghoochan, Neishabour, and Fariman. The mean age of women was higher than that of men, and 45.9% of patients had domestic dogs, while 64.4% washed vegetables with water alone. Only 6.7% of patients followed proper hygiene principles for washing vegetables.

3. The most common symptom of hydatidosis was abdominal pain, followed by hepatomegaly, chest pain, and cough. Liver involvement was reported in 59.4% of patients, and 8.4% had multiple organ involvement. The majority of patients (70.5%) were infected with a single cyst, and 24.5% had multiple cysts. The most common diagnosis methods were radiology and CT scan.

4. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies in Iran, which reported a higher proportion of hydatidosis in women than men, and a higher frequency of infection in housewives. The study highlights the need for educational programs to improve recognition of disease symptoms and identification of infection sources, particularly in high-risk groups. The prevalence of human hydatidosis should be considered by health policymakers in the public health domain.

1. Friederich is credited with describing the first case of a ciliated hepatic foregut cyst (CHFC) in 1857 and positing their congenital origin. Wheeler and Edmonson were the first to use the term CHFC to describe the lesion. They also identified specific characteristics that differentiate it from other hepatic cysts.

2. CHFCs are rare, with only 103 cases reported since they were first described as a congenital malformation by Friederich in 1857. The majority of these cases have been reported in the last 25 years as imaging techniques have improved. The term CHFC was coined to indicate the origin of this lesion as being a detached hepatic diverticulum or detachment and migration of buds from the oesophageal and bronchial regions of the foregut.

3. CHFCs are most frequently located superficially in the median segments of the liver (segments IV, V, VIII), are rarely multi-loculated or septated, and are mostly asymptomatic. They are found most commonly in segment IV of the left lobe just beneath the hepatic capsule. The cyst size ranges from <1 cm to 24 cm in greatest diameter.

4. The average age of presentation is 52 years, ranging from 3 months to 82 years, with a slight female predominance. Nearly 40% of the reported cases have been found incidentally on imaging studies, 26% incidentally at autopsy, 6% incidentally at surgery, and 22% presented with abdominal symptoms. CHFCs are thought to be the result of evagination of the foregut during embryonogenesis.

5. The imaging appearances of CHFCs are variable and appear as anechoic or hypoechoic cysts with spotty hyperechoic areas on ultrasound. CT findings are of a non-enhancing, rounded lesion of varying density depending on the contents of the cyst, which can include calcium crystals and cholesterol. Typical magnetic resonance imaging features are a hyperintense cyst on T2-weighted images and a variable appearance on T1-weighted images.

6. Pathologically, the cysts are typically solitary and unilocular, and have four layers: an outer fibrous rim, a layer of smooth muscle (often incomplete), subepithelial connective tissue, and a lining of ciliated, pseudo-stratified, mucin-secreting columnar epithelium.

1. The oral route is a preferred route of drug administration due to its safety, ease of administration, and acceptability by patients, with about 60% of conventional dosage forms available as oral solid dosage forms. However, the low bioavailability, longer onset of action, and dysphasia patients have led to the development of parenterals and liquid dosage forms.

2. Liquid dosage forms have the problem of accurate dosing, and parenterals are painful drug delivery systems, resulting in patient incompliance, whereas fast dissolving tablets have attracted attention due to their convenience. Fast dissolving tablets dissolve or disintegrate within 60 seconds when placed in the mouth without drinking water or chewing.

3. Clobazam is an ideal drug candidate for an orally dissolving strip formulation due to its indication in children and its low-dose requirement, and the formulation of clobazam as an orally dissolving strip would significantly facilitate dose administration. The orally dissolving strip of clobazam was prepared using polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and sodium starch glycolate (SSG) as film forming and disintegrating agents, respectively.

4. A 3 full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables PVA and SSG on the dependent variables like tensile strength, disintegration time, and in vitro drug release. The data was subjected to contour and 3D response surface plot using Design-Expert software version 8.0.7.1.

5. The surface morphology of the optimized orally dissolving strip formulation was observed with scanning electron microscopy, depicting a smooth surface with some little pores, indicating uniform distribution of drug particles. The optimized formulation was chosen for subsequent comparative study relative to a marketed clobazam formulation.

6. Comparative results of in vitro drug release of the optimized formulation and marketed formulation (Frisium 5) indicated that the optimized formulation was comparable to the marketed formulation. The results from the HPLC method validation in the rabbit plasma showed good precision and accuracy.

7. The mean clobazam plasma concentration-time profiles for the prepared orally dissolving strip and the marketed tablets were compared, and the statistical comparison of Cmax, AUC0t, and AUC0 indicated no significant difference between the two treatments. The 90% confidence intervals for the mean ratio (test/reference) of Cmax, AUC0t, and AUC0 were within the acceptable range.

1. Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, and it can result in significant long-term impact on individuals, including social isolation, mood disturbance, and reduction in mobility and life roles. Effective self-management practices are key to promoting recovery and improving health outcomes. However, the concept of self-management in stroke remains unclear, and there is a lack of consensus on the appropriate measures to evaluate stroke self-management interventions.

2. Self-management interventions are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively, and evaluation of these interventions relies on judgments concerning the process and outcome of self-management. The majority of measures used in stroke self-management interventions focus on health outcomes, such as physical functioning, mood, and quality of life. However, attitudes and behaviors, such as self-efficacy and healthcare utilization, are also important aspects of self-management.

3. The COSMIN checklist is a critical appraisal tool used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties. The checklist assesses nine properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and responsiveness. However, many measures used in stroke self-management interventions lack robust psychometric properties, and there is a need for further development and validation of measures.

4. The review found that 43 different outcome measures were used in stroke self-management interventions, but only 21 measures demonstrated some properties according to the COSMIN checklist. The majority of measures scored poorly on the checklist, and there was a lack of consensus on the appropriate measures to use. Further research is needed to develop and validate measures that capture the concept of stroke self-management.

5. Physical function was the most commonly used indicator of effective self-management, but this may not be a robust indicator, as it does not capture the full range of self-management strategies. There is a need to further conceptualize stroke self-management and develop measures that capture the patient experience. The role of physical function in stroke self-management requires further clarification.

6. The review found that many measures were developed without involvement of the target population, which can limit their validity and relevance. Measures developed with user involvement are more likely to capture what is meaningful to patients and enhance content validity. There is a need for further research to develop measures that are sensitive to change and capture the patient experience.

1. Osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee joint is a leading cause of functional disability and lowered quality of life in older adults in India. The severity of OA is influenced by factors such as age, height, weight, and BMI. Physiotherapists use self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor prognosis and achieve rehabilitative goals.

2. Self-reported questionnaires, such as WOMAC, SF-36, and KOOS, provide subjective information about the disease process without examiner bias, while performance-based tests, such as the timed up and go test and six-minute walk test, objectively measure a patient's ability to perform daily activities. Physical performance tests are affected by motivation and not affected by psychogenic factors. Performance-based tests measure functional limitation, whereas self-reported questionnaires reveal disability.

3. The primary objective of the present study was to correlate the subjectively measured KOOS questionnaire with the objectively measured 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), age, height, weight, and BMI. The study included 251 patients with clinical and nonradiographic idiopathic or primary knee OA. The KOOS questionnaire consists of 42 questions addressing five patient-related domains, including pain, symptoms, activity of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life.

4. The results of the study showed a weak correlation between 6-MWT and KOOS-ADL, and strong correlations between 6-MWT and KOOS-symptom, KOOS-pain, and KOOS-sports. BMI had a strong correlation with KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptom, KOOS-ADL, and KOOS-sports, and a very strong correlation with KOOS-QOL. Weight had a weak correlation with KOOS-symptom, KOOS-ADL, and KOOS-sports, and a strong correlation with KOOS-pain and KOOS-QOL.

5. The study found no correlation between age and any of the KOOS subscales except for age and KOOS-QOL. The results are in agreement with previous studies that reported strong correlations between timed up and go (TUG) and all subscales of KOOS. The study's findings are also consistent with previous studies that reported correlations between WOMAC and 5-MWT, and between WOMAC and physical performance tests.

6. The study's results confirm the usage of KOOS in Indian OA knee patients and support the importance of using both self-reported and performance-based tests in knee",0

1. The study investigated the effects of a high-fat diet and ovariectomy on body weight, metabolic efficiency, and cytokine content in female rats, and found that the combination of the two led to increased body weight gain, food efficiency, and carcass lipid content.
2. The study also found that ovariectomy combined with a high-fat diet caused hyperleptinemia, which may contribute to the induction of proinflammatory processes, particularly those associated with a high-fat diet.
3. The cytokine content of the liver and gastrocnemius muscle was not altered by the high-fat diet and ovariectomy, but a decrease in all analyzed cytokines was observed in mesenteric adipose tissue.
4. The results of the study suggest that women, especially after menopause, should decrease their consumption of fat to prevent weight gain and metabolic disorders.",1

1. Hemoptysis is a common symptom in patients with respiratory diseases, and massive hemoptysis has a high mortality rate of over 50%. Therefore, quick treatment is necessary to stop bleeding.

2. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is a safe and effective treatment for massive hemoptysis, as well as chronic or recurrent hemoptysis that impairs the patient's quality of life. The first step in BAE is a complete angiography of the pulmonary vascular tree.

3. This retrospective study analyzed 344 patients who underwent BAE at Tianjin Haihe Hospital between 2006 and 2013. The patients were hospitalized due to hemoptysis, with a volume of blood ranging from 50-2000 ml/24h.

4. The patients' ages ranged from 17 to 83 years old, with a mean age of 57 years old. There were 186 men and 158 women, with 234 patients having acute and massive hemoptysis and 110 patients having chronic and recurrent hemoptysis.

5. The etiologies of hemoptysis included tuberculosis (55.2%), bronchiectasis (28.8%), malignancy (5.8%), undefined (5.2%), pneumonia (1.8%), deformity of bronchial artery (1.8%), bronchial artery aneurysm (0.2%), and other pulmonary disease (1.2%). BAE was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 330 of 344 patients (96%).

6. Recurrent hemoptysis occurred in 61 patients (17.7%) within 1 month after undergoing BAE, and 74 patients (21.5%) had recurrent hemoptysis over 1 month after undergoing BAE. Forty-four patients underwent repeated embolization, and 27 patients developed new blood vessels responsible for hemorrhage.

7. The complications of BAE included fever (31.1%), chest pain (18.9%), back pain (14.8%), shoulder pain (8.4%), and transient dysphagia or lower limb numbness (0.9%). All patients had been followed up over 1 month after BAE except for four patients who died within 1 month.

8. The follow-up of patients revealed that 28 patients had died, six from massive hemorrhage and the remainder from their disease process. Twenty-one patients had recurrent hemoptysis after repeated BAE, with a volume of bleeding < 5",0

1. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) in pediatric patients with lymphocytic gastritis (LG). LG is a condition characterized by an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the gastric mucosa. The study included 40 patients, divided into four groups: controls, CD patients without HP infection, HP-infected patients without CD, and CD patients with HP infection. The diagnosis of CD was based on histological findings and positive serology.

2. The study found that the highest prevalence of LG was in pediatric CD patients with HP infection, followed by CD patients without HP infection. The number of IELs was significantly higher in CD patients with or without HP infection compared to controls. The distribution and total number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum were highest in HP-infected patients, regardless of CD status. The mean number of CD3+ IELs was increased in CD patients with or without HP infection compared to controls.

3. The study also found that CD8+ IELs were significantly higher in CD patients compared to controls or HP-infected patients without CD. The number of CD8+ IELs may imply that the diagnosis is CD rather than HP gastritis. The expression of CD57 in lymphoid cells was low, indicating that natural killer cells may play a negligible role in these pathologies. The proliferation marker Ki67 did not show an increase in the proliferation index of the surface epithelium in these pathologies.

4. The study concluded that the characterization of the immunophenotype of gastric mucosa in CD and HP infection may help in differentiating between these two diseases. The number of CD8+ IELs in the antrum may hint towards the diagnosis of CD rather than HP infection. The number of lymphoid follicles directs towards the diagnosis of HP infection. The study suggests that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum should be included in undefined cases of CD.",1

1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is essential for the growth of solid tumors, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a primary stimulant of angiogenesis. VEGF binds and activates VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2, promoting vascular permeability and metastasis.

2. Inhibiting angiogenesis with drugs could be an important tool in cancer treatment, as it occurs at high levels during fetal development, the menstrual cycle, and in wound healing, making it a low-toxicity target. Anti-angiogenic treatments should not directly attack cancer cells, but rather target normal processes controlled by normal cells.

3. VEGF is a critical target for cancer therapy, and its inhibition has been shown to reduce tumor growth and microvessel density in breast cancer models. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human VEGF, is approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/neu-negative breast cancer.

4. Anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab, 2C3, or R84 inhibits the growth of established orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, reduces tumor microvessel density, and limits the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages. Selective inhibition of VEGFR2 with an anti-VEGF antibody is sufficient for effective blockade of the protumorigenic activity of VEGF in breast cancer xenografts.

5. Inhibition of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 by 2C3 has been shown to reduce tumor size in pancreatic and breast tumors, and chronic treatment with R84, 2C3, or bevacizumab significantly reduces tumor growth in an orthotopic human breast cancer xenograft model. The effect of R84, 2C3, and bevacizumab on MDA-MB-231 tumor growth in vivo is due to the block of VEGF activation of tumor cells.

6. VEGF is an abundant cytokine in the tumor microenvironment, stimulating immune cell chemotaxis, and inhibitors of VEGF have been shown to reduce macrophage infiltration in orthotopic pancreatic cancer models.

1. Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common medical condition in postmenopausal women, affecting an estimated 32 million women in the US. It is a chronic and progressive condition that will not resolve on its own without treatment.

2. The REVIVE survey found that many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its associated symptoms, with only about one-quarter of women identifying menopause as the cause of their symptoms. Most women were unaware that their vaginal symptoms could be caused by menopause or hormonal changes.

3. The survey also found that almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP), and 40% of women expected their HCP to initiate the conversation. Many women assumed that their symptoms were a natural part of aging or were not bothersome enough to warrant discussion.

4. The most commonly reported VVA symptoms among postmenopausal women were vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and local irritation, which can negatively impact women's quality of life, including sexual relationships and emotional well-being. VVA can also affect other aspects of life, such as clothing choices, exercise options, and general pelvic floor comfort.

5. The use of VVA-specific treatments was reported by 40% of participants, with over-the-counter (OTC) products being used by 67% of those who ever used a treatment, and vaginal estrogen therapies being used by 27%. However, many women were dissatisfied with their current treatments, citing inadequate symptom relief, inconvenience, and dislike of the accommodations needed for vaginal administration.

6. The survey found that many women who had been given a clinical diagnosis of VVA were not using any treatment for their symptoms, with 27% not using any treatment and 33% having stopped using treatment. Only 35% of postmenopausal women currently on any treatment for VVA were satisfied with their current treatment.

7. Women who remained untreated despite a diagnosis of VVA cited safety concerns, concerns about hormone exposure, and feeling that their symptoms were not bothersome enough to warrant treatment. Many women also discontinued treatment due to concerns about side effects, messiness, or lack of efficacy.

8. The survey highlighted the need for better communication between women and their HCPs about VVA and its treatment options. HCPs can facilitate open communication by normalizing the conversation, commenting that VVA is a common medical condition that most postmenopausal women experience",0

1. The study examined the prevalence of folic acid (FA) and multivitamin (MV) supplement use among 5383 Danish pregnancy planners. The participants were recruited through an internet-based prospective cohort study, and data were collected through self-administered questionnaires. The study found that 62.1% of the participants used FA or MV supplements, with 7.7% using FA exclusively, 20.4% using MV exclusively, and 34.0% using both. The prevalence of FA or MV use was higher than in previous studies.

2. The study found that higher age, higher education, and higher income were associated with increased prevalence of FA or MV use. Women who finished high school were more likely to use FA or MVs compared to those with less schooling. Similarly, women with a long vocational training (>4 years) were more likely to use FA or MVs compared to those with no vocational training. Women with a higher income (>65,000 DKK/month) were also more likely to use FA or MVs.

3. The study found that women who had a previous spontaneous abortion were more likely to use FA or MVs, and those who had a higher frequency of intercourse were also more likely to use FA or MVs. Women who had a pap smear in the last 3 years were more likely to use FA or MVs compared to those who did not. However, there was no clear association between months attempting to conceive and FA or MV use.

4. The study found that women who engaged in physical activity were more likely to use FA or MVs, and those who were overweight or obese were less likely to use FA or MVs. Women who smoked were also less likely to use FA or MVs, and those who consumed high amounts of alcohol were less likely to use FA or MVs. There was no clear association between a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, or infections with chlamydia and preconceptional use of FA or MVs.

5. The study's findings indicate that more than one-third of the pregnancy planners did not follow the preconceptional FA recommendation. The study highlights the need to target women at high risk of not following the FA recommendation, as well as those not following other preconceptional guidelines. The study's results can inform public health strategies to improve preconceptional care and reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and predictors",0

1. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a condition that results from the narrowing of arteries in the lower extremities due to atherosclerosis, and it is a predictor of substantial coronary and cerebral vascular risk. The most common symptomatic manifestation of mild to moderate atherosclerotic PAD is intermittent claudication, observed in approximately 5% of individuals older than 60 years.

2. Oxidative stress, through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is involved in the development and progression of PAD, and risk factors associated with PAD include high blood concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs, have pleiotropic effects, including improving endothelial function, reducing oxidative stress, and affecting lipid metabolism enzyme activities.

3. The aim of the present study was to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of patients with PAD before surgery as well as 35 days and 710 days after surgery, and to compare these parameters with those in a group of patients receiving simvastatin therapy. The study group consisted of PAD patients, treated either surgically or pharmacologically, and blood samples were collected before surgery as well as 35 days and 710 days after surgical treatment.

4. The results showed that the concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly higher in the surgical group before surgery than those in the group on simvastatin therapy. The surgical group had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), in comparison to those treated pharmacologically.

5. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as FRAP) and -SH group concentrations in the serum of patients on statin therapy and in those before surgery were similar, but a decrease was observed in FRAP level 35 days after surgery, and 710 days after surgery, it was significantly lower in comparison to the values before surgery and on simvastatin therapy. Thiol group concentrations 35 days postoperatively were lower than those before surgery and 710 days after surgery and were lower than those in patients treated with simvastatin.

6. The study's findings support the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation may be one mechanism through which several risk factors may promote PAD, and statin therapy relieves symptoms and improves function in patients with lower extremity PAD. The results provide strong support for the efficacy of statin therapy in PAD and suggest that simvastatin may be implicated in antioxidant properties",1

1. The demand for herbal remedies in Nigeria has been increasing, but there is a lack of scientific data to support their medicinal claims, and their safety and validity need to be assessed. The popular belief that herbal remedies are natural and without adverse effects has contributed to their widespread use.

2. The Fijk herbal remedy is a mixture of 13 medicinal plants and is indicated for the treatment of various ailments, but there is no scientific data to support its medicinal benefits or potential toxicity. A search of online research libraries revealed no scientific data on the Fijk herbal remedy.

3. The study aimed to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to Fijk on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology. The rats were divided into four groups and received different dosages of Fijk, and their body weights, liver weights, and plasma biochemical indices were measured.

4. The results showed that the oral administration of Fijk did not produce significant changes in rat body weights, but caused significant reductions in rat plasma protein levels and alterations in lipid profiles. The exposure to Fijk also caused significant elevations in rat plasma triglyceride levels and atherogenic index.

5. The study also found that the oral administration of Fijk caused significant increases in rat plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, indicating liver injury. The levels of rat plasma alkaline phosphatase were also significantly reduced, indicating inactivation or decreased protein synthesis.

6. The light microscopic examination of rat liver sections revealed morphological lesions, including hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, hyperemia, and inflammation, indicating hepatic injury caused by oral and repeated exposure to Fijk. The study suggests that the use of Fijk herbal remedy may pose health risks to consumers, particularly with regards to cardiovascular and liver health.",1

1. Identifying carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders before pregnancy can benefit prospective parents by allowing them to make informed reproductive decisions. Carrier screening and carrier testing are two approaches to identifying carriers, with carrier screening detecting carrier status in individuals without an a priori increased risk. Carrier testing, on the other hand, is offered to individuals with a higher a priori risk based on their or their partner's personal or family history. The goal of preconceptional carrier screening is to strengthen reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.

2. Preconceptional carrier screening has been extensively studied for cystic fibrosis (CF) and has revealed positive attitudes towards CF carrier screening from healthcare providers, patients, and the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) have recommended preconceptional carrier screening for CF. Despite this, screening is not currently offered in most countries, and carrier testing is usually restricted to families and partners of CF patients and carriers.

3. Commercial companies have started offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers, providing information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring. These direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests raise concerns about the desirability of these activities, including the validity and utility of tests offered, the absence of individualized medical supervision, and the lack of an adequate consent procedure. The availability of DTC genetic tests has created a huge debate about their desirability. Various concerns were raised with regard to the commercial DTC offer of genetic tests.

4. The Health Council of the Netherlands has emphasized the need for criteria for a responsible offer of genetic DTC screening, including the need for informed consent, medical supervision, and the appropriate use of existing resources. The large number of monogenic disorders included in DTC genetic testing companies' services challenges established specifications for carrier testing, including the condition being an important health problem and the test having a known predictive value. The universal carrier test offered by Counsyl, for example, raises questions about whether DTC carrier testing should be seen as an activity for which these screening criteria are applicable.

5. The inclusion of a large number of disorders in DTC test panels raises concerns about the consistency of the panel and the potential for false positives. The clinical utility of testing for some disorders is debatable, and the question is raised of whether good information and informed decision-making are still possible",0

1. The study investigated the common indications for removal of internal fixation devices and highlighted potential issues. The majority of patients who needed removal of implants were men (85.5%), and the mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher (49.33 years) than those with pain (31.6 years) or implant failure (35 years). Implant-associated pain or discomfort was the most common reason necessitating removal (39.75%).

2. The next most common indication was implant infection (about 29%), and some patients had been treated non-operatively for varying lengths of time to control the infection but without success. Implant failure was the next most common indication in symptomatic patients, and reasons for failure of the implant include faulty implant, faulty operative technique, inadequate implant, delayed healing, and patient noncompliance. The incidence of infections is likely to rise as more operations are performed and longevity increases.

3. The study found that carefully done, the removal should be a safe procedure, and there is a low but definite possibility of complications. The average duration of hospital stay in patients with pain or discomfort was 5 days, and at 4 months follow-up, 15 patients out of 34 reported complete relief of pain (44.11%). The study is limited by a small sample size and a short follow-up period, and more studies with greater number of cases and wider study dimensions are needed to produce concrete literature on the patterns of removal surgeries in symptomatic implants.",1

1. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy, and multiple factors are related to its development, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
2. Müller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, play an important physiological role and are involved in multiple pathological retinal diseases, including glaucoma.
3. The study aimed to determine if -aminoadipic acid (AAA) treatment inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities induced in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
4. The results showed that AAA treatment attenuated the apoptotic death of RGCs and rescued the reduced number of RGCs in the AOH model, demonstrating protective effects on AOH retinas.
5. Activated Müller cells contribute to the progression of glaucoma, and AAA treatment attenuated Müller cell gliosis and reduced retinal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in the AOH model.
6. The study suggested that AAA promoted survival of RGCs in the AOH model, likely through the inhibition of AOH-induced Müller cell gliosis and downregulation of TNF-α protein production.
7. The findings indicated that AAA might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodegeneration in glaucoma.

1. Endoscopic resection can be a curative procedure for superficial duodenal neoplasms (SDNs), but it is technically challenging and carries a high risk of severe adverse events, including delayed perforation.
2. Laparoscopic and/or endoscopic full-thickness resection (FTR) has been reported as a useful technique for treating nonampullary SDNs, but it is associated with the possibility of intraperitoneal tumor dissemination.
3. The authors developed an alternative FTR method, called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L), to minimize the risk of tumor dissemination.
4. Five patients underwent resection of nonampullary SDNs using LAEFTR-L, and the procedure was completed in a closed manner without complications.
5. The mean operative time was 173 minutes, and the mean diameter of the resected specimen was 24 mm, with complete resection achieved in all cases.
6. LAEFTR-L has two advantages over conventional FTR procedures: the resected specimen can be collected intraluminally, avoiding contact with the peritoneum, and it does not require proficient experience in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
7. Tumor size and location are important factors to consider when deciding on the indication for LAEFTR-L, with lesions smaller than 15 mm in diameter and located away from the ampulla of Vater being potential candidates.

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive conditions caused by defects in enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). This deficiency leads to signs and symptoms of androgen excess, including ambiguous genitalia in females and rapid somatic growth with accelerated skeletal maturation in both sexes. The clinical course of CAH has improved significantly since the discovery of cortisone in the 1950s. Typical medical treatment consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens.

2. The pathophysiology of CAH due to 21-OHD is closely linked to the degree of enzyme deficiency, leading to a state of hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism combined with catecholamine deficiency and several metabolic disturbances. The biosynthesis of cortisol is regulated by negative feedback on hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. A defect in cortisol biosynthesis leads to a compensatory increase in hypothalamic and pituitary secretion of CRH and ACTH, stimulating the adrenal cortex and resulting in hyperplastic adrenal glands. The consequence of 21-OHD is a state of hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism, and hyperandrogenism combined with catecholamine deficiency and several metabolic disturbances.

3. CAH can be classified as classic or non-classic, with classic CAH subclassified as salt-losing or non-salt-losing (simple virilizing). Non-classic CAH may be asymptomatic or associated with signs of androgen excess developing during childhood or at puberty. The classic forms are characterized by a congenital decrease of cortisol and aldosterone secretion and an increase in androgen biosynthesis. All female infants with classic CAH due to 21-OHD typically have ambiguous genitalia at birth because of exposure to high concentrations of androgens in the uterus.

4. The development of adrenal adenoma or carcinoma in patients with CAH is rare, but the incidence of adrenal masses appears to be higher in CAH patients and in heterozygotes than in the general population. Recent reports have revealed a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH. Histological types of adrenal tumor",0

1. The study examined the relationship between dietary and physical activity behaviors and self-rated health (SRH) in a population of adults from Miami-Dade County, Florida, with a majority of Hispanics and a considerable proportion of Blacks. The study found that participants who reported lower fruits and vegetables intake and higher fatty-food intake were more likely to report poor/fair SRH. Females who consumed 2 servings of fruits and vegetables per day were 2.1 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH compared to those who consumed 5 servings per day. Similarly, males who consumed 3-4 servings of fruits and vegetables per day were 2.8 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH compared to those who consumed 5 servings per day.

2. The study also found that participants who consumed mostly high-fat foods were more likely to report poor/fair SRH compared to those who consumed primarily low-fat foods. Females who consumed mostly high-fat foods were 1.5 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH, while males who consumed mostly high-fat foods were 3.2 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown a positive association between high-fat intake and poor SRH. The results suggest that reducing fat intake may be an important strategy for improving SRH.

3. Physical activity was also found to be associated with SRH, with females who reported less physical activity being more likely to report poor/fair SRH. Females who performed 13 times a month or never of physical activity were 1.6 times more likely to report poor/fair SRH compared to those who performed 5 days per week of physical activity. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown a positive association between physical activity and SRH. The results suggest that increasing physical activity may be an important strategy for improving SRH, particularly among females.

4. The study's findings have implications for designing and monitoring lifestyle interventions to prevent cardiovascular diseases. The results suggest that targeting modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as increasing fruits and vegetables intake, reducing fat intake, and increasing physical activity may be effective in improving SRH. The study's findings also highlight the importance of considering gender differences in the design and implementation of lifestyle interventions. Overall, the study's results provide valuable insights into the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and SRH, and suggest that promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors may be an important strategy for improving health outcomes.",1

1. The endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DX/HA) has become a popular treatment option for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) due to its minimally invasive nature, short procedure time, and low complication rate. The American Urological Association has recognized DX/HA injection as an option for managing pediatric VUR.

3. Intraoperative cystography, including positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography, can detect occult VUR and predict surgical outcome, but its correlation with postoperative cystograms is limited, and it cannot replace postoperative studies. PIC cystography can, however, detect de novo contralateral VUR in patients with preoperative unilateral reflux and prevent postoperative contralateral new onset of VUR.",1

1. The accuracy of detecting fetal pathology using ultrasound depends on the expertise of the sonographer and is limited by factors such as maternal obesity and oligohydramnios. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies, particularly in cases of central nervous system pathology. MRI has excellent contrast resolution, allowing for easy differentiation between gray and white matter, and can directly visualize the cortical region and fossa posterior without sonographic limitations.

2. The added value of MRI in detecting and characterizing additional cerebral anomalies in cases of ventriculomegaly is significant, particularly in moderate and severe cases. MRI can detect small deposits of intraventricular blood, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and cortical anomalies, and is useful in assessing the fossa posterior and detecting developmental anomalies. The excellent tissue contrast of MRI makes it ideal for cortical evaluation, and it is also useful in detecting pathological white matter changes and cortical malformations in cases of congenital infections.",1

1. The study analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and Medicare claims to investigate the impact of bone metastasis on mortality in lung cancer patients aged 65 and older. The study found that 19.8% of patients had evidence of bone metastasis, and 51% of those with bone metastasis had skeletal-related events (SREs). The most common SRE was radiotherapy to bone, followed by fracture, spinal cord compression, and surgery to bone. The spine was the most common site of pathological fracture.

2. The study found that having a bone metastasis was associated with mortality among lung cancer patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.4. The association was similar for bone metastasis complicated by SRE and bone metastasis without SRE. The study also found that the association between bone metastasis and mortality was stronger for patients with localized stage lung cancer than for those with distant metastatic lung cancer at diagnosis. The study's results were consistent with previous studies that found a high prevalence of bone metastasis in lung cancer patients.

3. The study used a large population-based cancer registry data with pathologically confirmed cancer and focused on lung cancer in the elderly. The combined cancer registry and Medicare data provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the clinical progress of lung cancer. The study's strengths included the use of high-quality data and the ability to evaluate the clinical progress of lung cancer. However, the study was limited to patients aged 65 and older diagnosed with lung cancer between 1999 and 2005.

4. The study's limitations included the characteristics of the SEER-Medicare data, which did not include claims of health maintenance organization enrollees, care provided in other settings, or reimbursement of covered services not captured by the Medicare data. The study's results may not be generalizable to patients less than 65 years of age and may not represent patients aged 65 years and older who resided in geographic areas not included in the SEER program. The study did not validate the procedures used to identify bone metastasis, which may have resulted in false positives or false negatives.

5. The study's findings have implications for the treatment and management of lung cancer patients with bone metastasis. The study's results suggest that bone metastasis is a significant predictor of mortality in lung cancer patients and that SREs are common among patients with bone metastasis. The study's findings may inform the development of treatment strategies that target bone metastasis",0

1. The study compared the effect of different smear layer removal methods on the bond strength of self-adhesive cements used with fiber posts. The methods used were physiological saline, sodium hypochlorite, EDTA, orthophosphoric acid, and photodynamic diode laser. The results showed that the photodynamic diode laser and orthophosphoric acid groups had higher bond strength values than the other groups.

2. The study found that the smear layer removal methods affected the bond strength of the fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin. The null hypothesis was rejected, and the results showed that the photodynamic diode laser group had higher bond strength without removing the smear layer. The laser treatment may have improved the infiltration of the luting agent by conserving the collagen fibrils structure.

3. The study concluded that the photodynamic diode laser and orthophosphoric acid were more effective at the cement-dentin interface than EDTA for bond strength of self-adhesive cements. The results suggest that modifying the smear layer may be more effective when a self-adhesive system is used. The study's findings can be useful in improving the bonding effectiveness of resin and dentin for post restoration success.",1

1. The human gut microbiome has been extensively studied in recent years, with international consortia and collaborations established to identify, describe, and quantify the bacterial communities. The Human Microbiome Project in the USA and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives. These projects aim to characterize the microbial communities that inhabit multiple sites in the human body and look for correlations between changes in the microbiome and the prevalence of diseases.

2. The gut microbiome is established at birth, with the first acquisition of bacteria occurring in the birth canal and through breast milk. The microbial composition changes with age and diet, and studies have shown that the character of gut microbiota strongly depends on the main nutritional source, separating bacterial profiles of omnivores, carnivores, and herbivores. Each individual carries around 500,000 bacterially encoded genes, among which the majority are rare genes shared by less than half of the group sampled.

3. The concept of enterotypes has been proposed, where the combination of microbes in each individual appears to be systematically organized into clusters. Three enterotypes have been identified, each with unique properties and functions. Enterotype 1 is dominated by Bacteroides, enterotype 2 is driven by Prevotella, and enterotype 3 is enriched in Ruminococcus. The current definition of enterotypes will likely undergo further refinement over the next few years.

4. The role of the microbiota in regulation of host energy balance and metabolism can be studied at various levels. Germ-free mice have been used to study the effects of the microbiota on host physiology, and introduction of a semi-synthetic high-fat diet (HFD) has been shown to induce weight gain and metabolic diseases. The composition of the bacterial flora can then be monitored simultaneously with changes in the animal's body weight.

5. The shift from Bacteroidetes towards Firmicutes has been observed in mice and humans, accompanied by a general decline in microbial diversity. This shift is probably responsible for the observed increase in abundance of bacterial genes involved in sugar metabolism. The phenotype was somewhat transferable, with wild-type germ-free mice colonized with flora from ob/ob mice or mice that received HFD being better at storing fat compared to those colonized with a normal flora.

1. Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail, characterized by nail discoloration, thickening, and defect, and is often caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophytes.
2. The treatment of onychomycosis is challenging due to the slow nail growth, physical presence of the nail plate, and difficulty in finding compounds with adequate pharmacologic profile for nail penetration.
3. In this study, topical treatment with tazarotene 0.1% gel showed complete healing in all patients after 12 weeks, with a rapid and progressive amelioration of all evaluated clinical parameters, and no side effects except for mild erythema on the perionychia in two patients.
4. Tazarotene demonstrated fungistatic activity in vitro against T. mentagrophytes, T. verrucosum, C. albicans, and C. glabrata, supporting its direct action on fungus replication.
5. The study suggests that tazarotene could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of onychomycosis, particularly in patients with treatment-resistant forms or evident enhanced nail thickening.",1

1. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an important treatment for patients with heart failure and left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, but clinical non-response to CRT is reported in 25-35% of patients. The study aimed to investigate the acute haemodynamic response to endocardial LV pacing in patients who were non-responders to CRT.

2. The study included 24 patients who remained in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV despite at least 6 months of CRT and adequate medical therapy. The patients underwent an acute haemodynamic study to assess the response to endocardial LV pacing.

3. In 5 out of 24 patients, the LVdp/dtmax with the implanted coronary sinus system increased ≥15% after optimization, and in 3 of these patients, endocardial pacing did not increase the LVdp/dtmax substantially. In one patient, the acute haemodynamic response (AHR) could be increased during LV endocardial pacing from 19.7% to 25.8%.

4. The results of the total group of 24 patients showed a positive response in 11 patients with an apical lead position in 7, anterolateral in 2, and mid-posterolateral in 2 patients. A negative response of endocardial pacing was observed in 13 patients with a basal posterolateral lead position in 3, mid-posterolateral in 8, and apical in 2 patients.

5. In 5 out of the 9 acute haemodynamic non-responders (AHR <15%) with left bundle branch block (LBBB), the AHR could be increased above the 15% level by LV endocardial pacing. The average AHR with the coronary sinus system was 9.6% and at the LV endocardial optimal position was 25.8%.

6. Ten patients were considered possible candidates for LV endocardial pacing, and 5 of them finally agreed to LV endocardial implant at the optimal LV site as indicated from the acute study, resulting in clinical improvement with a reduction of at least 1 class in the NYHA score after 6 months of follow-up.",0

1. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects 1 in every 500 to 1 in every 1000 individuals and is found in all racial and ethnic groups. The disease may not be clinically apparent until the third or fourth decade of life, and only about half of the patients will progress to renal failure.

2. In young patients, there is no way to predict whether or when renal failure will develop, although several risk factors have been associated with a more rapid course. Complications associated with pregnant subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis include maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, and infected renal and hepatic cysts.

3. A 35-year-old full-term primigravida with oligohydramnios was scheduled for emergency lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) due to ADPKD diagnosed in the seventh month of pregnancy. She was hospitalized and hemodialyzed thrice a week for two months to maintain blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and potassium values within acceptable limits.

4. The patient's clinical parameters were stable, with a heart rate of 102/min, systemic blood pressure of 120/74 mmHg, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 1-2 cm H2O. Preoperative investigations showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.2 gm%, normal leucocyte count, and mild proteinurea and pus cells in urine.

5. The patient's biochemical profile revealed BUN of 30 mg/dl, serum creatinine 3.7 mg%, serum sodium 140 mmol/L, serum potassium 5 mmol/L, and normal liver function tests. Coagulation profile was normal, with bleeding time 3 min, clotting time 9 min, and platelet count 150 x 10^9/L.

1. The study analyzed the lactation curve of Karan Fries cows to predict milk yield and identify the effects of mastitis on milk production. The data consisted of 11,728 fortnightly test-day milk yields from 733 cows over 12 years. The lactation curve was composed using a gamma type function to predict milk yield with minimum error. The study aimed to find the accuracy of the model in predicting milk yield in normal and mastitis-affected cows.

2. The results showed that the fortnightly test-day milk yield increased till the 3rd or 4th fortnight and then declined steadily with the advancement of lactation. The peak milk yield was attained in the 3rd fortnight in mastitis cows and in the 3rd and 4th fortnights in normal cows. The cows in the first parity took more time to attain peak yield compared to subsequent parities. The peak yield was minimum in the 1st parity and maximum in the 4th parity in both normal and mastitis cows.

3. The lactation curve parameters, including initial milk yield, ascending slope, and descending slope, were estimated for each parity. The initial milk yield was higher in normal cows than in mastitis cows in different parities. The peak milk yield was observed in the 4th parity, while the minimum yield was observed in the 1st parity in both normal and mastitis cows. The descending slope parameter was lower in the 1st parity and higher in the 4th parity in normal cows.

4. The study found that the persistency of lactation was higher in the 1st parity and declined till the 5th and above parity in all cows. The fortnights of peak milk yield ranged from 4.53 to 6.15 fortnights in normal cows and from 4.49 to 5.88 fortnights in mastitis cows. The coefficient of determination of variation ranged from 84.88% to 98.18% in normal cows and from 83.93% to 97.68% in mastitis cows during different parities. The RMSE value was minimum in the 3rd parity and maximum in the 5th and above parity in normal cows.

1. The study investigated the effects of Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on the lifespan of mice and flies. The mice were fed NDGA at different concentrations, and their lifespan, weight, and food consumption were monitored. The results showed that NDGA extended the median lifespan of mice by 12% at a concentration of 373mg/kg body weight/day. However, higher and lower concentrations did not have a significant effect on lifespan.

2. The study also found that NDGA consumption was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis in mice. The drug did not appear to affect energy uptake or utilization in flies, unlike in mice. The results suggest that the target(s) and mechanism(s) of action of NDGA may be phylogenetically conserved between mice and flies. However, the response in flies was unlike that in mice in some aspects.

3. The study's findings are consistent with previous reports that NDGA can extend lifespan, but the doses that extend lifespan appear to overlap with those that produce serious pathologies. In humans, NDGA has been shown to suppress signaling through the IGF1R and to suppress the androgen-stimulated growth of human prostate cancer cells in culture. However, NDGA has also been associated with toxic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fulminant liver failure in humans. The development of less toxic derivatives of NDGA is underway for potential use as cancer therapeutics.

4. The mechanisms by which NDGA extends lifespan are not fully understood, but may involve inhibition of mTORC1 activity, suppression of growth factor signaling, and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. However, the data are inconsistent with the extension of lifespan through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. The study's findings suggest that NDGA may have both positive and negative effects on health, and further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses.",0

1. Genetic variation contributes to disease susceptibility and treatment response, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the discovery of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. Personalized medicine aims to improve medical decision-making by identifying the optimal drug and dosage for individual patients. Biomarkers play a crucial role in personalized medicine, and their use can lead to withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options. The term ""personalized medicine"" is often limited to identifying the optimal drug and dosage, but it can also include situations where treatment is delayed or not given.

2. Biomarkers are defined as substances or biological structures that can be measured in the human body and may influence or predict disease incidence or outcome. There are different types of biomarkers, including DNA biomarkers, DNA tumor biomarkers, and general biomarkers, each with its own characteristics and applications. DNA biomarkers are stable over an individual's lifetime and can be used in both prospective and retrospective studies. They are generally measured in the blood and can be used for therapy monitoring, pharmacodynamics, or as surrogate markers.

3. Diagnostic biomarkers are used to determine the diagnosis or severity of a disease, and screening biomarkers are used to discriminate between healthy individuals and those in an early stage of disease. Prognostic biomarkers predict the likely course of disease in a defined clinical population under standard treatment conditions. Predictive biomarkers predict the likely response of a patient to a special treatment in terms of efficacy and/or safety. Examples of biomarkers in current use include the Blueprint DNA tumor biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and the EGFR DNA tumor biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer.

4. The development of diagnostic tests undergoes a similar process to drug development, with phases I-IV involving discovery, assay development, retrospective validation, prospective investigation, and health economics studies. The phase concept is oriented towards marketing approval of diagnostic agents, and an extended phase approach is more helpful for diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. The discovery phase involves identifying promising biomarkers, and the assay development phase involves defining and optimizing the analytical process.

5. The retrospective validation phase involves detecting disease and developing an algorithm for combination tests, and the prospective investigation phase involves determining diagnostic accuracy in clinical routine. The randomized controlled trial phase involves quantifying the effect of making biomarker information available to doctors to reduce disease burden. The health economics study phase involves quantifying the cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic test. The use of biobanks for prospective validation is complex and requires proper definition of standards.

1. Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. The motor's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms.
3. The flexural stiffness of MyoVa subdomains was measured using tethered particle microscopy (TPM) by attaching a visible particle to a desired location along the motor.
4. The TPM method involves anchoring a MyoVa-actin complex to a microscope slide and then attaching a fluorescent quantum dot (Qdot) to a desired location along the motor.
5. The motion of the Qdot was measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered Qdot to a stationary, reference Qdot.
6. The flexural stiffness of the lever arm was estimated to be 0.0346 pN/nm, which is critical to the motor's processive movement.
7. The addition of calcium led to a 40% reduction in lever arm flexural stiffness, indicating that calmodulin dissociation from the lever arm may render it highly compliant.
8. The distal rod domain was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, and the lever arm/rod junction was found to be highly compliant.

1. The study aimed to determine if clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The study included 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped.

2. The associations between the SNPs and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients with EAC or ESCC. However, multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between DFS and two SNPs in patients with EAC.

3. Patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype. The post-operative TNM stage of the tumor and the radicality of resection were also found to be important factors for DFS. The MDM2 protein is a nuclear phosphoprotein that binds and inhibits the tumor suppressor TP53.

4. The MDM2 T/G genotype was associated with improved survival in patients with EAC, which is contrary to expectations. A possible explanation is that the tumors of most patients with the T/T genotype harbor a TP53 mutation, which could lead to reduced survival. The TP53 status was not associated with breast cancer survival among carriers of the variant MDM2 allele.

5. Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type G/G genotype. The -347 G/A insertion polymorphism located in the promoter of the CDH1 gene has been reported to suppress CDH1 gene expression and was found to be associated with familial gastric cancer and sporadic colorectal cancer.

6. The GA-allele has been associated with significant suppression of CDH1 promoter activity in colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines. It can be hypothesized that the GA-allele might enhance the progression of esophageal cancer by reducing CDH1 transcription resulting in a decrease in CDH",0

1. The oral cavity is colonized by Candida albicans or other Candida species in 40-60% of healthy persons, and in immune-compromised patients, Candida species can trigger a variety of disease manifestations. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic infection of soft buccal mucosa that can appear as erythematous patches or white, scrapable lesions. OPC is often one of the first clinical signs of HIV infection and is observed with a higher prevalence in patients with CD4+ counts below 200/mm or a high viral load. The present study aimed to evaluate the forms of OPC and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients.

2. The study was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study carried out for a 2-year period, in which quantitative data collection methods were used. Patient records were initially studied, and then the patients were asked to visit the clinic for a further evaluation. A complete medical history was taken, and a physical examination of the oral cavity, head, and neck area was performed on each patient. The variables studied included medical history, physical examination, socio-demographic characteristics, socio-behavioral factors, experience with oral lesions, and laboratory tests.

3. Diagnosis of oral lesions was implemented using European Community Clearinghouse guidelines for presumptive diagnosis of OPC. Blood samples were obtained on the same day as the oral examinations, and their results were recorded onto each participant's questionnaire. A single oral swab was collected from each study participant, and Candida was identified by conventional tests and species identification was performed using the germ tube test, growth on chrom agar Candida medium, and sugar assimilation tests. All patients who had oral lesions and from whom Candida species were isolated were considered to have OPC.

4. Of the 50 consenting participants, 5 (10%) were females and 45 (90%) males, with a median age of 39 years. Most participants had a history of sexual contamination, and the mean CD4+ count was 167.12. The median duration of ART was 2 years, and overall, Candida species was isolated from the oral cavity in 38/50 (76%) of the patients. HIV-associated oral lesions were observed in all patients, including periodontal disease, herpetic lesions, hairy leukoplakia, gingivitis, oral ulceration, Kaposi's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

1. The study analyzed data from two multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trials to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing. The trials included 190 ulcers from 190 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs, and a median age of over 60 years. The patients received intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) or a placebo. The treatment was administered up to complete granulation or a maximum of 8 weeks.

2. The study also included an active postmarketing surveillance of rhEGF treatment in 1,440 DFUs from 60 healthcare units. The results of this series confirmed that granulation tissue development at the end of treatment was an early predictor of final healing. The granulation variables showed good capacity to discriminate healers from nonhealers with ROC curve areas > 70% at the 2nd week and end of treatment. The proportion mediated for granulation variables was very high, suggesting that granulation constitutes an essential part of the healing process.

3. The study proposed several surrogate variables, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment. The variables were generated using the area in mm and time in days. The candidate surrogates were then codified, and their association with the final outcome (complete ulcer closure) was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. The correct classification index was also calculated.

4. The results showed that the granulation tissue covering > 75% of the ulcer area at the end of treatment was the most efficient predictor, with 79.5% correct classification and a high negative predictive value (93.5%). An earlier evaluation of this surrogate marker (granulation tissue covering > 50% of the ulcer area at 2 weeks) was also adequate, with 73.7% correct classification and suitable diagnostic indicators. The best cutoff points for variables based on the area change at the end of treatment were also selected.

5. The proportion mediated for 2 weeks > 50% granulation and end of treatment > 75% granulation were 1.008 and 1.043, respectively, suggesting that almost 100% of the effect of the treatment on complete healing may have been mediated by the formation of granulation",0

1. The breathing process is essential for human survival, and mouth breathing in childhood can lead to pathological adaptations in the stomatognathic system. Mouth breathing can cause maxillary hypoplasia, posterior mandibular demotion, and dental occlusion alterations. These adaptations can lead to functional changes in speech, chewing, and deglutition.

2. The main causes of mouth breathing in childhood include hypertrophy of the pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil, nasal mucosa and turbinate edema, nasal septal deviation, and extended suction habits. Morphological adaptations in mouth-breathing children occur to facilitate air arrival to the alveoli. These adaptations can lead to alterations in normal facial proportions and hard palate elevation.

3. The complexity of mouth breathing consequences justifies the participation of several professionals, including otorhinolaryngologists, odontologists, phonoaudiologists, physiotherapists, and pediatricians. Multidisciplinary staff integration is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. A uniform categorization of mouth breathers is desirable, consisting of the same terminology and complementary exams.

4. Accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is essential for effective treatment. In phonoaudiology, the type of care used for mouth-breathing patients is determined by the etiology of the altered respiratory mode. The accurate use of diagnostic options contributes to early diagnosis and minimizes relapse during mouth breathing rehabilitation.

5. Most causes of mouth breathing are diagnosed through a disarmed otorhinolaryngologic exam, except for the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils, which demands complementary exams. Nasopharyngoscopy is a procedure used to visualize the pharyngeal tonsil and its relation to other nasopharyngeal structures. It is considered by many authors as the most reliable exam in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal obstruction.

6. Cephalometry is an exam similar to cavum radiography, but it is carried out through the use of a cephalostat, which enables the most appropriate patient positioning. It provides data related to craniofacial growth and the myofunctional status of these structures.

1. The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in patients previously treated for breast carcinoma is estimated to be less than 6%. To distinguish between a true local recurrence (TR) and a new primary tumor (NPT), the location, staging, and histological subtype of the new tumor must be studied.

2. A 35-year-old premenopausal woman was diagnosed with moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the right breast and received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy. She remained in complete clinical remission for 4 years and 8 months after the last surgery.

3. Breast cancer is a major public health problem, and IDC is the most frequent form of invasive breast cancer, accounting for 70-80% of all cases. Its treatment is based on a multidisciplinary approach consisting of primary tumor surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy.

4. Inflammatory breast carcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of locally advanced breast carcinomas, representing 0.55% of primary invasive breast tumors. It is important to make a differential diagnosis with locally advanced noninflammatory breast carcinomas and other non-neoplastic diseases.

5. After breast-conserving treatment, IBTR may represent two distinct types of lesions: TR or NPT, which have different natural histories, prognosis, and therapeutic management. TR and NPT can be classified based on pathologic features, such as distinct histology type or change from a more invasive to a less invasive carcinoma.

6. The risk of developing a second breast cancer among women diagnosed with a first breast cancer of any ER status is similar to the risk of developing a first breast cancer in the general population. However, the risk of a second ER-negative breast cancer is high after a first ER-negative tumor, particularly in women with a strong family history.

7. The risk of IBTR is the same whether the patient had previously undergone a mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy (BCT), and with BCT, the risk for developing a second primary breast cancer in the preserved breast is similar to the contralateral one.

1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in developed countries. The neovascular form of AMD, involving choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with fluid exudation or bleeding, accounts for the majority of cases of AMD-related severe central vision loss. Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in the development and progression of AMD.

2. The management of neovascular AMD has been transformed over the past decade with the development and advent of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment, which is significantly more effective in preventing progressive vision loss from neovascular AMD than previous alternative treatment modalities. Anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to significantly improve visual acuity (VA) in many patients with neovascular AMD or other retinal diseases. Current management of neovascular AMD involves the use of continuing anti-VEGF treatment to control signs of exudation by blocking the growth of abnormal blood vessels to prevent vision loss and potentially improve VA.

3. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents ranibizumab (Lucentis) and aflibercept (Eylea) are Health Canada-approved options for the treatment of neovascular AMD. Large multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated that monthly ranibizumab prevents vision loss in most patients with neovascular AMD, with significant visual gain achieved in some. The phase 3 randomized VIEW clinical studies demonstrated that intravitreal aflibercept injection every 8 weeks, following 3 initial monthly injections, was noninferior to monthly ranibizumab.

4. Contrast sensitivity (CS) measures an individual's ability to detect low contrast images and to perceive differences between light and dark, whereas the Snellen VA chart test measures the level at which an individual can identify fine detail at high contrast using black-on-white letters. Using low contrast images, the CS method can detect subtle vision changes that may be concealed by acuity. CS could be considered as an adjunct to standard acuity testing, to better assess visual capability.

1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, causing severe cognitive and physical impairments. It is a common disease among young adults, with most patients diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40.

2. The exact cause of MS is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors, including viruses, are thought to be involved in its pathogenesis. Researchers have identified several immune and non-immune genes that may be associated with MS.

3. Interleukin-25 (IL-25) is a cytokine that plays a key role in stimulating and developing T helper 2 (Th2) responses, which can regulate immune responses during inflammatory diseases like MS. A polymorphism within the IL-25 gene, c424c/a, has been identified as a potential candidate for investigation in MS.

4. The study aimed to evaluate the association between the c424c/a polymorphism and MS in an Iranian population, and found that neither the aa, ac, and cc genotypes nor the a and c alleles were associated with MS. The results suggest that the c424c/a polymorphism is not a risk factor for MS development.

5. The study's findings are consistent with a previous study that found no association between the c424c/a polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), another inflammatory disease. However, other polymorphisms within the IL-25 gene may still be associated with MS, and further research is needed to fully understand the role of IL-25 in MS pathogenesis.",0

1. The study aimed to explore the prevalence of aortic aneurysms (AAs) in elderly Korean males with hypertension who had multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and AA. The study used non-contrast computed tomography (CT) to measure the diameter of the entire aorta, from the thoracic aorta to the abdominal aorta. The prevalence of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) was found to be 36.5%, while the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was 6.0%.

2. The study found that TAA was associated with older age, larger body surface area, and higher diastolic blood pressure, while AAA was associated with dyslipidemia and smoking history. The study also found that TAA was more prevalent in patients with AAA compared to those without AAA. The prevalence of TAA was higher than AAA in the study population, which is contrary to previous reports.

3. The study highlights the need for distinct screening strategies for TAA and AAA according to risk factors and ethnicity. The results of the study cannot be applied to females, other ethnicities, or groups with a low-risk of cardiovascular disease. Future research should establish methods for aortic screening for TAA and strategies for conservative as well as surgical management in elderly hypertensive patients.",1

1. Endometrial cancer has become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract in developed countries, and early screening methods have made major progress. The successful experience of cervical carcinoma screening has led to a pressing need for an effective approach to screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor. Endometrial complex hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia are considered precursors of type I endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

2. Traditionally, endometrial samples for histologic analysis can be obtained from D&C or under hysteroscope, but the adequacy of specimens obtained using the SAP-1 device compared to these methods is unknown. The SAP-1 device is a direct endometrial sampler designed for minimal pain during sampling, and it meets the requirements for endometrial samplers. The device has to be noninvasive or minimally invasive, cost-effective, and user-friendly to be accepted by primary care physicians and patients for repeated tests.

3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether liquid-based SurePath preparation for endometrial cytology test (ECT) can maintain the three-dimensional structure of the endometrium. Histology is the gold standard for evaluating the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) of ECT. The study was performed from November 2011 to May 2014 at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Peking University First Hospital.

4. The study comprised 1514 patients with endometrial carcinoma risk factors who underwent SAP-1 sampling on an outpatient basis, and 375 of these women also underwent D&C or hysteroscopy. Most of the patients were over 40 years of age in both the cytology and histopathology groups. The percentage of postmenopausal women was 69% and 63.5%, respectively, in the two groups.

5. The results of the study demonstrate that the SAP-1 sampler combined with the liquid-based SurePath preparation method is a reliable diagnostic method. The overall accuracy for detecting endometrial cancer, complex hyperplasia with atypia, and EIN was 92.4%, with a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 95.8%, a PPV of 75%, and an NPV of 95.3%.

1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with nearly 1.7 million new cases in 2012, and the highest incidence rates are in Europe and North America. The highest incidence rates by country are in Belgium, Denmark, and France.

2. Screening mammography has been associated with a 50% reduction in mortality rate, and digital mammography (DM) is now the most commonly performed procedure for breast cancer detection. DM is less likely to be lost or damaged and has slightly higher sensitivity than screen-film mammography (SFM).

3. Conventional mammography has limitations, including the problem of overlapping tissue, which can obscure tumors, and dense breast tissue, which can hide abnormalities. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a 3D procedure that can help solve these problems by creating image slices of a tissue volume.

4. DBT uses x-rays like conventional mammography but creates thin image slices, decreasing the problem of overlapping tissue, and has been shown to improve mammogram accuracy and increase cancer detection. DBT can be used for both screening and diagnostic mammography.

5. Studies have shown that adding DBT to standard mammography increases mammogram accuracy, decreases recall rates, and increases cancer detection, particularly in women with dense breast tissue. DBT has also been shown to decrease false-positive recalls and improve patient comfort.

6. The radiation dose for DBT is approximately the same as that of SFM or DM, but synthetically reconstructed 2D images can be made from DBT data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing radiation dose. DBT also shows promise in demonstrating the same or higher accuracy as digital spot-compression mammography.

7. Further developments in optimizing imaging parameters and continued improvements in decreasing radiation exposure are ongoing in DM, and DBT is proving to address some of the limitations of conventional mammography, with improved cancer detection, fewer false positives, and lower recall rates. The true performance of DBT remains to be determined when the results of more large-population trials have concluded.",1

1. Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications have been criticized for lacking evidence supporting their efficacy, but this study demonstrates that diphenhydramine inhibits cough reflex sensitivity. Diphenhydramine is a commonly used first-generation antihistamine in the US, classified as an antitussive (cough suppressant) by the FDA.

2. Cough is the most common complaint for which patients in the US seek medical attention, with billions of dollars spent annually on non-prescription OTC cough preparations, but scant evidence exists supporting their efficacy. Three non-narcotic oral agents are listed as antitussives in the FDA final monograph for OTC antitussive drug products: chlophedianol, dextromethorphan, and diphenhydramine.

3. Diphenhydramine has been shown to inhibit citric acid-induced cough in healthy volunteers and diminish pathological chronic cough relative to placebo, and the American College of Chest Physicians recommends its combination with a decongestant as the treatment of choice for chronic cough. However, this recommendation is based largely on clinical experience and expert opinion, lacking adequately powered, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials.

4. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of a diphenhydramine-containing, multicomponent syrup compared with a dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo on cough reflex sensitivity in otherwise healthy subjects with acute URI. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.

5. Twenty-two subjects were recruited and completed the study, with significant differences in log C5 responses observed among the groups, revealing a significant increase in mean log C5 for the diphenhydramine-containing medication versus placebo, but not for dextromethorphan versus placebo. Cough reflex sensitivity was significantly inhibited (log C5 increased) after diphenhydramine.

6. The study's findings suggest that diphenhydramine is an effective antitussive, and further clinical trials are needed to adequately evaluate OTC cough and cold products, allowing physicians and consumers to make informed treatment decisions based on proper scientific data. The study contributes initial evidence demonstrating the ability of diphenhydramine to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in acute pathological cough.",1

2. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by a reduction in vasodilator substances and an increase in vasoconstrictor factors, is a key contributor to cardiovascular disease and is exacerbated by aging.
3. Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses, plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction and is increased with aging.
4. Exercise training has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce oxidative stress, and alleviate inflammatory processes, making it a valuable tool in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.

1. The axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and prognosis worsens with an increasing number of metastatic lymph nodes. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International Union Against Cancer (UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification system classifies nodal disease into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes.

2. The number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of removed lymph nodes, and studies have shown that the number of metastatic lymph nodes increases with the number of removed lymph nodes. The ratio of the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the number of removed lymph nodes, known as the lymph node ratio (LNR), provides more useful prognostic information than the number of metastatic lymph nodes.

3. The study evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR in breast carcinoma patients with 1-3 axillary metastatic lymph nodes. A total of 924 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study, and their follow-up data were obtained from file records and telephone calls.

4. The study found that the number of removed lymph nodes was significantly related to disease-free survival (DFS) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), but not to distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). The LNR was found to be a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes.

5. The most significant LNR threshold values separating patients into low- and high-risk groups were 0.20 for DFS, 0.30 for LRFS, and 0.15 for DMFS. When the grouping based on the number of removed lymph nodes was added to the analysis, its prognostic significance was lost, while the prognostic significance of LNR persisted.

6. The study results suggest that LNR can be used to separate patients with n1 disease into low- and high-risk groups for DFS, LRFS, and DMFS, regardless of the total number of lymph nodes removed. LNR is a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes and can provide more detailed and useful prognostic information than TNM nodal disease classification.

7. The study concludes that LNR is a useful tool in separating breast carcinoma patients with 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes into low- and high-risk prognostic groups, and may be useful",0

1. Non-native biological invaders have been noted for centuries, with examples including the phylloxera that destroyed grapevines in Europe in the 1860s and the chestnut blight that devastated North America in the early 20th century. Charles Elton's 1958 book on the topic did not inspire a broad research thrust or public response.

2. In the 1980s, an international project engaged over 100 scientists and triggered an explosion of research on invasions, recognizing them as one of the great ongoing global environmental changes. This research included studies on how non-native invaders eat, compete with, or infect native species.

3. Two new lines of research have become prominent, indicating that introduced species have more varied and widespread impacts than previously thought. One line focuses on ecosystem-level impacts, such as affecting nutrient cycles and other ecosystem processes.

4. The other line of research focuses on genetics and evolution, revealing cases of ""stealth"" impacts, hybridization, and introgression with native species. Molecular genetic techniques have shown that substantial introgression can occur even between native species that never hybridize.

5. Introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations, producing novel genetic combinations, and environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to detect invaders. The phenomenon of ""invasional meltdown"" has also been detected, where two or more introduced species facilitate each other's establishment.

6. Critics of invasion biology argue that the problems are overblown, introduced species increase native biodiversity, and the antipathy towards introduced species is xenophobic. However, many complete species extinctions have been caused by introduced species, especially on islands.

7. The key criticisms from an ecological standpoint are which introduced species really cause harm and whether we can do anything about it. However, modern invasion biology is still new, and the great majority of introduced species have not been studied in their introduced ranges.

8. Research has found that about 30% of introduced terrestrial vertebrates and freshwater plants and animals are known to have harmful impacts, and the lag effect suggests that it would be foolhardy to wait for an impact to be recognized before acting. Attempts to identify which species would be likely to become invasive have had some success.

9. Biosecurity can be very effective, and the technology exists for early detection and rapid response, but it requires political will. Eradication projects have been undertaken, and there have been striking successes, especially when populations have not yet spread widely beyond the initial introduction site.

2. The most common schwannoma is the vestibular schwannoma, which arises from the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve and accounts for 51% of all nerve sheath tumors found anywhere in the body.
3. Schwannomas in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, including vidian canal schwannomas, are much rarer, with only 4 cases of biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannomas reported in the literature.
4. The vidian nerve arises from the joining of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve and innervates the lacrimal gland and secretory pathways of the nasopalatine glands.
5. Damage to the vidian nerve can result in decreased or absent lacrimation, corneal desiccation, dryness of the nasal mucosa, and cluster headaches.

1. Posterior transpedicular pedicle screw fixation is a widely used method for managing unstable spines, particularly for burst fractures, which account for 10-20% of such injuries.
2. The aims of surgery for these fractures include decompression of neural components, fracture reduction, and providing stable fixation until arthrodesis is achieved.
3. Short-segment spinal instrumentation has been beneficial in managing thoracolumbar spinal fractures, but it is also associated with loss of reduction and instrumentation failure in some cases.
4. Adding pedicle screws at the fractured vertebra, known as intermediate screws, can improve biomechanical stability of the construct, and this study aimed to compare the biomechanical performance of monoaxial versus polyaxial pedicle screws with or without an intermediate screw.
5. The study used a calf experimental model of an unstable burst fracture and found that the addition of intermediate screws decreased the range of motion of the L2-L4 segments in both monoaxial and polyaxial pedicle screw groups.
6. The study also found that the short-segment mps fixation group was significantly more stable in flexion and extension than the short-segment pps fixation group.

1. The discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering required for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, allowing for the use of conductive plastic substrates. The authors have previously demonstrated the use of ESA with ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes.

2. The addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the ZnO surface brought about a significant impact on the crystal growth and alteration of the crystallographic orientation of the film. The coprecipitation of dye molecules did not deteriorate the crystallinity of ZnO, and the resulting hybrid films exhibited dye-sensitized photocathodic properties. The intimate chemistry between ZnO and dyes having soft basic anchors appears to be the key for hole injection from the dye excited state.

3. The authors have been seeking to perform cathodic electrodeposition of CuSCN, a p-type, wide-bandgap semiconductor, into highly crystallized thin films at low temperature. CuSCN has been frequently used as a hole conductor in nanostructured solar cells and as a sensitized photocathode in combination with hole-injecting dyes. The ESA of CuSCN-based hybrid thin films could serve as a counterpart to the well-established ZnO-based hybrid systems.

4. The authors employed dye molecules having soft Lewis basic NCS groups, which are suited for binding to hard Lewis acidic Ti(IV) sites of TiO2 or Zn(II) sites of ZnO. They added dyes having NCS groups, such as N3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FTC), to the bath for electrodeposition of CuSCN. The addition of N3 and FTC brought about the evolution of characteristic nanostructures of CuSCN, clearly indicating their action as structure-directing agents (SDAs).

1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, and it is believed to be a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx. This remnant normally disappears during the second month of intrauterine fetal development, but if it becomes obstructed, it can form a Tornwaldt's cyst. The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is more common and should be part of the differential diagnosis of nasopharyngeal abscesses and cysts.

2. The symptoms of nasopharyngeal bursitis can be either a space-occupying lesion or rhinitis, and may include nasal obstruction, eustachian tube obstruction with secretory otitis media, dysphagia, cranial nerve paralysis, choanal discharge, halitosis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and gastritis. Pulsating headache and occipital pain felt at the external occipital tuberculum are also common symptoms. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, but it can appear at any age.

3. The peak incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis occurs between 15 and 30 years, with a Caucasian predominance and no gender predilection. Most published literature comprises selected case reports and describes the cystic type, but no single report has estimated the true incidence of crust-type nasopharyngeal bursitis or characterized its symptoms. This study aimed to identify the incidence of nasopharyngeal bursa disease, its different types, and its clinical presentation over two years in a single rhinology practice.

All patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal bursitis confirmed by endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx and computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging were asked about symptoms of Tornwaldt's syndrome.

1. The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing over the past few decades, with 76,250 new cases diagnosed in the USA in 2012, resulting in 9,180 deaths. Early diagnosis is crucial for the prognosis of the disease, and dermoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that can aid in the visualization of morphological features not discernible by the naked eye.

2. Dermoscopy enables better diagnosis compared to unaided eye, with an improvement in diagnostic sensitivity of 10-30%. However, it requires great deal of experience to differentiate skin lesions, and even experts have only achieved 90% sensitivity and 59% specificity in skin lesion diagnosis.

3. Several scoring systems and algorithms have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of less experienced clinicians, but they have limitations and have not yet been fully solved. The purpose of these systems is to find the location of a lesion and determine the probability of a disease.

4. The development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for skin lesions involves several steps, including image preprocessing, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The inputs to the CAD system are digital images obtained by epiluminescence microscopy (ELM) or other acquisition systems.

5. Image preprocessing is necessary to reduce the ill effects and artifacts present in dermoscopic images, such as uneven illumination, dermoscopic gel, and hair. Filtering techniques, color space transformation, and artifact removal methods can be used to facilitate image segmentation and feature extraction.

6. Segmentation refers to the partitioning of an image into disjoint regions that are homogeneous with respect to a chosen property such as luminance, color, and texture. Several segmentation algorithms are available, including statistical and model-based methods, and filtering-based methods.

1. The study examined the impact of CYP2C19*2 and PON1 Q192R polymorphisms on clopidogrel platelet inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease. The study found that CYP2C19*2 polymorphism was associated with reduced platelet inhibition, but PON1 Q192R polymorphism was not.

2. Clopidogrel is converted into its active metabolite through a two-step process involving CYP450 enzymes and PON1. The active metabolite inhibits platelet aggregation, which is essential for preventing stent thrombosis.

3. Previous studies have shown that CYP2C19*2 polymorphism is associated with reduced platelet inhibition and increased risk of stent thrombosis. However, the role of PON1 Q192R polymorphism in clopidogrel response is less clear.

4. The study enrolled 151 patients with coronary artery disease who were on dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin. The patients were genotyped for CYP2C19*2 and PON1 Q192R polymorphisms.

5. The study found that CYP2C19*2 carriers had higher platelet aggregation and lower platelet inhibition compared to non-carriers. In contrast, PON1 Q192R polymorphism was not associated with platelet aggregation or inhibition.

6. The study also found that PON1 Q192R polymorphism was not associated with platelet inhibition in patients who received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose prior to percutaneous coronary intervention. This suggests that PON1 Q192R polymorphism may not play a significant role in clopidogrel response.

7. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown CYP2C19*2 polymorphism to be a strong determinant of clopidogrel response. However, the study's findings contradict previous studies that have suggested a role for PON1 Q192R polymorphism in clopidogrel response.

8. The study's limitations include a relatively small sample size and a lack of pharmacokinetic analysis to detect differences in active metabolite concentrations. Despite these limitations, the study's findings suggest that CYP2C19*2 polymorphism is a more important determinant of clopidogrel response than PON1 Q192R polymorphism.",1

1. The treatment of cholelithiasis is a significant healthcare burden, with approximately 20 million people in the US having gallstones and 1 million new patients diagnosed every year, resulting in an estimated annual cost of over $5 billion. The National Institute of Health convened a consensus development conference in 1992 to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The conference concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no apparent increase in morbidity or mortality. The reduction in pain and disability resulted in cost savings for patients and society.

2. The disability and loss of income following standard open cholecystectomy increase costs, but these items are not typically measured by traditional appraisal methods. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has greatly reduced the convalescent period and costs. This example of cost analysis should be requested by business and patients, as they are impacted the most. Indeed, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often surpass those of open cholecystectomy, which is surprising given the reduced length of stay and hospital support required.

3. Surgeons at Maricopa Medical Center identified excessive length of stay and charges by comparing cholecystectomy DRG 195 with 16 other hospitals in the region. The remainder were either old patients with complications or young patients with advanced disease and complicated courses. Little could be done to reduce charges except to either lessen the conversion rates or costs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Matched pair comparisons from the same database of charges between open cholecystectomy and converted laparoscopic cholecystectomy were accomplished to get a precise estimate of laparoscopic charges.

4. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients was conducted from a four-year database of 633 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy. Thirty-five patients with converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies and thirty-five patients with open cholecystectomies were selected from the data by matching for age, sex, and similar diagnosis. A paired sample t-test was used for statistical analysis with significance at the p=0.05 level. Decision tree and sensitivity analyses were then used to choose the most cost-effective operation and determine what the limitation of charges would be needed to make laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost-effective.

1. The study analyzed the characteristics and determinants of partial remission (PR) in 242 children with type 1 diabetes, defined as insulin-dose-adjusted A1c (IDAA1c) ≤ 9. PR occurred in 56.2% of patients, with a mean duration of 9.2 months, and was more frequent in patients without diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis. The absence of DKA was significantly higher in PR patients, especially in boys. PR duration was not associated with age, sex, or body mass index (BMI).

2. The study found that lower A1c levels at diagnosis were associated with higher chances of PR, and patients entering PR had lower baseline A1c levels than those without PR. A1c levels at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after diagnosis were strongly associated with PR duration. Higher C-peptide levels at diagnosis were also observed in patients entering PR, especially in older patients. C-peptide levels at diagnosis did not correlate with PR duration.

3. The study did not find any long-term effects of PR on diabetes complications or incidence of severe hypoglycemia, possibly due to low numbers of events. However, a short-term effect of PR on metabolic control was suggested in patients with PR durations between 510 and 570 days. PR duration or A1c levels did not correlate with the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia.

1. Oral health is crucial for the quality of life of individuals of all age groups, and oral lesions can lead to discomfort, pain, and interference with daily activities. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers a population over 60 years old to be elderly, and India's 2011 census showed that 8.6% of the population was 60 years or more. This highlights the importance of geriatric healthcare, particularly in the field of gerodontology.

2. There have been few studies on the prevalence of oral lesions in the elderly population, and most of them were based on clinical evaluations. The prevalence of oral lesions varies according to nation, geographic region, and community, and is influenced by socioeconomic differences, medical and dental history, treatment expenditure, and handicaps. No previous studies have been conducted in the Indian subcontinent to estimate the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in the elderly population.

3. The present study aimed to find the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in 5,100 geriatric patients in India, with a focus on the clinical, histopathological, and microbiological diagnosis of the lesions. The study consisted of 5,100 patients, with 3,100 men and 2,000 women, aged 60 to 98 years, attending the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital. A written informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to the study.

4. The study found that 3,264 patients (64%) presented with various oral lesions, with males being more affected (66%) than females (34%). The majority of the oral lesions were observed in patients between 65 to 70 years of age, and the hard palate had the most lesions (23.1%), followed by the tongue (16.4%) and gingiva (14.7%). The soft palate was the least affected site (3.6%).

5. The lesions identified during the study were classified into 27 different clinical entities, with nicotinic stomatitis (43%) due to tobacco use and denture stomatitis (34%) due to long use of prostheses being the most commonly diagnosed lesions. OSMF (30%) was also a commonly seen premalignant lesion due to the high percentage of people with the habit of betel nut chewing. Leukoplakia was seen in 22% of the patients, and lichen planus was detected in 18% of patients.

1. Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that can occur in the temporal bone and temporomandibular joint (TMJ), causing symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, and hearing impairments. The tumor can be difficult to diagnose due to its unusual histological features, and incomplete resection can lead to recurrence. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, and surgical removal is the recommended treatment to avoid malignant changes.

2. A 41-year-old male patient was misdiagnosed with otitis media and TMJ disorder, but was later found to have a chondroblastoma in the temporal bone. The tumor had progressed and destroyed the middle cranial fossa, and the patient underwent a modified surgical procedure to remove the tumor and reconstruct the facial tissue. The patient showed no signs of recurrence or postoperative dysfunction four and a half years after surgery.",1

1. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between objectively measured sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity with visceral adiposity and liver fat in adults with overweight or obesity. The participants were recruited from a community-based sample and underwent various assessments, including magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, accelerometry, and blood tests. The study found that traditional risk factors such as waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin were associated with visceral adiposity and liver fat. However, no relationship was observed between objectively measured physical inactivity and raised liver fat.

2. The study found a weak positive association between visceral adiposity and time spent in moderate activity, and also total energy expenditure. The inclusion of objectively measured levels of moderate activity and sedentary behavior did not improve the potency of traditional risk factors for predicting liver fat concentration or visceral adiposity. The study suggests that current habitual activity levels are not related to visceral adiposity or liver fat, but it does not account for lifetime levels of habitual activity. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between habitual physical activity and metabolically detrimental fat depots.

3. The study's findings appear counterintuitive to epidemiological data, which suggests that physical inactivity is associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and visceral adiposity. However, the study accurately quantified both liver fat and visceral adiposity, as well as 24-hour habitual physical activity behavior, suggesting that the relationship may not be as straightforward. The emphasis for behavior change in this population should arguably be on adopting and adhering to structured exercise programs. There is strong and consistent evidence that regular structured physical activity reduces visceral adiposity and liver fat.

4. The study's findings suggest that the role of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior in the development of abdominal obesity and liver fat is unclear and perhaps minimal. While low amounts of physical activity and high amounts of sedentary behavior predict mortality, the association between sedentary behavior and markers of cardiometabolic risk disappears when adjusted for total physical activity levels. Only individuals with low activity and high levels of sedentary behavior such as sitting may be at increased health risk.

5. The study's limitations include its cross-sectional design, which does not account for lifetime levels of habitual activity, and the limited range of liver fat levels in the non-NAFLD cohort. Further research is needed to examine the interaction between sedentary behavior, physical activity levels, and metabolically detrimental fat depots, employing gold-standard methods, across a more diverse population",0

1. The study is a retrospective, observational, consecutive case series conducted in a tertiary eye care hospital in North India, which included 53 eyes of 45 patients with fireworks-related injuries during the 5-day Diwali festival from 2011 to 2015. The patients' age range was 3-53 years, with a mean age of 20.55 years, and the majority (39) were males.

2. The study found that 18 eyes underwent surgical management, 34 eyes were managed conservatively, and one eye was advised primary enucleation. The visual outcome was poor, with 22 eyes having a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/6, 11 eyes having a BCVA between 6/60 and 6/9, and 7 eyes having a BCVA of less than 6/60 to perception of light.

3. The study highlights the severity of ocular damage caused by fireworks, with 5 eyes having open-globe injuries and 48 eyes having closed-globe injuries. The most common types of firecrackers causing injury were bombs, and high-velocity fireworks such as rockets and bombs were more frequently associated with facial lacerations, intraocular foreign body, and poorer visual outcome.

4. The study emphasizes the need for public awareness and strong legislation to regulate the manufacture, sale, and use of consumer fireworks to reduce the preventable cause of ocular morbidity. Firework-related eye injuries are an important cause of preventable blindness, especially in the younger economically productive population, and can lead to blindness, facial burns, and permanent disfigurement.",1

1. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, and it is considered an early, mild form of thyroid failure. The prevalence of SCH varies widely depending on the population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement. The normal reference range for TSH levels needs to be standardized, and quality control procedures should be established by each laboratory.

2. SCH has various causes, with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis being the most common, and it is more common in girls and women, but the incidence increases with age in both sexes. Patients who have been treated for overt thyroid failure often exhibit SCH due to inadequate thyroid hormone supplementation or poor adherence to treatment. The prevalence of SCH ranges from 4% to 20% in the adult population, with women, elderly people, and iodine-sufficient populations being affected more often.

3. SCH is associated with adverse clinical effects, including increased body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid levels, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Variations in thyroid function within the population reference range have a substantial impact on weight and BMI, and higher levels of TSH are associated with an increased BMI and weight gain. Additionally, SCH is associated with worsening blood pressure and altered lipid levels.

4. SCH can lead to vascular problems, including increased vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction, and it is also associated with metabolic syndrome (METS), which is a cluster of metabolic disorders that increase the risk of CVD and mortality. SCH is associated with all components of METS, and the odds of having METS are positively associated with TSH levels within the reference range. High normal TSH levels are significantly associated with the increased prevalence of METS.

5. SCH can lead to impaired cardiac function, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and it is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, particularly in older people with a high CVD risk. T4 replacement therapy may improve cardiac function, endothelial function, and carotid intima-media thickness in individuals with SCH. However, the benefits of T4 treatment on serum lipid levels in SCH patients are limited and inconsistent.

6. The indications for screening and treatment of SCH remain a clinical controversy, and the decision to treat or not treat an SCH patient will be based on clinical judgment, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion until the results",0

1. Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and its diagnosis is often based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) results. However, EIA has a low detection sensitivity for C. difficile toxins, which can lead to misdiagnosis. The present study aimed to investigate patients with EIA-positive stool specimens and toxin-negative results.

2. The study included 127 patients whose stool specimens were submitted for C. difficile toxin testing between March 2013 and June 2014. Patients were divided into three groups based on EIA CD toxin results in stool specimens and isolates obtained from bacterial culture. The groups were toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool/toxin-positive isolate, and dual toxin-negative stool and isolate.

3. No significant differences were observed in clinical characteristics, such as comorbidities, malignant tumors, and recent history of transplant, among the three groups. The number and administration frequencies of antimicrobial drugs received by patients within 30 days prior to diarrhea onset were also similar among the groups. However, a significant difference was observed in mean diarrhea duration between the toxin-positive stool group and the toxin-negative stool specimens.

4. Diarrhea duration was significantly shorter in patients with toxin-negative stool specimens compared to those with toxin-positive stool specimens, despite the lack of CDAD drug treatment in all but one of the toxin-negative stool specimen patients. Furthermore, diarrhea duration also tended to be shorter in patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates compared to those with toxin-positive stool specimens. This suggests that patients who tested positive for C. difficile on culture but negative for toxins in their stool had milder symptoms.

5. The study found that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens but toxin-positive isolates did not receive CDAD treatment, and diarrhea duration in this group did not differ significantly from that in the dual-negative group. This may indicate that the group with toxin-negative isolates may have been infected with non-toxigenic C. difficile, while the toxin concentration in the stool and intestines of the group with toxin-positive isolates but toxin-negative stool specimens was likely too low to be detected by EIA.

6. The study supported previous reports that EIA toxin-negative patients had significantly milder diarrhea, shorter diarrhea duration, and a lower mortality rate than toxin-positive patients. However, other studies have reported no difference in clinical symptoms between toxin-negative and toxin-positive patients, and a consensus has yet to be reached.

1. The DREAM trial was a large, international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that aimed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
2. The study found that rosiglitazone, but not ramipril, significantly improved measures of β-cell function over time, including insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration, in people with IFG and/or IGT.
3. The improvement in β-cell function with rosiglitazone was consistent across glucose tolerance subgroups, although the effect was more modest in those with isolated IFG.
4. The study suggests that the diabetes preventive effect of rosiglitazone may be partly due to its ability to improve β-cell function, as the effect of rosiglitazone on diabetes prevention persisted after adjusting for baseline β-cell function.
5. The results of the study support the hypothesis that measures of change in β-cell function in response to therapy may be indexes of a therapy's ability to reduce the incidence of diabetes.",1

1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in terms of the toxins they degrade, natural products they produce, and their capacity to grow in certain environments. This study aims to understand microbial metabolism by extending the properties of individual strains in pure culture to complex communities. Interacting partners share metabolites, such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose. A general model of metabolic interaction would account for the variety of metabolites exchanged and the genotypic diversity of the strains.

2. The study uses a set of E. coli auxotrophs, which are conditionally lethal mutants that require an external supply of a specific metabolite for growth. Each deletion blocks the biosynthesis of an essential metabolite, and the selected mutations cover a significant portion of metabolic diversity. The strains were co-cultured in minimal media in all pairwise combinations, and growth was measured by optical density. Theoretical and empirical precedents have established that metabolic cooperation is enhanced at intermediate cell densities.

3. A subset of mixed pairs showed improved growth relative to either corresponding monoculture, indicating metabolic synergy. Growth phenotypes were variable, with alternately one strain, both, or neither benefiting from the interaction. For each strain, at least one partner with which synergistic growth was evident was identified. No strain exhibited a universally cooperative phenotype, either in the role of nutrient donor or recipient.

4. The study explores how the growth of a given strain relates to its level of cooperation, as inferred from the growth of its partner strain. Cooperating strains may show enhanced proliferation through the mechanism of invested benefits. Cooperation on the part of strain A will augment A's growth only if B cooperates in turn. By increasing B's abundance, A then cultivates the source of A's own metabolites and therefore A's own growth.

5. The study defines a new synthetic relationship, the synergistic growth between two otherwise lethal mutants, as Synthetic Mutualism in Trans (Smit). Smit interactions can be applied to infer properties of the E. coli metabolic network. Pairings of strains with metabolic blocks in the same biosynthetic pathway grew less than pairings of strains blocked in distinct pathways. Mutants sharing pathways showed consistency in their set of cooperating partners.

6. The study constructs a cooperation profile vector for each strain, consisting of the measured growth of that strain and that of its partner strain in each of the 46 co-cultures. Correlations of the cooperation profiles indicate the overall similarity of the cooperative behavior between two strains.",0

2. The study of the CYLD gene in patients and their relatives can provide molecular diagnosis and appropriate genetic counseling, and patients require long-term follow-up due to the low risk of malignancy. The syndrome has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is more common in females.

3. A 71-year-old woman was evaluated for the progressive development of asymptomatic lesions on her head, and the histopathological diagnosis was spiradenoma in all lesions except for one cylindroma. The patient's family history revealed the presence of similar lesions in her mother, mother's brother, and two of her three daughters.

The materials were tested for suture retention strength, tear resistance, and ball burst strength, and were found to possess suitable properties for hernia repair applications. The Phasix mesh and P4HB plug were also found to be intact and visible at the repair sites at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks.

The Phasix mesh and P4HB plug repairs also demonstrated similar burst strength and relative stiffness at all time points.

3. The molecular weight of the Phasix mesh and P4HB plug was also evaluated, and was found to decrease significantly over time.

1. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become important nosocomial pathogens associated with high mortality and costs, and glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is mediated by van genes, with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent. Several European countries have reported a rising incidence of VRE in recent years.

2. The current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, and screening relies on selective culturing and/or detection of the resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR. However, substantial indirect savings can be achieved by rapidly available results.

3. The diagnostic accuracy of various assays to detect vanA and vanB with or without a previous enrichment step has been examined in several studies, but sensitivities ranging from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6% have been reported. The specificity of the detection of the vanB gene is considerably lower, attributed to the presence of vanB-positive anaerobic bacteria.

4. In the laboratory, a culture-based method using overnight enrichment and subsequent plating on chromogenic agar was used to screen for VRE, but in autumn 2014, the Xpert vanA/vanB assay was implemented, which provides results within an hour. The Xpert vanA/vanB assay was used to guide rapid implementation of infection control measures.

5. The laboratory serves a population of 800,000 inhabitants in the northern part of the capital region of Denmark, including four university hospitals with a total number of 1577 beds. The infection control units at these four hospitals are part of the clinical microbiology department and employ six infection control nurses.

6. Diagnosis of VRE in a clinical sample results in roommate screening and isolation precautions are implemented until results are available, and if any roommate is found positive, an outbreak is declared and all patients in the ward are screened weekly until no new patient is diagnosed with VRE. For roommate screening and weekly screening of wards, the routine culture-based screening is supplemented by vanA PCR.

7. From 30 December 2014 to 15 August 2015, 1110 VRE screening samples from 804 patients were examined both by the culture-based method and by PCR, and the samples were from 24 different departments from four different hospitals.

3. In diabetic hearts, RU was similarly effective as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and dual therapies involving RU were similarly effective as capt + los therapy, whereas triple combination was generally the most effective strategy.

2. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry, which has been shown to have a close correlation with rhinomanometry and can provide accurate results when compared to MRI and CT scans.
3. The study evaluated the changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian individuals who underwent cosmetic rhinoplasty using AR, comparing differences in length, minimal cross-sectional area, and volume of each nasal cavity before and after surgery.
4. The results showed that bilateral d1, bilateral d2, and left mca2 did not change significantly after surgery, while bilateral d1 and both mca2 decreased significantly, and mca1 increased significantly postoperatively.
5. The study found that septoplasty resulted in a greater increase in mca1 and less constriction in mca2, and that double osteotomy was beneficial for patients, especially in cases without septoplasty.
6. Placing a columellar strut was also found to be beneficial for patients, especially in cases with septoplasty, and resulted in a greater increase in mca1.
7. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that reported a reduction in internal dimensions of the nasal cavity, especially the anterior dimensions, and highlight the importance of paying attention to the second constriction point during surgery.
8. The results suggest that even in cases with mild septal deviation, performing septoplasty may increase patient nose patency, and that double osteotomy and placing a strut may also be beneficial for patients.

1. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths, and its incidence is still increasing. Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) were proved in several observational and experimental studies.

2. N-3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmic effects, and low-grade chronic inflammation is now recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The induction of inflammation may well provide a link between hyperlipidemia and atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease featured by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through the disease progression.

3. There is a vast amount of epidemiologic evidence of a cardioprotective effect of fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and it was confirmed in randomized controlled trials. Several intervention studies have shown that an increased intake of EPA and DHA lowers the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The first GISSI-Prevenzione trial demonstrated that patients had a 15% lower combined risk of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke upon supplementation with 850 mg/day of LC n-3 PUFA.

4. N-3 PUFAs may interact with inflammation-related mechanisms, such as endothelial activation, modification of eicosanoid metabolism, and resolution of the inflammatory process. Low-grade chronic inflammation is present in several diseases and is characterized by abnormal circulating levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. N-3 PUFAs may modulate inflammation, which is suggested by the reduction of plasma inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6) and inflammatory markers as high sensitive C-reactive protein, observed after the intake of EPA and DHA.

5. The cardioprotective effects of LC n-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA intake in human subjects are due to their lipid-lowering, hypotensive, anti-arrhythmic, and anti-thrombotic properties. Moreover, studies performed in the last twenty years showed heterogeneous effects of different n-3 PUFAs on",0

1. The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is built on the work of three pioneering pathologists: Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren. Virchow is considered the father of modern pathology and proposed that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. His ideas set the stage for later research on the relationship between inflammation and cancer.

2. Correa, a pathologist from Colombia, developed a model for gastric cancer development, proposing that the development of intestinal-type gastric cancer results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years. He initially thought that environmental factors, such as diet, were responsible for promoting this progression. Later, he focused on the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer.

3. Warren and Marshall discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, and were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005. They found that H. pylori was common in peptic ulcer patients and caused gastritis and ulcer disease. Although they did not investigate the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer directly, they were aware of the relationship between gastritis and cancer.

4. Later studies provided convincing evidence for the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer, including three large cohorts with nested case-control studies that found that H. pylori infection was significantly more common in those who developed gastric cancer. The World Health Organization declared H. pylori a definite carcinogen in 1994. Subsequent research has confirmed and expanded upon these findings, including the discovery that H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.

5. The eradication of H. pylori from a community could help prevent much gastric cancer, as well as greatly diminish the morbidity of peptic ulcers. However, there is concern about the ecologic consequences of using multiple antibiotics in a large proportion of the population to prevent H. pylori-related disease. Research on vaccination against H. pylori is ongoing, and may provide a non-antibiotic strategy for prevention in the future.",1

1. The study compared the functional and anatomical outcomes of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in Turkish patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The patients were treated with as-needed injections of either bevacizumab or ranibizumab, and their visual acuity and central retinal thickness were measured at various time points. The study found that both groups showed significant improvements in visual acuity and central retinal thickness compared to baseline. The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) were similar between the two groups at all time points.

2. The study found that 43.0% of patients in the bevacizumab group and 40.5% of patients in the ranibizumab group gained 3 or more lines of visual acuity. Additionally, 86.1% of patients in the bevacizumab group and 86.5% of patients in the ranibizumab group had stable or improved vision. The mean number of injections at month 12 was similar between the two groups, with 4.8 injections in the bevacizumab group and 4.7 injections in the ranibizumab group. No serious ocular or systemic complications were observed in either group.

3. The study's results are consistent with previous studies that have found similar efficacy and safety profiles for bevacizumab and ranibizumab in the treatment of nAMD. A short-term efficacy and safety study by Landa et al. found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab resulted in similar improvements in visual and anatomical outcomes one month after an intravitreal injection. A retrospective study by Feng et al. found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab were both effective in stabilizing visual acuity in nAMD patients after 12 months of follow-up. The CATT study, a multicenter noninferiority trial, found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab had similar efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of nAMD.

4. The study's strengths include the fact that patients in both groups had similar baseline characteristics and received no other forms of treatment. The study's results suggest that as-needed bevacizumab and ranibizumab are both effective and safe treatments for nAMD, with similar visual and anatomical outcomes and injection numbers.",0

3. They focus on antigen-specific vaccines, which have shown promise in eliciting immune responses, but require biomarkers to monitor their efficacy.
4. The study uses a panel of 126 prostate tissue- and prostate cancer-associated antigens to detect IgG responses in patients with prostate cancer treated with different therapies.

1. The study explores the use of piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect to mechanically stimulate bone growth at the bone-implant interface.
2. The researchers used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as substrates for MC3T3 cells and applied an alternating sinusoidal current to stimulate the cells.
3. The actuator device was implanted in the left hind limb of a sheep, and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb, with the aim of comparing bone growth around the two devices.
4. The results showed that the total bone area around the actuated devices was significantly higher than around the static controls, with an increase in new bone formation and mineral apposition rate.
5. The expression of osteopontin (OPN) was higher around the actuated devices, which is associated with mechanical stress and bone formation.
6. The study found no significant differences in fibrous capsule thickness between the actuated and static devices, suggesting that the electric insulation remained satisfactory.
7. The results suggest that the generated strains from the actuator devices were enough to elicit a response, but further studies are needed to prove the effects of the electric field on bone growth.
8. The study highlights the need to develop more biocompatible materials and to enlarge the animal study to confirm the results.
9. The use of piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect shows promise as a means of stimulating bone growth at the bone-implant interface, but further research is needed to fully understand its effects.",1

1. Lcn2-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, and they were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for 10 generations. The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility and handled according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines.

2. The mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a regular chow diet (RCD), and their body weight, fat pad weight, and organ weight were measured. Lcn2 mice were significantly heavier than wild-type mice on either an HFD or RCD.

3. The fat cell size distribution of Lcn2 mice on an RCD was measured, and the average peak diameter of the large-cell population was significantly larger for Lcn2 mice compared with wild-type mice. This indicates that Lcn2 adipose tissue contains larger adipose cells.

4. Food intake and energy expenditure were examined in Lcn2 mice, and no significant differences were found between RCD-fed wild-type and Lcn2 mice. However, Lcn2 mice displayed cold sensitivity and could not survive when exposed to 4°C for more than 10 hours.

5. The thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was assessed under thermoneutral and thermal stress conditions, and Lcn2 mice expressed significantly lower levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) coactivator-1 genes in BAT than wild-type mice. However, UCP-1 and PPAR expression in BAT were markedly stimulated at an even higher level in Lcn2 mice after exposure to 4°C for 5 hours.

6. The mitochondrial oxidative capacity of BAT was investigated, and a significant reduction in the expression levels of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function was observed in BAT of Lcn2 mice fed an HFD. The expression of transcription factors PPAR, Nrf1, and Tfam, and Cpt-1 gene in skeletal muscle was also significantly downregulated in Lcn2 mice fed an HFD.

7. Glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were performed to assess the effects of Lcn2 deficiency on systemic insulin sensitivity. Lcn2 mice were more glucose intolerant and insulin resistant than wild-type controls when fed an HFD.

1. The study used 22 male Wistar rats, 10 weeks old, obtained from Sankyo Labo Service Co., Ltd. in Japan. The rats were housed individually in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms with unlimited food and water and a 12-h light/dark cycle. Each rat was given 0.3-mg/kg LPS intravenously on days 1 and 2.

2. On days 3, 4, and 5, the rats were given 20-mg/kg methylprednisolone intramuscularly to promote the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). All injections were administered at 7:00 p.m. Hindlimb unloading was accomplished using a suspension system with some modifications. The tail was varnished with instant adhesive and attached to a strip of traction tape.

3. The animals were suspended in a head-down tilted position, and the suspension angle was readjusted as the body size increased to prevent any weight coming to bear on the hindlimbs. In non-weight-bearing (NWB) rats, the tail was suspended from day 1 to sacrifice. The femur and humerus were harvested from each rat and fixed with 10% formalin-0.1 M phosphate buffer.

4. The tissues were processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess the general architecture and osteonecrosis of the femoral and humeral heads. Histopathological osteonecrosis was defined as the diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis. The data were compared between weight-bearing (WB) and NWB groups using the chi-square test.

5. The study adhered to the guidelines of the Ministry of Sports, Culture, Science and Technology of Japan and followed protocols approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Sapporo Medical University. Femoral head osteonecrosis was observed in 63.6% of WB rats and 54.5% of NWB rats, with no significant intergroup difference observed. The histopathological appearance of the femoral head after hematoxylin and eosin staining showed empty lacunae and decreased hematopoietic cells in both WB and NWB groups.

1. The study found that nurses in Kenya have not been adequately involved in national policy development, with only a few nurse leaders participating in policy committees and limited representation on policy-related structures. This lack of involvement is attributed to a top-down approach to policy-making, which denies nurses opportunities for direct involvement in national policy decisions. As a result, nurses' contributions to policy-making are limited to representing nursing issues at policy tables.

2. The study identified several reasons for nurses' lack of engagement in policy formulation, including a lack of knowledge and skills, inadequate representation on policy committees, and a hierarchical system that excludes nurses from policy-making structures. Non-nursing decision-makers also blamed the nursing profession for its tradition of being a ""closed"" professional group, concerning itself only with professional issues and not broader health care system issues. Additionally, nurses were perceived as being isolated from other professionals in the system.

3. To enhance nurses' participation in policy processes, the study recommends addressing hierarchies, domination, and gender issues inherent in the health care system and establishing mechanisms for nurses' views to reach national-level decision-makers. This can be achieved by enacting legislation that allows nurses with competencies in leadership and policy to hold senior positions in the health care system. Furthermore, national-level decision-makers should solicit the views of nurses at the frontline regarding policies that might affect their work and quality of care.

4. The study also recommends that leadership and advocacy skills should be developed within nursing to enhance nurses' abilities to carry out policy advocacy at all levels. Nurses should unite to build a strong voice to advocate for improvements in national policies that affect their work and quality of care. Additionally, nursing regulators and educators should emphasize that policy involvement is part of nurses' scope of practice.",1

1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders that cause a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which accounts for 95% of all affected patients.

2. The study examined 26 patients with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and found that 42.3% of them showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis. These abnormalities were more frequent in patients with poor hormonal control due to non-compliance with medication.

3. The mechanisms underlying brain MRI abnormalities in CAH patients are not fully understood, but hormonal imbalance during brain development and corticosteroid treatment may play a role. Chronic hyperandrogenism and aldosterone deficiency may also contribute to the development of these abnormalities.

4. The study's findings suggest that brain MRI abnormalities are an interesting finding in CAH patients, and may be related to the severity of the disease and treatment regimens. Further studies are needed to define the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens.",1

1. The human genome draft sequence promises significant biomedical advances, but biologists must navigate the vast genomic data to uncover hidden knowledge. To do this, they need to survey and signpost the genomic landscape to guide experiments that address specific hypotheses about gene function.

2. Different biological communities speak in dialects that are not always mutually comprehensible, particularly with respect to the term ""function"", and a universal vocabulary is needed to facilitate understanding. Websites such as LocusLink, GeneCards, and Ensembl integrate information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes.

3. There are two common ways of annotating genes: one relies on empirical observations, and the other on predicted evolutionary relationships, which define genes that have arisen from a common ancestor as homologs. Homologs often have similar tertiary structures and functions, making it possible to infer clues about a gene's function from its homologs.

4. Annotating genes by homology has its pitfalls, as homology is defined on the basis of evolution rather than function, and homologs may not always share similar molecular mechanisms. Additionally, divergent homologs or non-homologs may have overlapping functions.

5. Domain architectures of proteins imply that evolution has constantly fused and divided genes, using a repertoire of pre-existing components, and domains represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution. Resources such as Pfam, Smart, and InterPro detect domains using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments.

6. Proteome annotation by domain content implies that a gene product's function is a synthesis of the generalized functions of its component parts, providing the best predictions for uncharacterized genes. However, this approach is approximate and does not predict cellular or organismal function, protein-binding partners, or post-translational modifications.

7. The Gene Ontology project has created a hierarchy of defined terms that encompasses many flavors of ""function"" commonly described in biology, and a cross-community approach is underway to deal with the issue of functional annotation. Sophisticated web forums will be essential in accumulating and presenting integrated functional data from diverse sources.",1

1. The biodegradation of materials in the oral cavity can affect the bonding between the bracket and enamel, leading to lower bond strength values in vivo compared to in vitro values. The aim of this study was to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo and compare it to in vitro values. The prototype was designed to overcome the limitations of previous devices.

2. The prototype consisted of a modified plier with a strain gauge connected directly to the claw, a measurement and control circuit, and a PC with specific software. The strain gauge was designed to measure the force of debonding, and the software recorded the values in kgf. The prototype was calibrated with weights ranging from 0.5 kg to 6 kg.

3. The accuracy and precision of the prototype were tested by two examiners who did not standardize the position of their hands on the pliers. Twenty repetitions were performed for each weight, and the mean values were calculated. There were no significant differences between the examiners at any weight.

4. The maxillary central incisor brackets were bonded to the enamel using a specific procedure, and the specimens were stored in 100% relative humidity at 37°C for 24 hours. The specimens were then divided into two groups: group 1 for debonding with the prototype and group 2 for tensile testing in a universal testing machine. The debonding force was recorded in kgf and transformed into newtons and divided by the bracket area to obtain resistance values in mpa.

5. The mean bond strength obtained in group 1 (2.96 mpa) and group 2 (3.08 mpa) were statistically similar. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) score 3 was predominant in both groups, indicating that the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding. This is advantageous since score 3 has the least probability of harming the enamel.

The present prototype was designed to control the influence of the operator's hand by placing the strain gauge near the claw. Strain gauges are defined as localized mechanical deformation sensors that convert mechanical displacement into a range of electrical resistance.

1. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe form of epilepsy that typically begins in childhood, characterized by multiple seizure types, including tonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures. The syndrome is often accompanied by cognitive impairment and behavioral disorders. The prognosis for LGS is generally poor, with regard to both seizures and cognitive outcome.

2. The diagnosis of LGS is based on the presence of specific seizure types, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, and cognitive impairment. The EEG pattern typically shows slow spike-wave discharges, and paroxysms of low-voltage fast activity during sleep. The diagnosis can be challenging due to the variability of seizure types and EEG patterns.

3. The treatment of LGS is difficult due to the multiple seizure types and the need to balance seizure control with minimizing side effects. Valproic acid is often considered the most useful initial medication, followed by lamotrigine, topiramate, and felbamate. However, the optimal treatment approach remains unclear due to the lack of head-to-head trials.

4. Rufinamide is a novel anticonvulsant that has been approved for the treatment of LGS in children and adults. It has a broad-spectrum of anticonvulsant activity and a good safety profile. Rufinamide has been shown to be effective in reducing seizure frequency and severity in patients with LGS.

5. Rufinamide has a unique mechanism of action, involving the inhibition of sodium channel function and the prolongation of sodium channel inactivation. It has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant activity in animal models, including the maximal electroshock model and the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol model. Rufinamide also blocks seizures induced by subcutaneous strychnine, bicuculline, and picrotoxin.

6. Rufinamide has a good safety profile, with minimal side effects and no significant effects on cognitive function. It is well absorbed orally, with a slow absorption rate and a half-life of 6-10 hours. Rufinamide is eliminated primarily through metabolism, with a low protein binding rate.

7. Rufinamide has been shown to be effective in reducing seizure frequency and severity in patients with LGS, with a significant decrease in total seizures and tonic-atonic seizures compared to placebo.

1. The study investigated the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards in central Spain. The populations differed in morphology and genetics, and the researchers hypothesized that interpopulational variations in chemical signals could lead to premating reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation. The study aimed to test this hypothesis through morphological, chemical, and behavioral analyses.

2. The researchers captured male and female lizards from five localities in the Madrid region and measured their morphological characteristics, including body mass, body size, head length, head depth, and number of femoral pores and blue ocelli. They found significant differences between populations in all morphological measurements, with lizards from the northern populations being larger and heavier than those from the southern populations. The number of femoral pores and blue ocelli also differed between populations.

3. The researchers analyzed the composition and proportions of chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions of males using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They found 53 lipophilic compounds, with steroids and carboxylic acids being the most abundant. The composition and proportions of compounds differed between populations, with 34 compounds shared by all populations and 19 compounds unique to specific populations.

4. The researchers conducted tongue-flick experiments to test whether males and females could discriminate between scents of lizards from different populations. They found that males and females from each population could detect scents of lizards from any population and responded differently to scents from males and females from their own population versus other populations. Males from the northern populations responded more to scents from northern females than to scents from southern females, and vice versa.

5. Males from the southern populations responded more to scents from southern females than to scents from northern females, but did not discriminate between scents from females within their own area. Males from the northern populations showed a clear discrimination and interest in scents from females from their own population against scents from females from other populations. Females showed similar patterns of response to male scents.

6. The results suggest that there may be premating reproductive isolation between some populations, particularly between the northern and southern populations. The differences in chemical signals and chemosensory recognition may contribute to reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation. However, further mating experiments are needed to confirm this.

1. The use of quantum dots (QDs) in whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) has been explored as an alternative to traditional chromogenic and fluorescent methods. QDs offer ideal optical properties, including strong fluorescent signal emission, narrow and tunable emission spectra, and resistance to photobleaching. This makes them suitable for detecting multiple mRNAs simultaneously. The study aimed to determine whether QDs can be used to detect endogenous mRNAs in Xenopus embryos.

2. The researchers encountered penetration issues with QDs, which were resolved by using proteinase K treatment to increase embryo permeability. This enabled specific deep tissue staining in whole-mount immunostaining experiments. The use of QDs with emissions in the near-infrared (NIR) region provided a significant improvement in detection sensitivity due to reduced tissue autofluorescence. However, commercially available QDs with NIR emissions are large and suffer from permeability problems.

3. The QD-based WISH protocol was tested using anti-digoxigenin-conjugated QDs to detect a dig-labeled RNA probe specific for Xenopus latent transforming growth factor-binding protein 1 (LTBP1). The staining pattern obtained was similar to the published pattern obtained using a chromogenic reaction. The QD labeling exhibited high signal intensity and resolution, confirming that a regular fluorescence microscope is sufficient for detection. The use of QDs for in situ staining can result in more accurate determination of transcript expression patterns.

4. The QD in situ protocol was further tested using biotin-labeled and FITC-labeled probes against different mRNAs, including amylase, endodermin (EDD), xbra, and myod. The staining patterns obtained were similar to those obtained using standard enzymatically amplified chromogenic reaction methods. The degree of resolution varied with the transcript of interest and its expression pattern. The use of QDs enabled distinction of intracellular localization patterns of mRNA.

5. The ability to detect two or more transcripts simultaneously using QDs was demonstrated by generating two probes, a FITC-labeled probe against xa-1 and a biotin-labeled probe against Xenopus cardiac actin. The two probes were hybridized and detected using spectrally distinguishable anti-FITC-conjugated and streptavidin-conjugated QDs, respectively. The resolving ability of this method is substantially better than that of amplified protocols.

1. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal disease with a low survival rate, and it is essential to develop accurate models to predict patient survival. The Cox proportional hazards regression model is a widely used method for survival analysis. This study aimed to develop and validate Cox models for PDAC patients using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The models were developed for localized and extended PDAC cases separately.

2. The study used data from 18,352 pathologically confirmed PDAC cases diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. The data were stratified into two groups: localized PDAC (LPDAC) and extended PDAC (EPDAC). The LPDAC group consisted of 5,422 cases with tumors localized within the pancreas, while the EDPAC group consisted of 12,930 cases with tumors extended beyond the pancreas. The proportional hazard assumptions were satisfied for all categorical variables in both groups.

3. The Cox regression analysis was performed for the LPDAC and EDPAC groups separately. The results showed that the performed treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, were the most beneficial for survival. The presence of metastasis, poor tumor differentiation, and large tumor size were the largest risk factors accelerating death from PDAC. Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race, and marital status, made modest contributions to survival.

4. The accuracy of the Cox models was assessed using the c-index and calibration plots. The c-index values were 0.702 and 0.712 for the LPDAC and EDPAC models, respectively. The calibration plots showed good agreement between the observed and predicted survival probabilities. The reproducibility of the models was evaluated using cross-validation with 10 repeats, and the results showed high reproducibility.

The results showed that the models were transportable to different regions, with c-index values ranging from 0.651 to 0.739. The averaged c-index values were 0.700 and 0.714 for the LPDAC and EDPAC models, respectively. This suggests that the models can be applied to different populations.

The study analyzed the preoperative variables associated with the prognosis of CLI patients undergoing PTA, including sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, infection, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and serum albumin level. The variables were compared between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

3. Diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than non-diabetic patients. The follow-up period was 90 ± 72 weeks, and 48 patients underwent major amputations and 89 died.

4. The leading cause of death was cardiac and vascular disease, followed by infection and unspecified causes. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared to non-diabetic patients, but similar life prognosis.

5. The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.101. Mortality was associated with age, impaired ADLs, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.

6. In diabetic patients, mortality was associated with age, impaired ADLs, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level. A1c level was independently associated with major amputation, with an adjusted HR of 1.349 in the 1% increment.

1. Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus, and it is common in areas where there is close contact between intermediate and definitive hosts, usually sheep and dogs. Humans acquire the infection by accidentally ingesting E. granulosus eggs voided in the feces of infected dogs. The disease presents with symptoms associated with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other viscera, and diagnosis is established by radiology and serology. The treatment of CE patients involves antihelminthic treatment and surgical procedures.

2. One of the problems encountered after treating CE patients is the risk of postsurgical relapses or treatment failure due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material, especially protoscoleces. Relapses in the form of newly developing cysts have been reported and may affect between 2 and 25% of cases after therapy. Postsurgical follow-up of CE patients for years is necessary to detect newly growing cysts as soon as possible. A posttreatment follow-up method should include markers that allow the detection of newly growing or relapsing cysts and tracking of previously undetected but still viable cysts.

3. Serology has been used for the post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies after recovery makes it difficult to diagnose relapse by serology. Many serologic techniques have been evaluated, including latex agglutination, passive hemagglutination, immunoelectrophoresis, and specific IgE, IgM, IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There is still a need to develop or improve immunodiagnostic tools to meet the requirements expressed by clinicians. One approach consists of searching for and identifying new antigens that specifically allow the classification of patients into cured and noncured categories.

4. The study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of CE, revealed by immunoblotting analysis. Blood samples were obtained from 50 patients with clinically/radiologically diagnosed CE, 40 non-CE patients with different parasitic infections and malignancy, and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The sera were divided into three tubes for each subject and stored immediately at -70°C until analysis. All CE patients were sampled one week before treatment and received antihelminthic treatment and underwent surgical procedures.

1. Obesity is a common metabolic disease worldwide, and dyslipidemias are among the most common metabolic disorders associated with obesity.
2. The study examined the relationship between obesity parameters or indices (BMI, WC, WHR, WHTR, BAI, and VAI) and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
3. The study consisted of 66 consecutively enrolled obese non-diabetic patients with a mean age of 55.8 years, including 40 women and 26 men.
4. Patients were divided into three groups according to their obesity level: class I (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m), class II (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m), and class III (BMI ≥40 kg/m).
5. The study found that patients with class III obesity had greater mean WC compared to class II and I, and higher mean WHTR, BMI, and BAI values compared to class II and I.
6. Negative correlations were found between BMI and TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C, while positive correlations were found between WC, WHR, and TG/HDL-C, as well as between VAI and TC, TG, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.
7. The study found that lipid disorders were the most frequent concomitant disorders in the study population, with dyslipidemia present in 90.9% of patients.
8. The study found that the group of patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum levels of TC and LDL-C compared with patients from the other two groups.
9. The study suggests that obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is significantly associated with dyslipidemia, which manifests itself mainly with reductions in HDL-C.
10. The study concludes that VAI is strongly related to lipid profile and may be the most valuable obesity index in obese patients with dyslipidemias.",1

2. The internet can be used for various purposes, including research, information seeking, communication, and business transactions, but it can also lead to addiction, excessive gaming, and gambling.
3. Internet addiction has been linked to various psychological and physical health problems, including depression, anxiety, and social isolation.
4. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of internet addiction and its association with psychopathology among college students in Mumbai.
5. The study used a cross-sectional survey design and included 987 students who were divided into three groups: moderate users, possible addicts, and addicts, based on their internet use patterns.
6. The results showed that males were more likely to be addicted to the internet than females, and that addicts used the internet mostly for social networking, academic purposes, and downloading media files.
7. The study found that internet addicts had poor mental, physical, and social health scores, and high anxiety, depression, and anxiety-depression scores.

1. The frequency response of the resonators was measured using a downmixing method, which involved electrostatic actuation of the device and application of a driving voltage to a side-gate parallel to the resonator. The drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency to reduce parasitic signals.

2. A bias voltage was used to down-mix the resistance change of the gauges, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier. Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.

3. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same set-up, with the drive electrode disconnected.

4. The Allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency. The phase of the measured signal was monitored for a certain amount of time and then transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.

5. Harmonics appearing at the frequency of the electricity supply were filtered out of data during post-processing. Using this method, n samples of the resonance frequency of the resonator were obtained, each averaged over an integration time, τ0.

6. The Allan deviation for this integration time was defined as σ(τ0) = √(1/2(n-1)) \* Σ(fi+1 - fi)^2. To obtain the frequency stability for higher integration times, the initial samples were averaged in groups of n samples, and the Allan deviation for the new array was calculated.

7. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth. The measurement set-up was based on the one described in supplementary section 3, but with each signal doubled using two drive signals at different frequencies, two bias signals, and two measurement signals.

8. The correlation coefficient of the filtered frequency traces was defined as corr(f1, f2) = Σ((f1,i - f1) \* (f2,i - f2)) / (n \* σf1 \* σf2), where f1 and f2 are the sample means of f1 and f2, respectively, and σf1 and σf2 are their standard deviations.",0

1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 29.4% of total deaths in 2010, and aspirin therapy is a prevention measure that can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. However, many studies have failed to ascertain whether individuals were recommended to take aspirin by their physician or took it on their own initiative.

2. The study analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2011-2012 to evaluate patient use of aspirin and reported physician recommendations of aspirin therapy for CVD prevention. The study found that less than a third of the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin.

3. Among primary-prevention patients, education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention. However, objective risk level was not associated with an increased risk of recommendation for aspirin, suggesting that decisions for treatment recommendations seem to be made on criteria other than objectively calculated future CHD risk.

4. The study found that only 40.9% of patients at high risk reported having been told by their physician to take aspirin, and patient reports of recommendations for aspirin use among secondary prevention patients was 75.9%, but still suboptimal. This suggests that there is a significant disconnect between who needs and who receives recommendations for aspirin use.

5. The study also found that access to care may play a role in recommendations for the advice of aspirin for CVD prevention, and the use of it by patients, with lack of health insurance being a significant barrier to accessing health care. Additionally, race and ethnicity had an impact among primary-prevention patients, with non-Hispanic whites more likely to receive a recommendation for aspirin than were Asians/others.

6. The study's limitations include relying on self-reported data, only examining adults age 40 and over, and not controlling for use of warfarin or other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy among respondents. Despite these limitations, the study highlights the need for improved clinical decision support and interventions to ensure that patients receive appropriate preventive care.",1

1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate signaling pathways and protein function through the oxidation of cysteine residues. The cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms.

2. Mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. However, the exact oxidative events required for the effects of ROS on these pathways are largely unknown.

3. Mitochondria and mROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs, with increased mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity observed during the differentiation of stem cells. Increased cellular ROS levels and oxidation products also correlate with the differentiation of various stem cell types.

4. The epidermis is a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium regulated by stem cell populations, and multiple transcriptional networks are associated with differentiation within the epidermis. The regulation of these factors is incompletely understood, and the role of cellular metabolism in this regulation is unclear.

5. The conditional deletion of TFAM in basal, undifferentiated epidermal keratinocytes resulted in impaired differentiation and an epidermal barrier defect, demonstrating that mitochondria play an active role in the regulation of epidermal homeostasis. Differentiation of wild-type keratinocytes was inhibited by antioxidant treatment, and differentiation marker expression in TFAM cko cells could be partly restored by treatment with exogenously applied H2O2.

6. mROS act as pro-differentiation signals and are key upstream regulators of stem cell fate decisions, with mROS generation required for activation of the Notch and β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth. The identities of the exact targets of oxidation which promote signaling remain unknown in most situations.

7. Nucleoredoxin (Nxn) is a putative target of mROS-mediated Wnt-β-catenin signaling, and its oxidation plays a causal role in the transduction of signals between Wnt receptors and β-catenin. Further studies are required to determine how mROS regulate Notch transcriptional activity during keratinocyte differentiation.

8. The development of regenerative therapies depends on the ability to maximize the renewal capacity of stem cells and promote complete differentiation into desired cell types, and cellular metabolism represents an intriguing rheostat which may be used to modulate",0

1. The study aimed to develop a reliable and simple in situ hybridization (ISH) technique for detecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues. The technique used a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAIi). The LNA probe was designed to target the highly conserved 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) of the HCV genome.

2. The study used humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice as positive controls, and FFPE tissue sections were prepared from these specimens. The mice were infected with different HCV genotypes, including 1a, 1b, and 2a. The ISH technique successfully detected HCV RNA in the human hepatocytes of these specimens.

3. The study also used needle biopsy liver specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis C, as well as specimens from patients with hepatitis B, fatty liver, and autoimmune hepatitis. The ISH technique was able to detect HCV RNA in 9 out of 11 chronic hepatitis C specimens, including three with diffuse cytoplasmic positivity and six with focal or partial positivity.

4. The study compared the results of the ISH technique with those of nested RT-PCR, which detected HCV RNA in 8 out of 11 chronic hepatitis C specimens. The ISH technique was able to detect HCV RNA in specimens that were negative by nested RT-PCR, suggesting that it may be more sensitive. However, the detection threshold may depend on the virus load.

5. The study found that HCV RNA was undetectable in hepatocytes in HBV-infected livers, non-viral liver disorders, and HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, more cases of HCC need to be analyzed to determine the distribution of the HCV genome in cancerous lesions.

6. The study concluded that the ISH technique using the LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe and CSAIi can be applied to detecting HCV RNA in liver biopsy specimens, with a sensitivity comparable to in situ RT-PCR. The technique is relatively simple and requires no special equipment, making it a valuable tool for routine histopathological diagnosis of HCV infection using FFPE liver biopsy specimens.",0

1. The thyroid system is a crucial aspect of vertebrate development, and its disruption can have significant consequences. The thyroid gland produces thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which play a vital role in regulating metamorphosis in amphibians. Disruption of the thyroid axis has been identified as an important consideration for the regulation of chemicals.

2. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to contaminants in wastewater discharged from agricultural fields and industrial and household areas due to their thin, permeable skin and aquatic environment. The dramatic structural and functional changes during metamorphosis can be applied as parameters reflecting endocrine disruption. The regulation of thyroid hormones (THs) is a critical aspect of this process.

3. The thyroid gland secretes T4, which is converted to T3 in peripheral target tissues, and transport of THs in the blood is accomplished through binding to transport proteins. There are several processes that influence the thyroid hormone balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation. Inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity can disrupt TH synthesis and secretion.

4. Exposure to certain compounds can disrupt TH metabolism, and there are many potential targets of environmental contaminants that could be involved. Sulfation and glucuronidation are two pathways that can reduce circulating levels of THs through biliary elimination. Deiodinase enzymes are found in several peripheral target tissues in amphibians and play a crucial role in TH regulation.

5. The binding of chemicals to transthyretin (TTR) can decrease the effective free concentrations of THs in plasma and change the apparent affinity for THs. This can diminish cellular uptake and biological responses and alter plasma TH homeostasis. Chemicals interfering with T3 binding to TTR may directly affect the free concentration of plasma T3 and its plasma clearance rate.

6. Amphibian metamorphosis is divided into three stages: premetamorphosis, prometamorphosis, and climax. During these stages, there are significant changes in TH levels, and the sensitivity to TH varies according to the developmental stage. The amount of spontaneously released thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is higher in late prometamorphic and climactic tadpoles than in early prometamorphic larvae and juvenile and adult frogs.

7. Several thyroid-disrupting substances have been tested for toxicity using amphibians, including inhibitors of T4 synthesis that inactivate peroxid",0

1. Cesarean sections (CS) performed without medical indication may contribute to higher rates of CS worldwide, and the World Health Organization recommends a CS rate of 10-15%. The actual rate of CS in many countries is far higher than the recommended range.

2. The debate on the best practices for minimizing postnatal morbidity continues, with conflicting views on the impact of mode of delivery on postpartum health. The postpartum period is critical for women, leading to physiological, emotional, and social changes.

3. Several studies have investigated the association between type of delivery and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), but the results are conflicting. Some studies report decreased HRQOL in CS, while others do not confirm any relation between CS and HRQOL.

4. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum physical and mental health-related quality of life. A prospective study was conducted on 365 pregnant women who admitted for prenatal care in a health center in Kashan, Iran.

5. The study found that women who underwent vaginal delivery (VD) had higher mean physical HRQOL scores than those who underwent CS at 2 months after delivery. The differences were significant for physical functioning and role limitation due to physical problems.

6. At 4 months after delivery, the VD group had higher scores in total physical health and total mental health compared to the CS group. The differences were significant for physical function, social functioning, and emotional well-being.

7. The study also found that the VD group showed more improvements on total mental HRQOL from time 1 to time 2 assessment. The mean score differences were significant for social functioning and emotional well-being.

8. The results of this study are consistent with several previous studies, but differ from some others. The study's findings suggest that VD leads to better physical health at 2 months after delivery and physical and mental health at 4 months after delivery.

9. The study's limitations include the use of a general instrument and not considering the type of CS, and future studies should include both general and specific questionnaires in assessing postpartum HRQOL among women with VD, elective CS, and emergency CS.",0

2. Safety needs, which include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being, are more fundamental than physiological needs and can block them.
3. The safety need is related to unexpectancy, and its induced emotion is the rapid detection of potential threats, which can initiate appropriate approach/avoidance behaviors.
4. The appraisal theory states that emotions result from people's interpretations and explanations of their circumstances, and the primary appraisal is related to fear and the secondary appraisal is related to anger.
5. The neural basis for safety is the amygdala and the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine (LC/NE) system, which can be regarded as a ""safety circuitry"" that elicits fear and anger emotions.
6. Fear and anger are two sides of one sword, acting in different directions: fear is to flight away from danger, and anger is to fight the danger away.
7. Mental disorders such as anxiety, phobia, depression, and PTSD are related to safety needs, and the inability to cope with unsafe stressful situations.

1. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model aims to provide quality, coordinated, and cost-effective care to patients, increasing access to services and improving practice efficiency and patient satisfaction. The model was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, and American Osteopathic Association. The PCMH is an extension of the Chronic Care Model, which was designed to address the increasing rate of patients with chronic conditions in the US.

2. To become a recognized PCMH, a practice must provide documentation of its guidelines for implementation and meet certain standards set by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). The NCQA standards do not offer instructions for practices to follow in making the transition, and each practice must create its own written policies that adhere to PCMH principles and fit its specific structure. The practice must then decide whether to attempt the transformation incrementally or all at once.

3. One of the challenges of implementing the PCMH model is promoting physician buy-in, as many physicians resist the change due to a lack of training, misaligned financial incentives, and time-consuming procedures. The model recommends that practice staff and providers take time to analyze patients' needs as a whole, and encourages team-based care and empowerment of ancillary staff. This team-based care has been shown to improve decision-making and patient satisfaction.

4. Implementing the PCMH model requires significant changes in office culture, including training for nurses and front office staff in their new roles. Patients must also be educated about the new healthcare structure and encouraged to participate in their own care. The model focuses on care coordination and documenting patient engagement in self-management, which has been shown to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

5. Despite the challenges, many PCMHs have reported success in improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs. The model has the potential to address the broken healthcare system in the US, but faces obstacles such as payment reform, professional support, and patient participation. Further research and education are needed to fully realize the benefits of the PCMH model.",1

1. The study analyzed the effectiveness of mild hypothermia therapy in improving the survival rate and neurological function of patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated. The therapy was found to improve the survival rate and neurological function of patients, but not at hospital discharge.

2. The meta-analysis included six studies with a total of 531 adult patients, and the results showed that mild hypothermia does not influence the incidence of rearrest, renal failure, pulmonary edema, and other adverse events. The therapy was found to be safe for cardiac arrest patients.

3. The possible mechanisms of mild hypothermia in improving patient prognosis include reducing cerebral oxygen consumption and energy metabolism, reducing reactive oxygen species generation, and preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. However, the study also acknowledged that the therapy may have side effects, such as reducing the rate of drug metabolism.

1. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with localized prostate cancer, but it can result in erectile dysfunction due to injury to cavernosal nerves. The cause of erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy was not well understood until studies by Walsh and Donker, who demonstrated that it occurred secondary to cavernosal nerve injury. These nerves are mainly concentrated laterally to the prostate and are referred to as neurovascular bundles.

2. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, with studies reporting a 16 to 76% recovery of erectile function in men whose bilateral neurovascular bundles were preserved. However, there is still controversy about the detailed descriptions of the exact periprostatic nerve distribution in the literature. The present study aimed to describe periprostatic nerve distribution and construct a 3-dimensional model of nerve distribution.

3. The study used five adult male human cadavers, and the prostate, seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum were removed en bloc and sliced into 5 mm step sections. The sections were embedded in paraffin, prepared, and stained with anti-S-100 antibody neural stain to delineate the precise location of neural tissue. Immunostaining with anti-S-100 protein antibody was performed to visualize the nerve fibers.

4. The stained whole-mount section slide was divided into four arbitrary sectors: two laterals, one ventral, and one dorsal (rectal side) according to one-fourth the circumference of whole-mount specimens. Each slide was taken from the base, mid-part, and apex of the prostate. Nerve fibers 100 micrometer or greater in diameter were counted in 200 magnification microscopically.

5. The average number of nerve fibers located in the ventral part of the prostate was 5.75±1.20, and the average number in the dorsal (rectal) part was 28.50±2.17. There were even fewer nerve fibers in the ventral part of the prostatic base area, numbering 3.75±1.38. The number of nerve fibers in the dorsal (rectal), right lateral, and left lateral parts of the prostate capsule showed no significant difference.

1. The study examined the relationship between serum amyloid A (SAA) levels and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SAA levels were found to be high in most RA patients, even in those with low or moderate disease activity, suggesting that sustained inflammation persists in many patients. The normal SAA level was found in only 10% of patients, who had lower inflammatory burden and normal QTc duration.

2. The study found that SAA levels were associated with disease activity, as measured by clinical and laboratory parameters, and were higher in patients treated with glucocorticoids. Women treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) had lower SAA levels than those treated with synthetic DMARDs, indicating better therapeutic effects. SAA levels were also higher in patients with advanced atherosclerosis and increased cystatin C levels, indicating increased cardiovascular and renal risk.

3. The study's findings suggest that SAA could be a biomarker for both disease activity and chronic complications in RA patients, including cardiovascular and renal involvement. High SAA levels were associated with increased risk of amyloidosis development and may play a pathogenic role in joint destruction and cartilage damage. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the observed relationships and to define the role of SAA in RA management.",1

1. The study investigates the role of perforin in granulopoiesis, specifically in the response to dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid that promotes inflammation and immune responses. Perforin-deficient (pfp) mice were used to examine the effects of dexamethasone on bone marrow cellularity, eosinophil and neutrophil counts, and thymus weight. The results showed that pfp mice have lower bone marrow cellularity, eosinophil and neutrophil counts, and thymus weight compared to wild-type mice.

2. The study found that dexamethasone injection increased eosinophil and neutrophil counts in wild-type mice but not in pfp mice, suggesting that perforin is required for the response to dexamethasone. The effect of dexamethasone on eosinophil numbers was abolished by ru486 pretreatment, indicating that the response is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. The thymus weight was reduced in both wild-type and pfp mice after dexamethasone injection.

3. The study also examined the effect of lymphocyte transfer from wild-type mice to pfp mice on the response to dexamethasone. The results showed that transfer of wild-type lymphocytes restored the response to dexamethasone in pfp mice, increasing eosinophil and neutrophil counts. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ cells from the transferred lymphocytes abolished the reconstitution of the response to dexamethasone.

4. The study suggests that perforin is required for the regulation of granulocyte lineages in vivo and that its deficiency leads to a selective defect in granulopoiesis. The defect is not due to a chronic inflammatory disease, such as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but rather to a lack of perforin expression. The transferred lymphocytes provide something that is lacking in the recipient, allowing for the reconstitution of the response to dexamethasone.

5. The study found that neutrophils were reduced in bone marrow and blood of pfp mice, suggesting that the defect is not due to increased export of neutrophils to the periphery. The colony-forming assays showed that there were fewer GM-CSF-responsive progenitors in pfp mice, indicating that production is greatly reduced. The defect is selective for granulocytes and does not affect total circulating leukocyte counts.

Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation blastocyst and expanded in vitro almost indefinitely without loss of pluripotency. They can differentiate into most somatic lineages, including cardiovascular lineages.

2. Induced pluripotent stem cells can be generated from adult somatic cells by overexpressing transcription factors critical for maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency. They can differentiate much like embryonic stem cells, yielding functional cardiovascular lineages from embryoid bodies in vitro and contributing to normal cardiovascular development from chimeric blastocysts in vivo.

They can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, and can be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. They can be rapidly expanded in culture, allowing for autologous transplantation.

4. Skeletal myoblasts can be harvested from muscle biopsies, expanded in culture, and autologously reimplanted. They are less prone to teratoma formation and are more resistant to ongoing ischemia, but true cardiomyocyte differentiation has not been observed in vivo. They may be incorporated into an infarct site, but their contractions are dyssynchronous due to failure of electromechanical coupling with the surrounding myocardium.

5. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in culture, and after transplant, they can supply a broad range of paracrine factors with proangiogenic, positive remodeling, and antiapoptotic properties. A meta-analysis of 18 randomized and non-randomized trials found that intracoronary infusion of adult bone marrow-derived stem cells improved left ventricular ejection fraction, decreased infarct scar size, and lowered left ventricular end-systolic volume.

6. The optimal timing of stem cell administration remains an important challenge, as stem cell survival may be compromised shortly after infarction by transient microvascular obstruction, recurrent ischemia, or reperfusion injury. Stem cell homing to the infarct border zone may be",0

1. The mineral polyhalite, with the chemical formula K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O, is commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions and rarely in volcanic successions. It was first described from the salt mine Bad Ischl-Perneck in Austria and has since been found in many salt deposits. Polyhalite is associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.

2. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee in Austria and later confirmed. Polyhalite can be synthesized under laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C. At lower temperatures, the dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C and reaches a maximum of 343°C.

3. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements like Zn, Cu, Ni significantly changes the dehydration reactions to higher or lower temperatures. Further chemical data on the conditions of formation and stability of polyhalite were presented by Krupp and Wollmann et al. Polyhalite most commonly forms early-diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite.

4. Polyhalite is stable between room temperature (25°C) and 255-343°C, which is within nearly the whole temperature range experienced by the Haselgebirge sulphates. Polyhalite contains potassium in stoichiometric amounts, making it interesting for absolute age dating. Since polyhalite was considered rare in most salt deposits, published ages are scarce and dating was carried out with other methods.

5. In the Alpine Haselgebirge, polyhalite is a minor but widespread and important constituent and is accessible in several salt mines, including the type locality of Bad Ischl, Hallstatt, Berchtesgaden, and Dürrnberg. Polyhalite mainly occurs intergrown with anhydrite or as vein fillings and in nodules, and recrystallized in foliated polyhalite rocks along shear zones.

2. Propofol, a widely used anesthetic, has been shown to have antioxidant effects and may protect against oxidative stress-induced ailments.
3. The study investigated the effects of propofol on the lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents.
4. The results showed that propofol administration did not significantly affect the levels of serum and renal and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) in the rats.
5. However, propofol significantly increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol, and decreased the levels of serum HDL-cholesterol in the rats.
6. Propofol also increased the levels of hepatic glutathione (GSH) and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the liver.
7. The study found that propofol increased the activities of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), indicating potential cardiac muscular damage.
8. Propofol had no adverse effects on the hepatic and renal tissues of the rats, as indicated by the insignificant effects on the levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST), and creatinine.

1. The study aimed to evaluate the apical extrusion of debris after using Protaper Universal rotary files (RFS) and different finishing files for removing residual root canal fillings.
2. The study used 80 samples, divided into four groups, with three experimental groups using Protaper Next (PTN), WaveOne (WO), and Self-Adjusting File (SAF) as supplementary files after RFS.
3. The results showed that all retreatment protocols caused apical debris extrusion, with WO exhibiting the highest extrusion, followed by PTN, and SAF exhibiting the least extrusion.
4. The SAF group was associated with a 12% increase in debris extrusion, which was significantly lower than the other two groups.
5. The study suggested that using supplementary files after RFS is important to refine the apical preparation and remove residual root fillings that can cause periapical extrusion of debris.
6. The SAF's design and continuous irrigation system may have contributed to its lower debris extrusion, while the WO's modified triangular cross-section and larger taper may have contributed to its higher debris extrusion.

In India, 22% of the population lives in high transmission areas, 67% in low transmission areas, and 11% in malaria-free areas. According to official figures, there are 0.71 million confirmed cases and 4001,000 deaths annually.

2. A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in RS Pura block of Jammu district in Jammu and Kashmir state to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding malaria among inhabitants. The study found that 97% of the study participants correctly associated malaria with mosquito bites, and a majority had knowledge of malaria symptoms, prevention, and treatment. However, there was a gap between knowledge and practice, with only 56% seeking medical help within 24 hours of a febrile episode.

1. Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy have revealed the dynamic folding of chromatin into hierarchical structures, including topologically associating domains (TADs), which are crucial for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. TADs are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions, and their boundaries are associated with specific features such as CTCF, cohesin, and histone modifications.

2. The boundaries of TADs serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, and their strength can be influenced by the binding of insulators and chromatin remodeling enzymes. The ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, has been shown to contribute to TAD boundary strength and regulate nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization.

3. BRG1 knockdown has been found to result in the reduction of nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions, leading to a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions and suggesting that BRG1 plays a role in regulating TAD boundary strength. The orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries may be achieved by enriched CTCF binding, which positions 20 nucleosomes around its binding sites.

4. The connection between BRG1, CTCF, and topoisomerases is thought to be crucial for TAD boundary formation and function, with BRG1 regulating nucleosome occupancy and topoisomerases facilitating supercoiling at CTCF sites. The interplay between these factors is essential for the organization of TADs and the regulation of genome architecture.",1

The study uses a cross-sectional design and collects data from 670 students at Iran University of Medical Sciences.

2. The results show that university average, quota system, and educational level are significant predictors of the number of failed courses and semesters, with higher university average and free quota system associated with fewer failed courses and semesters. The number of failed courses is also a significant predictor of the number of failed semesters.

3. The probes were introduced at positions T46C-CN and L54C-CN, which are close to the reaction center and the folate binding pocket, respectively.
4. The enzyme activity of the modified ECDHFR variants was found to be comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the probes did not significantly alter the structure or activity of the enzyme.
5. The study used a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, including vibrational spectroscopy, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations, to investigate the electrostatic environment in the active site.
6. The results showed that the electrostatic environment in the active site changes significantly during the catalytic cycle, with the largest changes occurring during the hydride transfer step.
7. The study found that the electrostatic contributions from individual residues and ligands to the active site microenvironment can be decomposed and analyzed using a mixed quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical approach.

1. The study evaluates the blood half-life of Resovist, a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle, using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) in rabbits. The results show that the MPI signal of Resovist in blood declines rapidly, with a half-life of around 5 minutes, and becomes undetectable after 30 minutes. This is in contrast to its use in MRI, where it has a longer half-life. The rapid decline is due to the clearance of particles that contribute most to the MPI signal by the reticuloendothelial system.

2. The study also compares the blood half-life of Resovist from two different manufacturers, Bayer Pharma AG and Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. The results show a significant difference in blood half-life between the two products, with Resovist from Irom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. having a shorter half-life. However, there is no significant difference in hydrodynamic diameter or size distribution between the two products. The difference in blood half-life is not fully understood and may be due to differences in particle clustering or formulation.

3. The study highlights the need for a dedicated MPI tracer with a prolonged blood half-life and ideal MPI characteristics. Resovist is not suitable for applications requiring a long circulation time of the MPI tracer in blood. The development of new SPIO tracers with improved pharmacokinetics and MPI performance is necessary. Standardized physicochemical testing protocols and cooperation between researchers are essential for the development of new MPI tracers.",1

1. The study investigated the host-pathogen interaction between Leishmania donovani and liver macrophages in vivo, focusing on the early response of macrophages to infection. The researchers used a tractable experimental model of Leishmania infection and isolated infected and uninfected macrophages from the livers of infected mice. They found that uninfected macrophages also underwent significant biological and gene transcriptional changes associated with the inoculation of live L. donovani amastigotes.

2. The study identified a gene network centered around retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) that is associated with the survival of amastigotes within the liver of L. donovani-infected mice. The RXRA network was found to be aberrantly maintained in infected macrophages, and perturbation of RXR in either direction via activation or suppression had similar effects on the growth of L. donovani in vivo. The mechanism by which this network controls parasite survival is currently subject to further investigation.

3. The researchers used a novel approach to study host-pathogen interactions, which is capable of revealing important host response pathways that would be invisible in studies of the interaction between macrophages and pathogens in vitro. They showed that manipulation of such pathways in vivo can impact parasite survival, reducing parasite load at early stages after liver infection. This approach has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets for leishmaniasis.

4. The study's findings have broader implications for the study of host-pathogen interactions and the development of therapies targeting nuclear receptors. RXR antagonists have shown efficacy in preclinical models of diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes, and RXR-mediated therapies may also be effective against leishmaniasis. Further investigations are needed to determine the mechanism of parasite growth arrest and/or killing and to explore the potential of RXR-mediated therapies for leishmaniasis.",1

1. The control of appetite is complex and involves the coordination of inputs from both physiological and environmental sources, with early theoretical approaches focusing on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, and adipose tissue. These formed the glucostatic, aminostatic, and lipostatic hypotheses.

2. More recent models have emphasized inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, and insulin, which account for the regulation of appetite and body weight. These models identify specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.

3. The major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing drive to eat and the intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signaling and tonic inhibition. This formulation is based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects.

4. An alternative approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance, which involves the inter-relationships between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI). This view stems from the statement that any increase in EE will be met with an equivalent increase in EI.

5. Exercise has a dual action on appetite control, causing a significant increase in fasting levels of hunger (a compensatory response) but also an associated increase in post-prandial satiety signaling from meals. This effect of exercise on appetite is likely to be quite different from any effect related to the lower intensity and more uniform tonic action of resting metabolic rate (RMR).

6. The relationship between RMR and daily EI mirrors the relationship between fat-free mass (FFM) and daily EI, suggesting that RMR reflects a physiological demand for energy that acts as a driver of food intake. This is consistent with Edholm's proposal that differences in food intake must originate in differences in energy expenditure.

7. The physiology of appetite regulation comprises three components: a tonic drive for food arising from the physiological demand for energy, a tonic inhibition arising from signals of energy storage (mainly adipose tissue), and episodic signals arising from the mouth and GI tract in response to the periodic consumption of food. This formulation is consistent with modern discoveries and incorporates the roles of adipose tissue and GI peptides.

The researchers collected water and mat samples from five shallow freshwater reservoirs and one stream in the foreland of Ecology Glacier, King George Island, Antarctica. The samples were analyzed for the presence of PHA synthase genes, which are responsible for PHA synthesis. The study found that more than half of the isolated strains possessed genes responsible for PHA synthesis.

2. The isolated strains belonged mainly to the phylum of Proteobacteria and represented classes Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The most frequently recovered group of isolates was members of the Pseudomonas genus, followed by the Janthinobacterium genus. The study found that six Pseudomonas strains and two Janthinobacterium strains possessed genes responsible for mcl-PHA synthesis. The amplification using PCR primers designed by Solaiman and co-workers showed that these strains possessed genes responsible for mcl-PHA synthesis.

3. The study found that two Janthinobacterium strains and two undefined Betaproteobacteria strains possessed genes responsible for scl-PHA synthesis. The DNA sequencing of PCR products obtained using g-d and g-1r primers proved that the studied DNA of these strains was responsible for scl-PHA synthesis. The nucleotide composition of PCR products amplified with orf2:i-179r primers pair has provided evidence that all are typical for phac1 gene coding for synthase responsible for mcl-PHA synthesis. The results of DNA sequencing of phac and phac1 genes were phylogenetically examined altogether with their closest relatives found in GenBank.

1. The operations required to reclaim arid and semi-arid lands involve modifying topography, creating suitable surface composition, and establishing vegetation. Establishing vegetation is the most uncertain aspect of land reclamation. Vegetation establishment is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, and allowing for productive reuse of the land. It also reintegrates disturbed lands into the existing landscape.

2. The uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment. Irrigation is expensive and not always successful, and even when plants are established with irrigation, they may lack water hardiness and die when the irrigation is removed. Natural rainfall can allow the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, albeit at densities similar to nearby undisturbed vegetation. Native species are now more recommended due to their long-term stability and resource value for wildlife.

3. The specific practices selected for analysis included seeding on May 15 onto bare soil in southern Arizona, USA. The seeds were assumed to be in the top 0.1 cm of the soil when the monsoon rains began. The soil type used in the simulations was a loamy sand, which is common in the region. No existing vegetation was assumed at the time of seeding, which had the simplifying effect of having evaporation as the primary evapotranspiration loss.

4. Germination and establishment were evaluated over the first 21 days, so competition among seedlings was assumed not to have an impact on plant growth or soil moisture in this period. Rainfall data from 1980 to 2010 came from two gages on the Santa Rita Experimental Range. The gages are 311 m apart and record the date, time, amount, and duration of each rainfall event.

5. The monsoon rainfall in this region was generally from convective cells, which can result in different amounts of rainfall, even over short distances, so the data from each gage were evaluated separately. Seven years of eddy flux data were available, including measurements of temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation, and soil temperature. The measurements were from the Santa Rita Mesquite Savanna site, which is also located on the Santa Rita Experimental Range.

Up to 40% of patients with MD do not respond to initial antidepressant therapy, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) evades a universally accepted definition. TRD patients are the primary candidates for neuromodulation therapies (NTs). NTs target specific brain regions implicated in MD and TRD.

1. The study explores the use of small RNA molecules, called short activating RNAs (sarnas), to regulate gene expression in stem cells. Sarnas are designed to target specific genes and activate their expression.

2. The researchers focused on two key genes, KLF4 and c-MYC, which are involved in stem cell maintenance and pluripotency. They designed sarnas to target these genes and tested their ability to upregulate their expression.

3. The sarnas were designed to target the promoter regions of the KLF4 and c-MYC genes, where antisense transcripts are often found. The researchers used a bioinformatic approach to identify potential antisense transcripts and design sarnas that could bind and degrade them.

4. The sarnas were tested in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and were found to upregulate KLF4 and c-MYC expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The upregulation was specific to the targeted genes and did not activate the interferon response.

5. The researchers used quantitative PCR and western blot analysis to confirm the upregulation of KLF4 and c-MYC expression. They also used nascent RNA analysis to show that the upregulation was due to true transcriptional activation.

6. The study found that the sarnas did not act through off-target effects, but rather through specific activation of transcription. The researchers used microarray analysis to examine the global gene expression profile and found that the sarnas did not activate the interferon response.

7. The researchers compared the gene expression profiles of MSCs treated with sarnas to those treated with lentiviral vectors overexpressing KLF4 and c-MYC. They found that the sarnas and lentiviral vectors had similar effects on gene expression, but with some differences.

1. Chronic kidney diseases can lead to end-stage kidney failure, characterized by changes in kidney structure and fibrosis, regardless of the underlying cause. Urinary tract obstruction is a common cause of chronic kidney disease, resulting in tubular atrophy or dilation, cell death, and interstitial matrix deposition. The hydrostatic pressure caused by the blockage initiates renal injuries.

2. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (Uuo) is an experimental rat model of renal injury that mimics the process of obstructive nephropathy. Taurine, an organic acid and major component of bile, has been shown to have beneficial effects on renal fibrosis in various kidney diseases. It also plays a role in ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, and antioxidant properties.

3. Paclitaxel, a plant-derived alkaloid, has been reported to ameliorate fibrosis in the Uuo rat kidney model and in liver fibrosis. It works by disrupting the microtubular network essential for cell division and other normal cellular functions, leading to cell death. Paclitaxel has also been shown to attenuate oxidative/nitrosative stress and glutathione depletion.

4. In this study, the researchers investigated the effects of taurine and taxol on tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a rat model of Uuo. The rats were divided into four groups: sham-operated, Uuo, Uuo + taxol, and Uuo + taurine. The kidneys were removed after 28 days, and stereological analysis was performed to estimate the volume and length of various kidney structures.

5. The results showed that Uuo led to renal disruption, tubular atrophy, degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis. Treatment with taxol or taurine reduced the volume of degenerative tubules and necrotic and fibrotic tissues. The volume of glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, distal convoluted tubules, Henle's loop, and collecting ducts was also reduced in the Uuo group.

6. Taxol treatment resulted in a greater preservation of kidney structures compared to taurine treatment. The volume of glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, distal convoluted tubules, Henle's loop, and collecting ducts was higher in the taxol-treated group compared to the taurine-treated group. The length of these structures was also longer in the taxol-treated group.

1. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses after sensing microbial components, and are necessary for protecting hosts from microbial infection. PRRs drive the coordinated activation of transcription factors, leading to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, type I interferons (IFNs), and antimicrobial genes. Aberrant activation of innate immune responses results in inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune disease and septic shock. The signaling pathways of the innate immune system are tightly regulated to avoid deficient or excessive responses.

2. Autophagy, a bulk degradation system, is induced after sensing various types of stress, such as nutrient starvation, protein aggregates, and microbial invasion. Autophagy enables the reuse of cellular components and the clearance of unfavorable substances, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the prevention of disease. Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) are recruited to the isolation membrane, a source membrane of autophagosomes, and play a vital role in driving the membrane trafficking necessary for autophagosome generation. Autophagy plays a critical role in host defense responses by promoting the elimination of pathogens and the induction of acquired immunity.

3. ATG16L1, an essential component of the autophagic machinery, is associated with the development of Crohn's disease. ATG16L1 forms an 800-kD protein complex with ATG12-ATG5 conjugates, and its self-multimerization is required for the recruitment of this conjugate into an isolation membrane. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex recruits an ATG3-LC3 intermediate to the isolation membrane, defining the site at which LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. Cells lacking ATG16L1 are deficient in the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, an essential process for autophagosome elongation.

1. The association between betel quid chewing and oral cancer was noted over a century ago, but it was considered a harmless practice in India until recent years when it emerged as a significant public health problem.
2. The introduction of tobacco by European settlers four centuries ago led to its mixing with betel quid, which increased the risk of oral cancer, and later studies established a causal link between the two.
3. Betel nut chewing was found to be responsible for oral submucous fibrosis, a precancerous condition, and the frequency of oral cancer increased among young adults due to the increasing popularity of gutkha chewing.
4. The incidence of oral cancer has increased among young adults in India, with 12.5 cases per 100,000 people, making it a major cause of cancer-related deaths in Indian men.
5. Despite efforts to educate the public and implement laws to reduce betel nut and tobacco usage, the habit remains widespread, and a permanent ban on gutkha and panmasala is necessary to eradicate the menace of oral cancer.
6. The study of 63 oral cancer patients found a direct relation between oral cancer and the duration of betel quid, gutkha, and panmasala chewing, highlighting the need for health education and a ban on these products.",1

1. The concept of patient blood management is gaining attention, and it is essential to reduce transfusions of blood and blood products, as they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, risk of severe postoperative infections, and high costs. In cardiac surgery, patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass are at risk of postoperative bleeding, and excessive bleeding may be caused by surgical factors and impaired haemostasis. The use of antiplatelet agents at the time of cardiac surgery carries both benefits and risks, and current international guidelines recommend discontinuing aspirin and clopidogrel before elective cardiac surgery.

2. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion policy has proven equally effective and possibly superior to a more liberal transfusion strategy, and the clinical consequence of storage lesions is a reduced survival time of red blood cells after transfusion. The evidence supports that each institution establishes its own patient blood management strategy to conserve blood products and maximize outcome, and newer transfusion guidelines in patients with coexisting cardiac diseases are similar to those in patients without such comorbidities. Institutions should evaluate how they approach transfusion and each physician should evaluate each patient for signs and symptoms of ischemia or imbalance in oxygen supply and delivery.",1

1. The process of neurogenesis involves the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neurogenic stem cells into neurons, and it was previously believed to only occur during embryonic life, but recent studies have shown that it can also occur in specific tissues like the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium even after birth. This process is essential for the regeneration of the olfactory epithelium and its projection into the central nervous system (CNS).

2. The olfactory epithelium has the ability to recover from damage, and this process is more efficient than in other parts of the nervous system, making it a promising area of research for neural regeneration. The olfactory epithelium contains a population of cells with stem cell-like properties, including globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs).

3. GBCs are small, round, morphologically non-descript cells that sit between the HBCs and immature olfactory receptor neurons, and they have been shown to proliferate at a high rate in the normal olfactory epithelium. GBCs are thought to be the cell population that multiplies and regenerates vigorously after epithelial damage.

4. The olfactory epithelium is a unique tissue that shares the same environmental niche as the CNS and has the same developmental hierarchy as neural cells, making it an ideal candidate for use in clinical research and therapy. The olfactory mucosa is easily accessible, can be biopsied for autologous cell transplantation, and regenerates completely without any loss of function.

5. In this study, six albino Wistar rats were used to obtain the olfactory mucosa, which was then dissociated into individual cells using enzymatic and mechanical methods. The cells were then cultured in a specialized medium that was optimized for epithelial cell proliferation and neurosphere formation.

6. The culture medium was composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, N2 supplement, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and L-glutamine, and the desirable viable cell density for obtaining optimum growth of epithelial cells was calculated to be 10^10. The epithelial medium was standardized to enhance the capability of the cells to propagate and form neurospheres.

7. The GBCs were isolated from the other epithelial cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and a specific antibody called GBC-III,",0

1. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in innate immunity and are derived from yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors. They invade the developing brain and mature into microglia, which are maintained through cellular division or expansion of progenitors. Microglia are distributed in the brain parenchyma and use motile processes to survey the microenvironment. They are involved in immune surveillance, phagocytosis, and synaptic pruning.

2. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of rapid depolarization of neurons and astrocytes, accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow and ion distribution. CSD can be elicited by various stimuli, including chemical, electrical, and traumatic means. Microglia express voltage-sensitive ion channels and are thought to sense electrical activity pertaining to CSD. They can be activated by CSD, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines.

3. The activation of microglia by CSD can lead to the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from neurons, which acts on toll-like receptors on microglia, leading to their activation. Activated microglia may contribute to neuroprotection through synaptic repair. The mechanisms by which microglia induce CSD remain unknown, but may involve potassium channels and calcium-activated potassium channels. Further research is needed to determine the role of microglia in CSD and its implications for brain tissue.",1

1. Transposable elements (TEs) were previously considered ""junk DNA"" but are now recognized as having played a crucial role in evolution through molecular domestication, generating new regulatory and coding sequences that allow for genetic innovation and organismal evolution. TEs have been domesticated to form new cellular protein-coding genes, and many examples of TE-derived genes have been found in vertebrates, including genes involved in placenta development, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

2. The gin genes, a pair of ancient vertebrate domesticated genes, have been derived from gin transposons that gained their transposase from the integrase of LTR retrotransposons. Gin1 and gin2 are present in different vertebrate sublineages, with gin1 found in mammals, birds, and reptiles, and gin2 found in tetrapods, bony fish, and sharks, suggesting important conserved functions in vertebrates.

3. The expression pattern of gin2 during zebrafish embryogenesis suggests a role during gastrulation, and functional analysis in fish is needed to determine its exact function. Further genome comparisons and functional gene analyses will likely uncover new domesticated genes and novel biological functions essential for the diversification of vertebrates and other living organisms.",1

1. Progressive diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, affect 45 million people worldwide and are expected to reach 76 million by 2030, with high societal costs and loss of life expectancy and quality of life.
2. These diseases are characterized by the aggregation of misfolded proteins, which can amplify and propagate from one cell to another, leading to a self-sustaining vicious circle of disease progression.
3. The spread and transmission of disease via misfolded protein aggregates is a widespread phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases, and not limited to the prion protein.
4. The toxicity of misfolded protein assemblies is due to their binding to and permeabilization of the cell membrane, as well as their ability to recruit and aggregate soluble proteins, leading to cell death and disease progression.
5. Different conformations of the same protein, such as alpha-synuclein, can lead to distinct diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting the existence of different strains of the protein.

1. Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for 5.7 million deaths, with 87% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The disease is multifactorial, with genetic influences playing a significant role in its pathogenesis. Epidemiological and animal studies have robustly recommended genetic influences in the development of ischemic stroke.

2. Beta-adrenergic receptors, specifically the 2AR gene, have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The 2AR gene has two major non-synonymous SNPs, rs1042713 and rs1042714, which cause changes in amino acid residues at positions 16 and 27 of the amino terminus. These polymorphisms have been associated with functional alterations in receptor function, influencing intermediate mechanisms for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

3. The present meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between the 2AR gene polymorphism and ischemic stroke. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using specific keywords, and studies were included if they met the predetermined selection criteria. Two investigators independently evaluated the title, abstracts, and search terms for eligibility.

4. A total of three studies involving 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls were included in the meta-analysis for allelic association, while 518 cases and 510 controls were included for genotypic association. The study characteristics are described in Table 1. The meta-analysis results did not show a significant association between the Arg16Gly polymorphism of 2AR and ischemic stroke.

5. However, the meta-analysis results did show a significant association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism of 2AR and ischemic stroke. The allelic association also showed a significant association between the Gln27Glu polymorphism and ischemic stroke. The results suggest that the Gln27Glu polymorphism of 2AR is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke.

6. The present meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence to support the view that carriers of the Gln27Glu polymorphism of 2AR demonstrate an increased risk of ischemic stroke. The results are in agreement with earlier published studies, but contradict two prospective cohort studies that failed to show a significant association. The discrepancy may be due to the variation in genetic variants among populations.

1. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a cancer prevention strategy used by women who carry germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes. The magnitude of the risk reductions in women with BRCA1/2 mutations who have undergone RRSO compared with those who have not is unclear. A fixed-effects meta-analysis of pooled results from 10 published reports of RRSO and the risks of breast and/or ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was conducted. RRSO was found to be strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

2. The summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies. Data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO. The search yielded 346 studies that were published between January 1999 and December 2007. No publications were excluded based on quality, sample size, language of publication, or other objective criteria related to study design and analysis.

3. A fixed-effects meta-analysis using the hazard ratios (HRs) and/or odds ratios (ORs) was conducted to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When two or more studies had overlapping study samples, only one published report from each group was included. The studies that formed the basis of this meta-analysis included case-control studies as well as prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Limitations of the currently available data regarding RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers include variable study designs, small sample sizes for individual studies, and short post-RRSO follow-up times in prospective studies.

4. Eight studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who were treated with RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment. Three nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who received RRSO relative to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive the procedure. The summary HR estimate was 0.49 (95% CI = 0.37 to 0.65). Four nonoverlapping studies estimated the risk reduction associated with RRSO for breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers",0

2. The results showed that IL-23 and IL-17 were overexpressed in OLP lesions, particularly in the epithelial layer, and were positively correlated with each other in reticular OLP lesions.
3. The study found that IL-23 stimulation increased the production of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells from OLP patients, suggesting that IL-23 contributes to the accumulation of Th17 cells and IL-17 production in OLP lesions.
4. IL-17 was found to selectively regulate the expression of certain inflammatory mediators, including human beta-defensins, chemokines, and TNF-alpha, in oral keratinocytes.
5. The study proposed a novel model of interaction between T cells and keratinocytes in OLP pathogenesis, where the IL-23/IL-17 axis plays a key role in the inflammatory response.

1. The isolation of pure populations of cells from heterogeneous cell suspensions is crucial in clinical and basic research, such as in the diagnostic test for HIV infection and in stem cell biology. The isolation of rare cells has become an active area of research, with the development of robust and efficient methods being a major contribution to stem cell biology. Miniaturized cell separation devices offer many advantages over conventional separation techniques, including small sample volumes, portability, low cost, improved sterility, and potential for integration with analytical techniques.

2. Cell separation techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: techniques based on size and density, and techniques based on affinity. Micro- and nanotechnology have enabled the development of novel size-based separation processes, such as the use of microfluidic devices with obstacles or channels of varied size. These devices are compact, simple, and do not require additional energy sources or equipment.

3. Differential motility in laminar flow has been used to separate motile sperm cells from non-motile sperm cells, with the motile sperm cells migrating against a laminar fluid stream. This approach does not require a power source, utilizing a height difference between the inlet and outlet as well as surface tension of the fluid stream to create a gravity-driven pump. The design has been proposed for home-based screening tests for infertility, vasectomy, vasectomy reversal, and sperm toxicology tests.

4. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) systems have been miniaturized, offering low cost and high throughput compared to conventional systems. Microfluidic FACS systems have been shown to operate comparably to their macroscale analogs in terms of purity and throughput. The incorporation of culture chambers in these systems reduces the risk of sample loss due to external handling or dead volumes.

5. Magnetic cell separation and sorting can be achieved on planar surfaces, with cells labeled with magnetic nanoparticles and separated using ferromagnetic strips. This approach has been used to separate leukocytes from red blood cells, with the potential for precise manipulation and positioning of cells at the desired location. Microelectromagnetic matrices have also been developed to separate nonviable yeast cells from viable cells.

6. Adhesion-based cell separation systems, such as cell affinity chromatography, can separate cell populations that have the same size and/or density. Microfluidic adhesion-based systems offer high surface areas per unit volume and short residence times, with the potential for high purity and throughput.

1. The diagnosis of cirrhosis is typically made through histological findings after liver biopsy, but imaging examinations can also be used to identify morphological signs of cirrhosis. Several studies have shown that these signs can be identified on routine clinical imaging examinations, including ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Knowing these signs and their diagnostic performance can be useful in clinical practice.

2. The caudate-to-right lobe ratio (C/RL), right posterior notch (RPN), and expanded gallbladder fossa (EGF) are three morphological signs that can be used to diagnose cirrhosis. These signs are the result of fibrosis and decreased blood flow within portal veins. The C/RL has been shown to have high specificity and accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis.

3. The C/RL is a quantitative measurement that requires contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging to identify portal vein bifurcations, which limits its use in clinical practice. The RPN and EGF are simple qualitative visual signs that can be easily identified on imaging examinations. The RPN is a sharp indentation on the posteroinferior liver surface, while the EGF is an enlargement of the pericholecystic space.

4. The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of C/RL, RPN, and EGF in 95 cirrhotic patients and 57 non-cirrhotic patients. The results showed that C/RL had a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 87%, and accuracy of 78% for diagnosing cirrhosis. The RPN had a sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 87%, and accuracy of 75%.

5. The EGF had a lower sensitivity of 49% but a high specificity of 91%. There was no statistical difference between C/RL and RPN in diagnosing cirrhosis, but both signs were significantly better than EGF. The study also found that EGF was less accurate in diagnosing cirrhosis in patients with viral-induced cirrhosis.

6. The study's results suggest that C/RL and RPN are useful signs in evaluating cirrhosis, especially in compensated and less severe clinical cirrhosis. The EGF is a useful additional finding that can be used in conjunction with other morphological signs. The study's limitations include the exclusion of patients with chronic liver diseases and the lack of correlation with the underlying cause of cirrhosis.

1. The study aimed to evaluate the ability of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and standard automated perimetry (SAP) to detect glaucoma progression in patients with glaucoma. The study included 462 eyes of 305 glaucoma patients and 62 eyes of 49 healthy controls. The patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including SD-OCT and SAP, at each visit during follow-up.

2. The study found that the ability to detect glaucoma progression by SD-OCT and SAP varied according to the number of tests performed during follow-up and the disease severity at baseline. The odds of detecting progression by SD-OCT were higher than SAP for eyes with less severe disease at baseline. Each 1 dB higher baseline mean deviation (MD) was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of progression being detected by SD-OCT versus SAP.

3. The study also found that the number of tests acquired during follow-up significantly influenced the ability to detect change. A higher number of tests during follow-up was associated with a decrease in the relative odds of progressing by SD-OCT versus SAP. However, there was a significant interaction between baseline disease severity and number of tests in explaining the relative odds of detecting change by SD-OCT versus SAP.

4. For eyes with early disease and a relatively small number of visits, the odds of detecting progression by SD-OCT were generally higher than the odds of detecting change by SAP. Conversely, for eyes with advanced disease and a relatively large number of visits available during follow-up, the odds of detecting progression by SAP were greater than by SD-OCT. The results suggest that SD-OCT performs better for detection of disease progression in early stages of damage, while SAP performs better for more advanced cases.

5. The relationship between ability to detect change and disease severity may be explained by a number of factors, including the nonlinear relationship between structure and function in glaucoma. The nonlinear relationship seems to be mostly the result of the logarithmic scaling of visual field data. Transformation of functional data to a linear scale or structural data to a decibel scale seems to produce a closely linear relationship between functional and structural measurements.

6. Another factor influencing the relative ability of structural and functional tests in detecting progression is the presence of floor effects. For SD-OCT average RNFL thickness measurements, a floor effect seems to occur when measurements are close to 50 μm, although there are variations according to specific instruments. When the floor is reached, even",0

1. The healthcare industry faces significant challenges, including the ""iron triangle"" of improving access, cost, and quality of care, and the ""valley of death"" between academic research and commercialization. New technologies and innovations are seen as a way to address these challenges, but research institutions are experiencing stress due to competition for funding. As a result, it is more important than ever to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in fundamental research and development.

2. The power of technology and innovation to enable step changes in performance while slashing costs is evident in examples such as Moore's Law in semiconductors. However, the pharma industry has seen a decrease in new drug approvals per inflation-adjusted R&D dollars spent, and labor productivity in healthcare is in decline. Successful innovation in healthcare requires navigating a long and challenging journey between basic research and commercialization.

3. The ""valley of death"" is often cited as a key obstacle for health innovations, particularly when government expenditures on early-stage research are not followed by commercially motivated investment. Technologies that emerge from academia without a promising commercialization pathway are often not considered by financially motivated investors. Financial investors are not impressed by technical results, but rather expect a clear commercial value proposition.

4. Many academic investigators are not prepared or motivated to think beyond their work in the lab to anticipate or address commercialization challenges. Some are even discouraged from considering commercial issues while conducting research due to concerns about aligning too closely with industry. As a result, academic innovators often approach translational research with a mindset of doing science rather than developing a product.

5. To address these challenges, institutions and funders are creating programs to assist academic investigators in advancing technologies toward commercialization. These programs provide educational opportunities to help investigators understand, anticipate, and address commercialization challenges. Examples include didactic educational programs, accelerators, and bridge/product development funding.

6. One approach is the development of Healthcare Commercialization Programs (HCPs), which attempt to strike a balance between advancing a project into commercialization and building the skills of team members. HCPs are designed to help teams develop a convincing pitch and articulate a viable commercialization pathway, or conclude that a ""quick kill"" is necessary. The goal is to focus available resources on teams with the highest likelihood of translational success.

1. Anal incontinence is a common and bothersome condition that affects daily life, causing hygienic problems, limitations in occupational and social life, sexual dysfunction, and reduced quality of life. The prevalence and severity of anal incontinence are measured by patient self-reporting, and no objective assessment methods exist. Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is a main cause of female anal incontinence, and multiple vaginal deliveries can increase the risk of anal incontinence regardless of anal sphincter injury. Age, obesity, and medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and gastrointestinal disorders also increase the risk of anal incontinence.

2. The prevalence of anal incontinence among women differs largely, ranging from 2.2% to 38.5% in previous studies, and differs between different study populations. Postpartum studies show a high prevalence of anal incontinence in women who have suffered from OASIS. Women attending gynecological outpatient clinics have a higher prevalence of anal incontinence compared to the general female population. Women with pelvic floor disorders have a higher prevalence of anal incontinence than women without pelvic floor disorders.

3. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors for anal incontinence in an unselected female population across parity groups in the second trimester of pregnancy. The study was part of a comprehensive perineum research study and was approved by the regional committee for medical research ethics. The study was conducted as a survey of pregnant women attending a free-of-charge routine ultrasound examination at a large university hospital in Oslo, Norway. The pregnant women attending the ultrasound screening represented a non-selected population from the entire Oslo area.

The major part of the questions was chosen from validated questionnaires. Additionally, demographic data, obstetrical history, educational level, household income, and country of origin of the participant were collected. Anal incontinence was identified by self-reported leakage of gas, loose, or solid stools, lack of ability to defer defecation for 15 minutes, use of pads or plugs, and alteration of lifestyle.

The study included 60 patients, divided into two groups: 30 normotensive patients (Group N) and 30 hypertensive patients (Group H) who were under medical treatment. The patients underwent elective surgeries of the lower abdomen, lower limbs, and perineum under spinal anesthesia.

2. The study found that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, weight, height, maximal height of sensory block, incidence of hypotension and bradycardia, or the amount of fluids infused. However, the number of patients with ASA II physiologic scores was higher in Group H compared to Group N. Antihypertensive medications used by the patients are also shown in Table 1.

3. The study measured the systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, as well as heart rate, at various time points before and after spinal anesthesia. The results showed that the blood pressure values were significantly higher in Group H compared to Group N at all measurement times. However, there was no significant change in heart rate compared to the basal measurements.

4. The study found that six patients in Group H and seven patients in Group N received atropine due to bradycardia, which resolved with a single dose of 0.5 mg intravenous atropine. In patients who developed hypotension, a single dose of 5 mg ephedrine treatment was sufficient. The incidence of hypotension was higher in Group H (6/30) compared to Group N (1/30).

5. The study's results support previous findings that effective antihypertensive treatment can reduce the incidence of hypotension following spinal anesthesia in hypertensive patients. The study's limitations include not measuring the basal sympathetic activities of the patients, which could have provided more insight into the results. Overall, the study found no significant difference between normotensive and hypertensive patients in the incidence of hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.",0

1. Chronic pain and depression are common health problems in primary care, and diagnosing them can be challenging. Pain is associated with significant limitations in daily activities and poor self-rated health. Depression is also associated with increased prevalence of pain. The coexistence of pain and depression can have significant consequences for treatment outcomes.

2. Dolotest is a validated pain- and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tool that integrates measurement of pain intensity with assessment of the impact of pain on eight 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS). The tool provides a visual profile (Dolotest-profile) that enables patients to take part in the evaluation of the test result and improve communication about their situation. The test results are also available as a Dolotest-score, ranging from 0 to 800. Dolotest has been developed to provide a shared understanding of the patient's situation.

3. The study aimed to determine the usefulness of Dolotest as a screening tool for depression in primary care and to find the sensitivity and specificity for Dolotest used for screening for depression. The study was conducted among patients visiting a primary care physician in Denmark, and 715 patients participated. The patients were asked to fill in the Dolotest and Major Depression Inventory (MDI) questionnaires. The study population was sociodemographically identical with no statistical significant difference between the gender and age distributions.

4. The results showed that 34.4% of the patients stated their visit was due to a pain problem, and 65.6% came for other reasons. There were statistically significant differences between the study group and control group in all domains. Women scored statistically significantly higher than men in all domains except for pain and problems with more strenuous activity. The Dolotest-score was statistically significantly higher for women in the whole study population and also for the control group.

5. The prevalence of patients with depression was 16.1% of all patients, and 26.8% of patients whose visit was due to pain met depression criteria. The prevalence of depression was statistically significantly higher for both genders in the group visiting primary care physician because of a pain problem than for other problems combined. The findings are in good correlation with the literature, though this study captures the pain intensity during the last week, not necessarily persistent pain.

1. The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage pattern in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genomes and found that mutation pressure is the main force shaping its codon usage bias, with nucleotide composition being the primary factor influencing codon usage patterns.
2. The analysis revealed that HMPV has a distinct codon usage pattern compared to its host, human cells, and avian metapneumovirus (AMPV), with a complementary trend observed between HMPV and human cells, which may benefit virus replication and persistence.
3. The study's findings provide insights into the molecular evolution and pathogenicity of HMPV, suggesting that codon usage bias may associate with its pathogenicity and that phylogenetic difference and host factors play important roles in shaping its codon usage pattern.",1

1. Delirium is a common and severe complication among elderly patients, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased risk of post-discharge institutionalization and dementia. Identifying accurate biomarkers for delirium may shed light on its pathophysiology and improve delirium recognition and care. Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission might be involved in the pathophysiology of delirium. The study aimed to investigate BH4 status, potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the production of NO in patients with and without delirium.

2. The study included 86 patients who were admitted to the wards of internal medicine and geriatrics, and exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, and ongoing treatment with antipsychotics or other psychiatric medications. Blood samples were collected within 48 hours after admission, and plasma amino acid levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The diagnosis of delirium was made by a geriatrician according to the DSM-IV, and cognitive functioning was assessed using the MMSE. Physical and instrumental functionality were assessed using the Katz Activities of Daily Living scale and the Barthel index.

3. The study found that patients with delirium had significantly lower levels of arginine and citrulline, and higher Phe/Tyr ratios, suggesting a deficiency in the essential cofactor BH4 for the production of serotonin, dopamine, and NO. The study also found that patients with delirium had a decreased Trp/LNAA ratio, which might suggest reduced serotonin production in the central nervous system. However, no associations were found between the other amino acids and ratios and delirium. The study's findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and an increased status of oxidative stress may have played a role in the pathogenesis of delirium.

4. The study's limitations include the small sample size, and the possibility that the degree of patients' cognitive functioning influenced the mean levels of the biochemical parameters. Additionally, the study did not focus on one but on several possible pathways that might lead to delirium, and more research is needed to explore the potential differences in the pathophysiology of delirium in patients with and without cognitive disorders. Confirmation of the study's results in a larger, comparable population is recommended. The study's findings may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the",1

1. The study investigated the personal and neighbourhood environmental characteristics associated with active transport among inhabitants of Dutch deprived neighbourhoods.
2. The results showed that age, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) were significant personal characteristics associated with active transport, with younger participants, migrants, and those with a lower BMI being more active.
3. Neighbourhood characteristics, such as perceived speed of traffic and neighbourhood surroundings, were also found to be associated with active transport, with lower perceived speed of traffic and more attractive neighbourhood surroundings promoting more walking and cycling.
4. Interactions between personal characteristics and neighbourhood variables revealed that migrants and women were more responsive to neighbourhood walkability, and that low perceived speed of traffic was associated with more walking among younger respondents.
5. The study's findings support previous research that personal characteristics are stronger associates of active transport than neighbourhood characteristics, but also highlight the importance of considering neighbourhood characteristics in promoting physical activity, particularly among certain subgroups.
6. The study's limitations include its cross-sectional design, low response rate, and use of self-reported measures of active transport, which may be prone to recall bias and socially desirable answers.
7. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the associations between neighbourhood characteristics and patterns of physical activity in deprived neighbourhoods, which can inform the development of effective interventions to increase active transport and physical activity levels.",1

1. Optic neuritis is an acute optic neuropathy that occurs in young people, especially women, and is a common first clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis (MS). The clinical picture shows a decline in visual acuity, pain that increases with eye movements, and changes in the visual field.

2. The study aimed to determine the onset of optic neuritis as the first MS clinical presentation and to analyze the role of morphometric changes in the optic nerve and visual field using optic coherent tomography (OCT) and computer perimetry. The study also aimed to determine the efficiency of pulse corticosteroid therapy in these patients.

3. The study found that optic neuritis was most often present in patients aged 18-30 years, and the onset of optic neuritis was more frequent in female patients (70%) compared to male patients. The first clinical manifestation of MS in the sample was statistically significant, confirming that optic neuritis is one of the first clinical manifestations of MS.

4. The study analyzed ophthalmological parameters, including visual acuity, visual field, and thickness of the peripapillary rim nerve fibers, and found that centrocecal scotoma was the most frequent disturbance in the visual field. After three months, OCT results showed thinning of the nerve fibers in the whole circumference, most often in the upper quadrant.

5. The study found that pulse corticosteroid therapy significantly improved visual acuity in all patients with optic neuritis, with visual acuity ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 after one month. The therapy also prevented relapse and had the same effect on definite visual acuity as corticosteroids orally administered.

6. The study's results are consistent with other studies, which have shown that optic neuritis is a common first clinical presentation of MS, and that corticosteroid therapy is effective in improving visual acuity and preventing relapse. The study's findings also support the use of OCT in detecting nerve fiber atrophy in MS patients with optic neuritis.",1

1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population, with diabetes affecting approximately 25% of individuals with SMI. Factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications contribute to this increased prevalence. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) promotes preventive and population-based care, which can help address this issue.

2. The ACA's Section 2703 established health home programs to provide services that reduce barriers to care for individuals with chronic conditions. Individuals with SMI face chronic impairments and difficulties, making health home programs a potential solution to improve early recognition of developing problems and access to preventive somatic care. Placing health homes within mental health clinics can maximize exposure to health home services.

3. This case study presents preliminary results on a new behavioral health home (BHH) that focuses on population-based care to identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and provide individualized interventions for individuals with SMI. The BHH aims to improve the quality of somatic care and identify gaps in care. The study hypothesizes that BHH services will lead to better health outcomes for patients with SMI.

4. The BHH was embedded in the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, which serves 2000 individuals annually. The division consists of two large outpatient mental health clinics, an adult and child assertive community treatment (ACT) team, and an adult psychiatric rehabilitation program (PRP). Efforts to enhance somatic care for patients with SMI have been a top priority since 2005.

5. Behavioral health home referrals were made to patients who required the most assistance, including those enrolled in intensive ACT or PRP services. Individuals in these services were referred to the BHH staff by their mental health provider, and those who consented received an intake and were enrolled in BHH services. A minimum of two BHH services per month were provided, coordinated by a nurse case manager.

6. A wide variety of services qualified for BHH services, including care coordination, comprehensive transitional care, and health promotion. One service per month was allowed to be delivered in a group format, which led to the creation of a population-based health management program targeting highly prevalent somatic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Monitoring a specific health condition for several consecutive months provided a better understanding of the population's care needs and impact of interventions.

1. The article discusses Valerie Oppenheimer's theory that men's economic position affects their likelihood of getting married, and how this theory has been tested and supported in the American context. The theory suggests that men's economic uncertainty and instability can lead to delays in marriage.

2. The article aims to test Oppenheimer's theory in the European context, using data from the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and examining the effects of men's employment, income, work experience, and type of labor contract on union formation. The study covers 13 European countries and uses discrete-time event-history analysis.

3. The study finds that men's economic position has a significant impact on union formation, with employment, income, and work experience all positively affecting the likelihood of entering a union. The effects of men's economic position are stronger for marriage than for cohabitation.

4. The study also examines the effects of men's economic position on the transition from cohabitation to marriage, and finds that men's income and work experience are positively associated with this transition. The effects of men's economic position are weaker for this transition than for union formation.

1. The study evaluated the frequency of symptoms in patients with vivax malaria before and after treatment with chloroquine and primaquine, and found that fever, chills, sweating, and weakness were the most common symptoms before treatment. After treatment, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain.

2. The study also found that gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste, and weakness increased significantly after initiation of antimalarial treatment. These symptoms may be related to the side effects of chloroquine and primaquine, which can lead to reduced treatment adherence.

3. The use of primaquine can cause hemolytic anemia, particularly in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is prevalent in certain populations. In this study, the frequency of choluria (dark urine) increased significantly after primaquine was started, which may be related to hemolytic anemia.

4. The study highlights the importance of warning patients about possible side effects of chloroquine and primaquine, and seeking measures to minimize them. Healthcare personnel should also be aware of the risk of severe hemolysis after primaquine use, particularly in areas where G6PD deficiency is common.",1

1. The study examined the effects of combining alpha-blocker tamsulosin with antimuscarinic agent solifenacin on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The results showed that the combination therapy improved LUTS, but did not significantly improve sexual function.

2. The study found that the improvement in storage symptoms of LUTS was associated with improved sexual function in patients treated with tamsulosin alone, but not in those treated with the combination therapy. This suggests that the addition of solifenacin may have masked the potential beneficial effect of tamsulosin on sexual function.

3. The study's findings suggest that concomitant treatment with alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics may be effective for improving LUTS in patients with BPH, but may not have a significant impact on sexual function. Further studies are needed to fully understand the relationship between LUTS and ED and to develop effective treatments for both conditions.",1

1. The mir-200c microRNA plays a crucial role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype in cancer cells by repressing the transcription factor ZEB1, which is involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mir-200c also represses other genes involved in polarity, migration, and invasion, such as fibronectin, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, and class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3). The loss of mir-200c expression is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, including increased migration, invasion, and chemoresistance. Restoration of mir-200c expression in cancer cells leads to a decrease in migration, invasion, and chemoresistance.

2. The study demonstrates that mir-200c-mediated repression of TUBB3 is the mechanism behind the increased chemosensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents such as paclitaxel. Mir-200c also affects adhesion to substrates, including basement membrane complex and laminin, which is relevant to ovarian cancer. The effects of mir-200c on migration, invasion, and adhesion are independent of E-cadherin expression. Overall, the study highlights the importance of mir-200c in maintaining the epithelial phenotype and its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",1

1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using a midurethral sling (MUS) was first described by Delorme to prevent complications associated with the retropubic MUS placement. A similar transobturator passage using an inside-out approach was later described by De Leval to further reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence. Multiple studies have discussed the anatomical trajectories of both obturator approaches and confirmed their anatomical safety from a neurovascular perspective.

2. The aim of this cadaveric study was to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches. To allow such a comparison, CT-scan image analysis was performed after tantalum wire-marked mesh slings were implanted in a series of cadavers. The study found that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior. The out-in MUS were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the in-out MUS.

3. The study measured the angle formed by the two legs of the MUS tape and found that the in-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach. The mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the in-out MUS measured 122, versus 144 for the out-in MUS. The paired differences between the tapes' inner angles were significantly different, with a mean difference of 19.8. Correlation analysis only showed a trend between the out-in and the in-out MUS angle.

4. The study's findings have clinical implications, suggesting that surgeons must pay more attention to the 2nd half of the helical pass, whichever way they choose to go. The advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography will allow for similar measurements of the different tapes' trajectories in vivo in a dynamic setting, possibly allowing correlation of these findings to nuances in clinical outcomes. Ultrasound will not be able to provide the same holistic visualization within the bony pelvis, but mesh-tape beyond the obturator membrane probably does not contribute to the MUS functional effect or possible adverse events at the level of the vagina. The study's results can be used to improve surgical techniques and reduce complications.",1
