0,"To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market each day, we need to calculate how many eggs she sells daily.

1. **Total eggs laid per day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Eggs used for breakfast:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.

3. **Eggs used for baking:** Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.

4. **Eggs available for sale:** To find out how many eggs are available for sale, we subtract the eggs used for breakfast and baking from the total eggs laid:

   \[
   \text{Eggs available for sale} = \text{Total eggs laid} - \text{Eggs used for breakfast} - \text{Eggs used for baking}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Eggs available for sale} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9
   \]

5. **Income from selling eggs:** Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily income from selling eggs is:

   \[
   \text{Income} = \text{Eggs available for sale} \times \text{Price per egg}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Income} = 9 \times 2 = 18

2,"To determine the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Investment:**
   Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, his total investment is:
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Increased Value of the House:**
   The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the new value of the house is 150% more than the original purchase price of $80,000. To find the increased value, we calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original price:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price (new value of the house) and the total investment:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles. On the second day, they travel northward for 150 miles. Since the directions are perpendicular to each other (west and north), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), the relationship is given by:

\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

In this scenario:
- \(a = 80\) miles (distance traveled westward)
- \(b = 150\) miles (distance traveled northward)

Substituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem gives:

\[
c = \sqrt{80^2 + 150^2}
\]

Calculating the squares:

\[
80^2 = 6400
\]
\[
150^2 = 22500
\]

Adding these results:

\[

19,"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to determine the total time she has to complete the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

1. **Calculate the total time allowed:**
   - The total distance is 12 miles.
   - The desired average speed is 4 miles per hour.
   - Total time allowed = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

2. **Determine the time already spent:**
   - Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
   - She took another hour to walk the next 2 miles.
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time allowed is 3 hours.
   - Time already spent is 2 hours.
   - Remaining time = Total time allowed - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

4. **Determine the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance is 12 miles.
   - Distance already covered is 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance is 6 miles.
   - Remaining time is 1 hour.
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the remaining distance to achieve her desired average speed.

20,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water is in the remaining mixture after the spill.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the original orange drink:**

   The orange drink is two-thirds water. Originally, there are 10 liters of orange drink. Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters of water}
   \]

2. **Account for the spill:**

   You spill 1 liter of the orange drink. Since the orange drink is uniformly mixed, the proportion of water in the spilled drink is the same as in the original drink. Therefore, the amount of water in the spilled 1 liter is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \text{ liters of water}
   \]

   Thus, the amount of water remaining in the orange drink after the spill is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ liters of water}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**

   The pineapple drink is three-fifths water. There are 15 liters of pineapple drink. Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters of water}
   \]

4. **Combine the drinks:**

   After the spill, you have 9 liters of orange drink left (since 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters) and 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total volume of the mixture is:
   \[
   9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
   \]

   The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
   \[
   6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters of water}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is \(\boxed{15}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. Henry's total bike trip was 60 miles.
2. He made his first stop after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, let's find out where the second stop occurred. Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, we subtract 15 miles from 60 miles:

\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means Henry's second stop was at the 45-mile mark.

Now, we need to calculate the distance between the first stop and the second stop. The first stop was at 20 miles, and the second stop was at 45 miles. Therefore, the distance between the first and second stops is:

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This can be expressed as:

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( g + s = 110 \)
2. \( g = s + 30 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( g \) from the second equation into the first equation:

41,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone and then calculate how far outside the dragon's flame reach she can stand.

1. **Determine the throwing distance with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - Holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.
   - Therefore, with the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin: 
     \[
     3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the safe distance outside the dragon's flame reach:**
   - The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet.
   - Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone.
   - To find how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand, subtract the flame reach from her throwing distance:
     \[
     1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

1. **Determine Remaining Calorie Allowance:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, your remaining calorie allowance is:
     \[
     2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate Calories per Gram of Chips:**
   - The bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving contains 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the entire bag are:
     \[
     5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories}
     \]
   - The entire bag weighs 300 grams.
   - To find the calories per gram, divide the total calories by the total weight:

44,"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles, we need to calculate both his total revenue and his total costs, and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 candles.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \text{Net Profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
45,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many articles Meredith wrote each day and then calculate the total number of hours she spent writing.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.
   - The number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 5\right) = 5 + 2 = 7
     \]
   - So, she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles on Wednesday as she did on Tuesday.
   - The number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
     \]
   - So, she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
\text{Total articles} = 5 \, (\text{Monday}) + 7 \, (\text{Tuesday}) + 14 \, (\text{Wednesday}) = 26
\]

Each article takes 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing is:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 26 \times 4 = 104

46,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Post-it notes Candice used and how many she had in total after purchasing the package.

1. **Initial Post-it Notes:**
   Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

2. **Post-it Notes Used:**
   At work, she placed a Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes:**
   After using the Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

4. **Total Post-it Notes After Purchase:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After purchasing the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had was the initial 80 plus the \( x \) from the package.

   Therefore, the equation representing the situation is:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   x - 140 = 23
   \]
   \[
   x = 23 + 140

47,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many blue and red ties John bought and how much he spent on each type of tie.

First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. We know that he spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. Therefore, the number of blue ties he bought is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John bought 5 blue ties.

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

John bought 10 red ties.

The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Each red tie costs $60.

Now, let's calculate how much John spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

John spent $600 on red ties.

Finally, to find out how much John spent on all the ties, we add the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent on ties} = \text{Total amount spent on blue ties} + \text{Total amount spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

48,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 4-foot long wire.

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, we can convert 4 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we have a total of 48 inches of wire. We need to cut this wire into pieces that are each 6 inches long. To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy can obtain 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, from the original 4-foot wire.

49,"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:
     \[
     \text{Total units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - To find the number of occupied units, multiply the total number of units by the fraction that is occupied:
     \[
     \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
     \[
     \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units}
