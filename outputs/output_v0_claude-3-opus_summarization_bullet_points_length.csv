• This paper studies the transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems called ratchets, which are asymmetric periodic potentials that can produce directed transport of particles.
• The behavior of these systems depends sensitively on parameters and can exhibit chaos, bifurcations, and coexisting attractors.
• The current, defined as the time-averaged velocity over an ensemble of particles, can reverse direction depending on parameters like the forcing amplitude.
• A previous conjecture suggested current reversals are correlated with bifurcations between chaotic and periodic behavior, but later work argued current reversals can occur without such bifurcations.
• This paper shows the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble of particles, especially near bifurcation points, and that transient behavior must be discarded to get consistent results.
• While current reversals are not always associated with bifurcations, the paper finds evidence that bifurcations are generally associated with abrupt changes or spikes in the current.
• The physical basis is that transport in chaotic systems is sensitive to parameters, especially near bifurcations when the single-particle dynamics undergoes a transition.
• Some open questions remain about violations of these heuristic rules, but they provide a useful framework for characterizing the complex transport properties of chaotic ratchets.

* This study investigated the possibility of additional planets in six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems using dynamical simulations and observational data.
* The six systems studied were HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B, each of which hosts a planet with eccentricity greater than 0.6.
* Observations from the McDonald Observatory and other sources were combined and fit with Keplerian orbits, revealing no evidence for additional objects in any of the systems.
* Test particle simulations were performed to determine regions where additional low-mass planets could remain in stable orbits in the presence of the known eccentric planet.
* The simulations showed that for the short-period planets HD 3651 and HD 37605, test particles remained stable near the 1:2 and 1:3 mean-motion resonances with the known planet.
* For the longer-period planets HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744 and 16 Cyg B, test particles were only stable in limited regions interior and exterior to the known planet's orbit.
* Detection limit calculations based on the observational data constrained the masses of additional planets that could exist in the stable regions identified by the simulations.
* For HD 3651, HD 45350, and 16 Cyg B, planets with masses of a few Neptune masses could be ruled out in the stable regions.
* The study demonstrates that combining dynamical simulations with observational detection limits is an effective way to constrain the presence of additional planets in known planetary systems.

In the allowed parameter space, the branching ratio can reach 10−5 for Z→A0γ, 10−8 for Z→A0A0 and 10−9 for Z→A0A0A0, implying the first two decays may be accessible at the GigaZ option.

For the NMSSM and nMSSM, the constraints are more complicated since they involve both Higgs bosons and sparticles. The muon g-2 requires a light A0 with enhanced couplings to explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment.

* Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It predicts the existence of superpartner particles, which should have masses below the TeV range to maintain naturalness. The mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.

* The authors focus on the no-scale type Kähler potential, in which the hidden and observable sectors are separated. In this scenario, scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes, with gaugino masses being the only source of SUSY breaking. This leads to a highly predictive scenario with suppressed SUSY contributions to flavor-changing neutral currents.

* The no-scale structure of the Kähler potential is obtained in various models, including some classes of string theory and the sequestered sector scenario with two branes in a five-dimensional setting. Phenomenological aspects of the no-scale scenario have been investigated in the literature, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum, direct search bounds, and cosmological constraints. The authors consider three cases for the boundary conditions: universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, above the GUT scale, and non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale.

They consider three cases: universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale (minimal scenario), universal gaugino masses above the GUT scale, and non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale. In the minimal scenario, the cosmological constraint is severe, while in the other two scenarios, the constraint is not as severe.

* The authors further constrain these models using the current lightest Higgs mass bound and the branching ratio for b → sγ.

* This paper analyzes the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities in the interaction region of colliding plane waves with cross polarization, known as the CPBS spacetime. The singularities are probed using three types of test fields: electromagnetic (EM) fields, scalar fields, and null dust fields. According to the Helliwell-Konkowski (HK) conjecture, QR singularities are predicted to be unstable and transform into non-scalar curvature singularities (NSCS) or scalar curvature singularities (SCS).

* For test EM fields, the HK conjecture predicts that QR singularities in the incoming region of the CPBS spacetime become unstable and transform into NSCS. However, the exact back-reaction solution shows that besides true singularities on the null boundaries, there are still QR singularities in the incoming regions, while the interaction region interior remains singularity-free with a Killing-Cauchy horizon. The conjecture fails to predict the correct singularity nature in the interaction region.

* Test scalar fields have a stronger effect on QR singularities compared to EM fields. The QR singularities are found to be unstable and transform into SCS according to the HK conjecture. To verify this, a new exact back-reaction solution representing the collision of cross-polarized EM fields coupled with a scalar field is constructed.

* Analysis of the Weyl and Maxwell scalars in the new solution confirms that they diverge as the singularity is approached, and the conjecture correctly predicts the formation of an SCS, unlike the test EM field case. This demonstrates the validity of the HK conjecture for test scalar fields in the CPBS spacetime.

* Test null dust fields are introduced into the interaction region of the CPBS spacetime. The HK conjecture predicts that the Cauchy horizons are unstable and transform into SCS. This result is compared with an exact back-reaction solution, confirming that the conjecture works correctly for null dust fields.

* The paper investigates the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals, called T-states. The authors develop a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on T-states using the steering ellipsoid formalism and conjecture it is optimal.

* The paper discusses three notions of non-locality for bipartite quantum states: Bell-nonlocality, EPR-steerability, and non-separability. For mixed states, these form a hierarchy where the set of separable states is a strict subset of non-EPR-steerable states, which is a strict subset of Bell-local states.

* The authors find a remarkable connection between their LHS model and the steering ellipsoid for T-states. They obtain a strong necessary condition for a T-state to be EPR-steerable based on the harmonic mean radius of the ""inverse"" steering ellipsoid.

* The authors also derive two sufficient conditions for T-states to be EPR-steerable using EPR-steering inequalities. These conditions touch the necessary condition in some regions, and the gap between them is quite small elsewhere.

* The authors prove an equivalence between the necessary condition for EPR-steerability and a geometric condition involving the steering ellipsoid. They provide an explicit formula for the normalization constant in their LHS model.

* The authors demonstrate a linear EPR-steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix of any two-qubit state. Violation of this inequality is a sufficient condition for the state to be EPR-steerable.

* The authors conclude by discussing open questions, such as proving the optimality of their LHS model, extending it to arbitrary two-qubit states and POVM measurements, and the difficulty of the latter even for Werner states. They suggest the steering ellipsoid may provide intuition for approaching these generalizations.

• The first person to propose using electron spin to encode binary information is unknown, though Richard Feynman may have mentioned the idea around 1985. Concrete schemes for spintronic logic gates did not appear until the mid-1990s.
• Encoding information in spin could have advantages over charge-based devices, including lower power dissipation, less coupling to electric fields and noise, and faster operation not limited by charge transit time. In 1994, a scheme was proposed for a spintronic NAND gate using three spins in a weak magnetic field.
• The ground state has neighboring spins anti-aligned due to exchange interaction, which is assumed stronger than the tendency to align with the magnetic field. The edge quantum dots serve as inputs and the middle dot as the output, realizing the NAND truth table.
• A problem was identified where the spintronic NAND gate gets stuck in indeterminate states and cannot ensure unidirectional signal propagation due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interactions. Holding the input fixed or increasing spacing between dots were not satisfactory solutions.
• In 1996, a clocked solution was proposed, inspired by charge-coupled device arrays, where barriers between dots are raised and lowered to control exchange interactions. However, a multi-phase clock is needed with gates between each dot, presenting fabrication challenges and negating the low-power advantage.
• Irreversible spintronic logic gates would dissipate at least 3 kW/cm2 at high integration densities, posing heat sinking challenges. Reversible logic gates, not constrained by the Landauer limit, were proposed as a solution.
• Qubits encoded in coherent spin states could implement reversible quantum gates. Experimental demonstration of coherent spin transfer between quantum dots has opened up possibilities in this area.
• Spin is preferred over charge for qubits in solids due to much longer coherence times. All-optical spin-based quantum computing has emerged as an alternative to electronic schemes.
• Optical read-out of spin qubits is more practical than electrical read-out, as it avoids the challenge of making contacts to individual quantum dots. Recent experiments have",1,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point. The main features of the CV orbital period distribution are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period gap and a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and shape of the distribution near this cut-off.

• The authors investigate ways to increase the minimum period by increasing the mass transfer rate, such as through consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where angular momentum is lost as a consequence of mass transfer. They also explore ways to hide the theoretically predicted accumulation of systems near the minimum period (the period spike) by introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population. Detailed calculations of the long-term CV evolution are presented.

• The authors find that even maximally efficient CAML cannot sufficiently increase the minimum period to match observations. Donor stars that are ""bloated"" due to tidal deformation would require an implausibly large deformation factor of 1.18 to obtain the observed minimum period of 77 minutes. Identifying the observed minimum period as an age limit rather than a period bounce would limit the donor mass in hydrogen-rich, unevolved CVs to around 0.03 solar masses.

• The authors compare various synthesized model CV populations to the observed period distribution using a modified chi-squared test. None of the model populations fit as well as a distribution that is simply flat in orbital period. Only models where brighter systems are weighted more heavily than in a simple magnitude-limited sample achieve similar goodness-of-fit values.

• Models designed to wash out the period spike by introducing a large spread in CAML efficiency generally perform better than models based on donor stars with a large spread of intrinsic deformation factors. Taking into account the full white dwarf mass spectrum improves the fit for all models by introducing an additional spread in the minimum period.

(2006) represents only a small fraction of the group-wide warm H2 emission, with a lower limit luminosity of 1.1x1042 erg s-1 spread over ~50 kpc2. There is evidence for another shock-excited feature called the ""H2 bridge"" between the main shock and NGC 7319, likely a remnant of past tidal interactions. The spatial variation in the H2 line ratios implies differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked system. This will be explored fully in Paper II.

* The global L(H2)/LX-ray ratio is >3 in the main shock and >2.5 in the ""bridge"" feature, confirming that H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-rays over the shock structures. This modifies the traditional view that X-rays dominate cooling in the later stages of compact group evolution. Since H2 forms on dust grains, dust emission is expected in these regions, but the low intensity radiation field produces only weak emission at 24 μm.

* Infrared ionic lines are interpreted as fast (100-300 km s-1) ionizing shocks, based on earlier optical nebular line ratios.

* The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was alive during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, the Ca-, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in primitive chondritic meteorites. At least some of the solar system's SLRIs may have been injected into either the presolar cloud or the solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave. Injection occurred as a single event that was spatially heterogeneous, potentially reducing the usefulness of @xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer. Previous models have shown how such initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk.

* The stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation. The leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula. CO self-shielding on the irregular outer surface of the disk would lead to initial spatial heterogeneity, though the process would be continuous in time. The existence of refractory particles in comet 81P/Wild 2, which are thought to have formed close to the protosun, implies large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the outer regions.

• The current cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant (ΛCDM) is favored by observations, but has theoretical issues like the cosmological constant problem and coincidence problem. Cosmological models with interacting dark matter and dark energy have been proposed to address these issues. This review summarizes the theoretical developments in this field and the observational evidence that could lead to detecting dark sector interactions.

• Interactions between dark matter and dark energy affect the expansion history, growth of density perturbations, CMB anisotropies, and late-time gravitational potentials. Observables like supernovae, BAO, gravitational lensing, redshift-space distortions, and cosmic structure growth can be used to constrain the interactions. Recent BOSS data measuring BAO at z=2.34 shows a 2.5σ deviation from ΛCDM that could be explained by interacting dark energy models.

• Interacting dark energy models with positive coupling can alleviate the coincidence problem by having attractor solutions where the dark matter to dark energy ratio depends only on the coupling constant, not initial conditions. Current and future observations from ground and space-based facilities across the electromagnetic spectrum will further test and constrain dark sector interactions. Combining complementary data sets will help control for systematics.

• Ongoing and planned ground-based dark energy experiments include galaxy redshift surveys, SN searches, weak lensing imaging surveys, and CMB experiments. Dedicated space missions like Euclid, WFIRST, CORE, and PRISM will provide high-precision measurements of expansion history, structure growth, CMB polarization and SZ clusters. Cross-correlating multi-wavelength data from e.g. Euclid, WFIRST and SKA will be particularly powerful for testing signatures of modified gravity.

* The nuclear multifragmentation process is being studied theoretically and experimentally to search for signs of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve by the ALADIN group in 1995 identified a wide plateau around 5 MeV temperature, which was associated with a possible phase transition. However, subsequent experiments by EOS and INDRA obtained slightly different caloric curves, with the plateau-like region absent in most cases.

* Factors contributing to the discrepancies include the precision of experimental measurements and finite-size effects of the caloric curve manifested through the dependency of the equilibrated sources on the reaction type. Recent reevaluations by the ALADIN group brought corrections to the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons and showed that the energies of spectator parts grow with increasing bombarding energy. The universality of a certain quantity subject to bombarding energy variation suggests that the equilibrated sources sequence should be the same for the reactions studied.

* Accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and sequential secondary particle emission are necessary to distinguish between equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies. These approaches should strictly obey the microcanonical constraints of the physical system in nuclear multifragmentation. The widely used statistical multifragmentation models (SMM and MMMC) do not strictly satisfy the microcanonical rules.

* The present paper describes refinements and improvements to the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model and its application to interpret recent experimental data from the ALADIN group. The improvements include using experimental discrete energy levels for light fragments, modifying the level density formula for heavier fragments, and including a secondary decay stage via Weisskopf evaporation theory or secondary break-up depending on the fragment's excitation.

• Threshold nets are obtained by assigning weights to nodes and connecting nodes whose combined weights exceed a threshold. They encompass a wide variety of architectures, from star graphs to complete graphs.
• Threshold nets can be encoded by a two-letter sequence, with nodes of type a connecting to none of the existing nodes and nodes of type b connecting to all previous nodes. Given a threshold net's sequence, fast algorithms can compute its structural properties and design nets with desired attributes.
• Despite their malleability, threshold nets are limited in some ways, such as having a diameter of only 1 or 2. Studying nets constructed from sequences with more letters allows for increased diameter while retaining analytical appeal and compressibility.
• Sequence nets admit a natural alphabetical ordering, which can be used to explore their structural properties. Symmetry arguments show that threshold nets are only one of three equivalence classes of two-letter sequence nets.
• The other two classes of two-letter sequence nets are related to a generalized form of threshold nets where the difference of weights is compared to a threshold. They have easily computable structural properties and exhibit modularity.
• With a three-letter alphabet, there are initially 512 possible rules, which can be reduced to 30 distinct equivalence classes using symmetry arguments. Some of these classes are natural extensions or degenerate forms of two-letter sequence nets.
• Three-letter sequence nets retain many desirable properties of two-letter nets, and some can be mapped to threshold nets with two thresholds. Structural properties such as degree distribution, clustering, distance, and betweenness centrality can be analyzed.
• The second smallest and largest eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian are important for dynamics and synchronization. Bounds and approximations for these eigenvalues can be derived using various structural properties of the nets.
• Two-letter sequence nets can be mapped to ""difference-threshold"" nets, where nodes are connected if the difference of their weights satisfies a threshold condition. This mapping may be helpful in analyzing certain properties of sequence nets.
• Open questions remain, such as further reducing the class of 3-letter nets using additional symmetries, systematically determining which sequences lead to connected nets, and studying nets with connectivity rules applied to a limited number of preceding",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 20, 'symbol': '•'}"

For d-wave superconductors, a nonanalyticity in the current-velocity relation at T=0 is introduced by nodes in the order parameter. Anisotropy in the nonlinear current as a function of superfluid velocity direction relative to the nodes is predicted. Experimental verification of a quadratic upturn in the magnetic response of the penetration depth at low T confirms d-wave gap nodes.

They study dimensionality, impurities, and strong electron-phonon coupling effects in the one-band case. For two-band superconductors, they look for signatures of the smaller gap, effects of band integration, and response to inter- and intraband impurities. Detailed predictions are made for the nonlinear coefficient of MgB2 using a complete microscopic theory with band structure parameters.

* The standard model (SM) of elementary particles has been very successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale, and the discovery of the Higgs boson by ATLAS and CMS at the LHC has strengthened its correctness. However, several groups have reported an anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2), which shows a discrepancy between SM predictions and measured values. Although it is too early to conclude this anomaly is evidence of new physics, it hints at the possibility of new particles and interactions related to the muon sector.

* Following the historical importance of gauge interactions in constructing fundamental physics models, this paper explores the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The authors consider a model where the lepton number is gauged and calculate conditions to avoid washout of baryon asymmetry. They find that the interaction rate involving the new Yukawa coupling must be smaller than the Hubble scale, or the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos must be small.

• The origin of celestial gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is one of the most important unexplained astrophysical phenomena. GRBs are powerful flashes of gamma-rays lasting from less than a second to tens of seconds, with an isotropic distribution in the sky.

• Long GRBs (>2s) have been found to be at cosmological distances with redshifts up to 4.5. The most likely explanations involve huge energy releases from the collapse of a massive star (hypernova) or the coalescence of a compact binary system, both of which are expected to emit gravitational waves (GWs).

• The authors launched a program to study correlations between GRB events detected by BeppoSAX and output signals from the gravitational wave antennas NAUTILUS and EXPLORER. They use a cross-correlation algorithm to deal with the unknown time difference between GRB and GW bursts and unmodelled noise.

• The characteristics of the NAUTILUS and EXPLORER detectors are provided. The authors present an experimental method and model for the averaged correlation at zero delay time.

• Using Bayesian inference, the authors calculate the probability density function of the GW amplitude consistent with the observed average squared energy. They use a uniform prior distribution for the GW amplitude, bounded to non-negative values.

• The paper studies the citation distribution of scientific publications, which is believed to be a power-law form. The power-law behavior is a result of highly cited papers being more likely to acquire further citations through a preferential attachment process.
• The authors propose a model that considers two research areas and referencing within and across each other. The model is also applicable to the web of human sexual contacts, where interactions between males and females can be thought of as two coupled growing networks.
• The model is built by introducing new nodes with no incoming links to each network at each time step, with a fraction of their outgoing links attaching to pre-existing nodes in their own network and the remaining fraction to nodes in the other network. The attachments are preferential and depend on the number of connections and initial attractiveness of the pre-existing nodes.
• The authors analyze the time evolution of the networks using rate equations and derive the total in-degree distribution, intra-link distribution, and cross-link distribution for each network. The distributions are found to have power-law forms with exponents depending on the average total in-degree, initial attractiveness of nodes, and coupling parameters.
• In the weak coupling case, the power-law exponent of the intra-link distribution is equal to the total link distribution, recovering the empirical findings in previous studies. Varying the coupling parameter yields exponent values between 2 and 3.
• For citation networks, the authors find that the intra-link distribution exponent coincides with the distribution of connectivities for the electric power grid of southern California. For the web of human sexual contacts, setting appropriate parameters reproduces the observed power-law exponents for male and female degree distributions.

The method generalizes previous work and is simple to implement using standard semidefinite programming software without requiring globalization strategies like line search.

They provide two ways to form overestimates for bilinear matrix-valued mappings and show applications to static output feedback controller design problems. These problems have at least one bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraint which can be approximated using a positive semidefinite convex overestimate.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors note the method can potentially be extended to more general nonconvex semidefinite programs where an inner convex approximation of the feasible set can be found.

• The paper investigates collaborative relay beamforming under secrecy constraints in cognitive radio networks. The secrecy rate of the amplify-and-forward (AF) cognitive relay channel is characterized. The beamforming optimization is formulated as a quasiconvex optimization problem which can be solved through convex semidefinite programming (SDP).

• Two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes are proposed to reduce the computational complexity. In the first scheme, the beamforming vector is chosen to lie in the null space of the eavesdropper's channel to eliminate their eavesdropping capability. In the second scheme, the beamforming vector lies in the null space of both the eavesdropper's and primary user's channels.

• The optimal secrecy rates for the AF collaborative relay beamforming system are plotted under both individual and total power constraints. The suboptimal null space beamforming achievable rates are shown to be very close to the optimal ones, especially at high SNRs. Imposing individual relay power constraints leads to small losses in the secrecy rates compared to total power constraints.

• The optimal and suboptimal secrecy rates are also plotted as a function of the interference temperature limit. Beamforming in the null space of both the eavesdropper's and primary user's channels is insensitive to the interference limit. Beamforming only in the null space of the eavesdropper's channel achieves near-optimal performance regardless of the interference limit.

Numerical results illustrate the performance of the different beamforming schemes. The proposed schemes can be extended to multiple primary users and eavesdroppers under certain conditions.

• The parallel chip-firing game is a periodic automaton on graphs where vertices ""fire"" chips to their neighbors. A position is defined by the graph and number of chips on each vertex. At each step, a vertex fires one chip to each neighbor if it has at least as many chips as neighbors.
• The game has a finite number of positions and eventually reaches a repeating state. The minimal number of steps for the game to repeat is called the period, and the number of initial steps before the period begins is the transient length. The parallel chip-firing game has connections to various fields including computer science, physics, and cellular automata.
• For games with nontrivial period on a connected graph, the number of chips on each vertex is bounded. The complement of a confined position, obtained by replacing the chips on each vertex with the number needed to not fire, has equivalent behavior. A position repeats if and only if each vertex has fired the same number of times within those steps.
• On a complete bipartite graph, the only possible periods are 1, 2, or a multiple of the number of vertices on the smaller side. If the two sides have fired a multiple of the number of vertices on the other side, the period divides that multiple. Conversely, positions can be constructed with period equal to any factor of the number of vertices on the smaller side, or twice that.
• On a complete k-partite graph, positions can be constructed with period length n for any n from 2 to the product of the sizes of the k-1 smallest partite sets. The period appears related to the orders of subcycles in the graph. Reducing a game by removing excess chips while preserving the firing pattern may make it more approachable.

* This paper discusses recent progress in understanding strongly correlated electronic systems using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) combined with local density approximation (LDA) based electronic structure calculations. Merging these techniques is promising for exploring the parameter space of realistic solid state systems where the interaction strength is not known beforehand. The ideology differs from model Hamiltonians where input parameters define the correlation regime.

* Realistic DMFT simulations require solving the general multiorbital Anderson impurity model (AIM) to scan the parameter space and determine the interaction for a given doping, degeneracy and bandwidth. Existing approaches based on non-crossing approximation (NCA), iterative perturbation theory (IPT), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) have limitations in the number of regimes or orbitals they can handle. The paper proposes an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital case.

* The interpolation is not an alternative impurity solver, but follows the ideology of LDA where approximations were designed by analytical fits to QMC simulations of the homogeneous electron gas. QMC calculations for the impurity model show smooth self-energies at imaginary frequencies for a range of interactions and dopings, making it tempting to design an interpolation. High precision in reproducing self-energies may not be required for applications like total energy calculations.

* The interpolative algorithm uses a rational representation for the self-energy, with coefficients determined by forcing it to obey several limits and constraints. These include the infinite frequency limit, positions of Hubbard bands, low-frequency mass renormalization, mean particle number, and the self-energy value at zero frequency. The slave-boson mean-field (SBMF) approach and Hubbard I approximation are explored to determine the functional dependence of the coefficients.

• The study of harmonic maps was initiated by Fuller, Nash, and Sampson, with the first general existence result due to Eells and Sampson. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional on the space of smooth maps between Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The trace of the second fundamental form of harmonic maps vanishes.

• The energy of a smooth map φ between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds M and N is defined using the energy density e(φ), which depends on the differential dφ and the metrics. The second fundamental form β(φ) measures the difference between the pullback connection ∇φ and the Levi-Civita connections on M and N. A map is harmonic if its tension field τ(φ), the trace of β(φ), vanishes identically.

• The index of a harmonic map is the dimension of the largest subspace on which the Hessian is negative definite. A harmonic map is stable if its index is zero and unstable otherwise. A map is horizontally conformal if it is either critical or conformal when restricted to the horizontal space.

* This paper presents Herschel/SPIRE far-infrared (FIR) maps at 250, 350, and 500 μm for 313 AGN selected from the Swift/BAT 58-month catalog. Combined with PACS photometry from a previous study, the SPIRE flux densities form complete FIR SEDs for a large, nearby, relatively unbiased sample of AGN. The flux densities were measured using timeline fitting for point sources and aperture photometry for extended and undetected sources.

* Statistical analysis shows Seyfert 2s are detected at a higher rate and have slightly higher SPIRE luminosities than Seyfert 1s, but the effect is small, indicating AGN FIR properties are independent of orientation on average. The Herschel luminosities are correlated with each other, suggesting connected emission processes from 70-500 μm, but are not well-correlated with the 14-195 keV AGN luminosity, implying the AGN is not strongly affecting the FIR emission in most cases.

* The SPIRE colors of the BAT AGN are statistically similar to those of high stellar mass normal star-forming galaxies, emphasizing the FIR emission of AGN hosts is likely produced by cold dust heated by stellar radiation. However, 6 radio-loud AGN have anomalous colors indicating synchrotron-dominated FIR SEDs, and another group of AGN have a 500 μm excess possibly related to coronal emission above the accretion disk.

* Future work will combine the Herschel photometry with archival data to perform detailed SED modeling investigating the local starburst-AGN connection and AGN contribution to the FIR. The Herschel spacecraft and SPIRE instrument were developed through international collaboration, and this research made use of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database and data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.

• The fundamental group of the complement of plane curves is an important topological invariant that can be computed for line arrangements. It has applications in distinguishing between connected components of moduli spaces of smooth projective surfaces, computing fundamental groups of hypersurface complements, and finding more examples of Zariski pairs. The goal is to explore which line arrangements have fundamental groups with conjugation-free geometric presentations.

• For a line arrangement, one can define an associated graph of multiple points. Fan proved that if this graph has no cycles, the fundamental group can be written as a direct sum of free and infinite cyclic groups. A conjugation-free geometric presentation has generators corresponding to meridians of the lines and relations without conjugations.

• The paper aims to characterize line arrangements whose fundamental groups have conjugation-free geometric presentations. It is shown that the fundamental group of the Ceva arrangement does not have such a presentation. The main result is that real arrangements whose graph is a disjoint union of cycles, with no line having more than two multiple points, do have conjugation-free geometric presentations.

• For a real arrangement of n lines whose graph is a triangle with all multiple points of multiplicity 3, the fundamental group is a semi-direct product of free groups. It is an open question whether the family of arrangements with conjugation-free geometric presentations is broader than the family of simple arrangements. Some initial computations suggest the presentations may be complemented but not complete.

• The paper uses the Moishezon-Teicher method and van Kampen's theorem to compute fundamental groups of real line arrangement complements. Wiring diagrams and Lefschetz pairs are used to encode the combinatorial data. Skeletons are computed from the Lefschetz pairs, and relations in the fundamental group are derived from the skeletons.

• The paper proves that real arrangements whose graphs are unique cycles of any length, with no line having more than two multiple points, have conjugation-free geometric presentations. This is generalized to arrangements whose graphs are disjoint unions of cycles using a decomposition theorem of Oka and Sakamoto. The authors thank several people for discussions and corrections.

• The text discusses various models and studies related to flavor symmetry and generating mass and mixing patterns of fermions. Continuous symmetries like U(1), SO(3) and discrete symmetries like S3 exchange symmetry have had some success in describing mass and mixing patterns in the leptonic sector. To avoid mass degeneracy of νμ and ντ under S3 symmetry, the A4 symmetry was first introduced by E. Ma and G. Rajasekaran.

• After the introduction of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern (θ12 ≈ 35°, θ23 = 45°, θ13 = 0°), many works tried to fit this pattern through the A4 symmetry. In a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model with A4 discrete symmetry, the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern arises naturally in the work of Altarelli and Feruglio. The model also admits hierarchical masses of the three charged leptons whereas the neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate or hierarchical.

• Although the model gives rise to θ13 ≈ 0 (θ13 < 10°) consistent with experimental bounds, a non-zero and complex value of θ13 leads to the possibility of exploring CP violation in the leptonic sector, which is the goal of many future experiments. Within the A4 model framework, non-zero θ13 is generated either through radiative corrections or higher dimensional mass terms. The generation of non-zero complex θ13 and CP violation has been extensively studied for the Altarelli-Feruglio model with explicit soft breaking of A4 symmetry.

• In the present work, the authors investigate generating non-zero θ13 through the see-saw mechanism by considering a small perturbation in mD, the Dirac neutrino mass matrix, while keeping the same texture of the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix MR as proposed in an earlier reference. They first study in detail the perturbation of mD by adding a small parameter at different entries and observe the variations of the three mixing angles in terms of other model",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30, 'symbol': '•'}"

• Organic molecular crystals composed of organic molecules held together by weak van der Waals forces are emerging as excellent candidates for fabricating nanoscale devices with potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, solar energy harvesting, surface photochemistry, organic electronics and spintronics. These devices are composed of both an organic and inorganic component, with the organic component forming the active part and the inorganic component providing electrical contact to external circuitry. The electronic structure of the interface between these two parts plays a crucial role in determining device performance. In particular, it is important to determine how charge transfers between the organic and inorganic components and at what energies the transfer takes place.

• Calculating the addition and removal energies of a molecule adsorbed on a substrate is challenging, especially in the single-molecule limit. Upon adsorption, the electron addition and removal energies change from their gas phase values due to polarization of the substrate. The image charge accumulated on the substrate near the molecule alters the addition or removal energy. A common way to calculate these energies is to use a quasiparticle description, ignoring relaxation effects and aligning the metal Fermi level with the LUMO and HOMO of the molecule.

• The adequacy of the quasiparticle description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the HOMO and LUMO energies. If using density functional theory, it is important to note that in general the Kohn-Sham orbitals cannot be rigorously interpreted as quasiparticle energies, except for the HOMO which equals the negative of the ionization potential. Local and semi-local DFT functionals like LDA and GGA perform poorly for molecules, even for the HOMO level. Hybrid functionals, self-interaction corrections, and range-separated functionals can improve the situation.

• Calculating energy level alignment of a molecule near a metal presents additional challenges. The image charge effect is completely non-local in nature, so functionals must be explicitly non-local to capture it. LDA and GGA fail to properly describe the change in HOMO and LUMO positions as a molecule approaches a metal surface.

* The authors studied critical Casimir forces (CCFs) between two spherical colloids immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture near a planar substrate using mean-field theory. They calculated the normal and lateral forces on one colloid for various boundary conditions (BCs) and geometrical configurations. The forces are characterized by universal scaling functions that depend on the ratio of the surface-to-surface distances to the bulk correlation length. The presence of the substrate lifts the degeneracy between ++ and -- BCs for two colloids and can change the sign of the lateral force between +- BCs from repulsive to attractive.

* The authors determined the many-body contributions to the CCFs by subtracting the pairwise colloid-colloid and colloid-substrate forces from the total force. The many-body contribution to the normal force can change sign at a fixed temperature by varying the lateral position of one colloid. The many-body effects are large when the colloids are close to each other and the substrate, and near the critical point. Comparisons to results for quantum electrodynamic Casimir forces between dielectric spheres and for van der Waals forces between atoms near a surface were made.

* For two colloids of the same size vertically aligned with the substrate at a fixed separation, the authors varied the colloid-substrate distance for various BCs. The many-body contribution to the normal force on the lower colloid points towards (away from) the substrate if the colloids have the same (opposite) BCs. The many-body effects contribute 10-15% to the total force in this configuration. The authors acknowledged computational support and a provided reference.

* Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and plays a key role in the interstellar medium. Dust grains are recognized as the favored location for H2 formation due to inefficient gas phase routes.

* The sticking of H atoms onto dust grain surfaces governs the formation of H2 and other molecules containing H atoms. Experiments have studied H atom sticking in both the physisorbed and chemisorbed states on various surfaces like amorphous carbon, silicates, and graphite.

* A large portion of the surface area available for chemistry in the ISM is in the form of small grains or PAHs, which have characteristics similar to graphite surfaces. H2 formation can occur on PAHs by involving a pre-adsorbed H atom in monomer or para-dimer configuration, but the inefficient sticking of H atoms in monomers is an obstacle.

* The atom or atoms in an atomic clock are passive and do not ""tick"", so the clock needs an active oscillator in addition to the atom(s). Two problems are encountered in designing an atomic clock to realize the SI second: the atomic resonance varies with the clock's construction and operation, and the oscillator drifts in relation to its control setting. These problems are dealt with by introducing a parametrized wave function and using computer-mediated feedback to steer the oscillator.

* The wave function incorporated into an atomic clock's operation can never be unconditionally known. Quantum theory reflects a distinction between 'explanation' (wave functions and operators) and 'evidence' (probabilities of outcomes). Choosing a wave function to explain evidence requires reaching beyond logic based on that evidence, and future evidence can call for revising the chosen wave function.

* Clocks generating UTC are steered toward aiming points that depend on a chosen wave function and an hypothesized metric tensor field, both of which are constrained but not determined by measured data. The computational machinery that steers clocks involves writing and reading records, with a separation between the phases to avoid a logical short circuit. An open machine, based on a modified Turing machine, is used to model the computations and phased communication between clocks.

* Logical synchronization, based on the principle that a symbol must arrive during the writing phase of the receiving machine's cycle, is necessary for channels connecting clock readings at transmission and reception of symbols.

* MOPED (Multiple Optimised Parameter Estimation and Data compression) is a patented algorithm for compressing data and speeding up likelihood function evaluation in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model parameters and must be calculated and inverted at each likelihood evaluation. However, MOPED has limitations and only guarantees maintaining the likelihood's Fisher matrix at a chosen point, so it can have problems with multimodal and some degenerate distributions.

* The authors demonstrate cases where MOPED fails to accurately represent the true likelihood function for certain astrophysical scenarios. They expand these scenarios to cases where MOPED does work and discuss criteria for when MOPED is likely to accurately represent the likelihood. They also discuss a solution of using multiple fiducial models, as presented in another paper.

* For an n-dimensional model, any point where the n hyper-surfaces of compressed MOPED values equal to the values at maximum likelihood will yield parameter values with likelihood equal to the true peak. While one intersection is expected near the true solution, other peaks can exist. Mapping the MOPED likelihood surface can determine if there are multiple intersections, in which case the original likelihood must be checked.

* The MOPED algorithm can provide significant computational speedups for likelihood functions, but it is important to verify it accurately portrays the likelihood before using its results. Some solutions to the problem of erroneous likelihood peaks have been presented and tested. The authors conclude that while MOPED can be extremely useful in some cases, it is not always reliable for parameter estimation.

* The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a major puzzle in particle physics, with the observed vacuum energy density being much smaller than theoretical predictions. Various sources of vacuum energy density exist, such as zero point energies of particles and potential energies from symmetry breaking.
* The vacuum energy density can receive large radiative corrections and its experimental value is estimated to be very small, leading to the mystery of dark energy. To address the CCP, the authors suggest that the classical gravitational fields may not couple effectively to a large portion of the vacuum energy, despite the coupling between gravitons and matter at the microscopic level.
* Under certain assumptions, the authors conjecture that gravitational corrections to the vacuum energy at the TeV scale could be a candidate for dark energy. If some scalar field dominates the vacuum energy, it could be a candidate for dark matter, and if superpartners appear at the TeV scale, their zero point energies could contribute to the vacuum energy.

* The rotation curves (RCs) of dwarf galaxies can be used to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM). The Orion dwarf galaxy is a good candidate for this as its kinematics are dominated by DM down to small galactocentric radii. Recent studies show that kinematic data of dwarf galaxies are better fit by a cored DM halo than by a cuspy profile predicted by ΛCDM simulations. The Orion dwarf provides an important test of this paradigm.

* MOND is an alternative to DM that modifies Newtonian gravity at low accelerations to account for the mass discrepancy in galaxies. MOND has been successful in reproducing RCs of many spiral galaxies using only luminous matter. To derive the DM profile or test MOND, the distribution of baryonic components and reliable gas kinematics are needed. The Orion dwarf has high-quality HI data, a large mass discrepancy at all radii, and well-modeled baryonic components, making it an excellent laboratory to test gravitational theories.

* The stellar mass of the Orion dwarf is estimated from near-IR photometry. The HI data show the galaxy has a gas disk with well-ordered rotation. A tilted-ring model fit to the velocity field yields the rotation curve, which differs negligibly from the circular velocity curve after correcting for asymmetric drift. A harmonic decomposition demonstrates the gas flow is dominated by circular motion.

* Mass modeling shows a cored DM halo fits the RC extremely well, while an NFW halo overestimates the velocities at r>2 kpc. The MOND model fails to match the RC unless the distance is increased by 1.9 times the current estimate. The Orion dwarf is representative of dwarfs with RCs that imply large amounts of DM in the central regions. Further observations to directly measure its distance would make it a decisive test for MOND.

Going beyond tree level to include quantum effects requires renormalization, and the problem of renormalizing time evolution equations in single field models was understood several years ago. The authors take an approach where the mass matrix is allowed to be non-diagonal and account for mixing by expanding each field in terms of all the in-state creation and annihilation operators.

* The authors consider a Lagrangian for n coupled scalar fields and set up a formalism for quantizing the system. They outline a renormalization procedure and provide a summary of results for the two-field case. The formalism is demonstrated with two examples: a simple reheating model and a hybrid inflation model motivated by supersymmetry.

* In the reheating model, the authors investigate the narrow resonance and broad resonance regimes. They find that in the narrow resonance regime, the mixing angle is small and plays a sub-dominant role, whereas in the broad resonance regime, the mixing effects are very important. Neglecting the mixing could lead to incomplete results.

* In the supersymmetric hybrid inflation model, the authors show that by taking into account fluctuations and investigating the full mixed system, the feature of efficient particle production during preheating can be lost in some regimes. This is because the effective mass corrections for the two fields are different in these regimes, leading to a chaotic trajectory for the renormalized field equations of motion, mimicking the situation of a nonsupersymmetric hybrid model. Supersymmetric hybrid models can lose some of their attractiveness compared to general hybrid models.

* The authors conclude by emphasizing that the departure from the straight line trajectory of the zero mode fields is an essential feature of a supersymmetric hybrid model if fluctuations are taken into account. Supersymmetric hybrid inflationary models have a unique behavior allowing a smaller inflationary scale compared to the effective masses of the fields around their global minima.

* The existence of dark matter has been established, and if it is an elementary particle, the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a promising candidate. The WIMP can be accommodated by introducing an inert scalar field, where the imposed Z2 parity ensures the stability of the dark matter candidate. Phenomenology of such models has been studied in various references.

* Neutrino oscillation measurements have confirmed that neutrinos have tiny masses compared to the electroweak scale, possibly indicating they are Majorana type. The seesaw mechanism, introducing right-handed neutrinos with large Majorana masses, is the simplest explanation for tiny neutrino masses. The Higgs triplet model (HTM) is another simple model for generating neutrino masses.

* In some models, tiny neutrino masses are generated at higher orders of perturbation and naturally contain a dark matter candidate. The Yukawa couplings of neutrinos with the SM Higgs boson are forbidden at tree level by a Z2 parity, which also guarantees the stability of the lightest Z2-odd particle as a dark matter candidate if it is electrically neutral. This paper considers an extension of the HTM with a Z2 parity where neutrino masses are generated at one-loop level and a dark matter candidate appears.

* In the HTM, Majorana masses for neutrinos are generated via the Yukawa interaction with a nonzero vacuum expectation value (vev) of an SU(2) triplet scalar field. The vev is described by the doublet vev and the typical mass scale of the triplet field; the dimensionful parameter breaks lepton number conservation at the trilinear term. The mass of the triplet field is assumed to be much larger than the electroweak scale as the simplest explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses.

* A characteristic feature of the HTM is that the structure of the neutrino mass matrix is given by that of the Yukawa matrix. Direct information on the mass matrix could be extracted from the decay of the doubly charged component of the triplet field if it is light enough to be produced at collider experiments.

• The introduction of quantum technologies like quantum key distribution (QKD) promises to fundamentally change communication, but requires new quantum-enabled infrastructure. Quantum components like memories, repeaters, and channels must operate in a strictly quantum way, and their imperfections can be dealt with through classical post-processing.
• To enforce a minimal quantum requirement, devices should not act as ""measure and prepare"" channels which destroy quantum correlations. The quantum throughput, which measures how well a channel preserves quantum correlations, can be used to characterize the suitability of devices for quantum communication tasks.
• The authors propose a scheme to quantify the quantum throughput of optical devices in a practical way, using a finite number of test states and measurements. They extend previous qualitative results to provide a quantitative picture of optical devices.
• The scheme is based on sending part of an entangled state through the channel and determining the remaining entanglement, which can be done in a ""prepare and measure"" scenario. The remaining entanglement in the infinite-dimensional output states is estimated by projecting onto the most significant two-dimensional subspace.
• Homodyne measurements are used to estimate the subspace parameters, and the entanglement of the projected state is calculated to bound the entanglement of the full state using the strong monotonicity property of entanglement measures. The minimal entanglement compatible with the estimated parameters and known constraints is determined.
• The authors apply their quantification scheme to optical channels characterized by loss and excess noise, using the negativity entanglement measure. The calculated entanglement bounds are tight in the limit of zero loss and noise, but become lower and more trivial for higher noise values.
• The quantification scheme provides a useful method for characterizing the quantum nature of optical devices, particularly in the low noise regime. Possible extensions include projecting onto higher-dimensional subspaces or developing alternative approaches to overcome the weakening of the bounds with increasing noise.

* The study of dipole moments of elementary particles over the past 83 years has provided valuable insights into subatomic physics. The pioneering work of Stern and the discovery of large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron laid the groundwork for the development of QED and QCD.
* The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is given by μ = g(Qe/2m)S, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio and a = (g-2)/2 is the anomaly. For point particles, the anomaly arises from radiative corrections, with the lowest-order correction giving the famous Schwinger result of α/2π.
* The magnetic and electric dipole moments can be represented as the real and imaginary parts of a generalized dipole operator. The electron anomaly is now measured to a relative precision of about 4 parts per billion, while the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million and is sensitive to physics at the 1 TeV scale.
* The standard model value of the muon anomaly has contributions from QED loops, hadronic loops, and weak loops. A significant difference between the experimental and theoretical values would signify the presence of new physics such as lepton substructure, anomalous W couplings, or supersymmetry.
* The hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly cannot be calculated directly from QCD and is instead determined using a dispersion relation and experimental data on e+e- annihilation to hadrons. Recent analyses suggest that only the e+e- data should be used to determine this contribution due to inconsistencies with tau decay data.

• The paper examines an optomechanical system consisting of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling. The origin of the reactive coupling lies in the mechanical motion dependence of the extrinsic losses of the disk resonator and phase-dependent gradient forces.

• The authors investigate the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump probe fields and report reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting, in contrast to previous works that only used dispersive coupling. The physical system is introduced and the time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators are given and solved.

• The expectation value of the output fields is calculated, and the nonlinear susceptibilities for Stokes and anti-Stokes processes are obtained. The authors find that there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in the absence of reactive coupling, but normal mode splitting occurs in the presence of reactive coupling.

• Numerical simulations show that reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity can result in normal mode splitting of the output fields, with the peak separation increasing with pump power. The reactive coupling can also cause four-wave mixing, creating an anti-Stokes component generated by the optomechanical system.

• In conclusion, the authors have observed normal mode splitting of output fields due to reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity, with the separation of peaks increasing for larger pump powers. The reactive coupling can also lead to the generation of an anti-Stokes field by the optomechanical system.

The most widely accepted theory is the KTHNY picture, which describes two separate continuous transitions mediated by the unbinding of dislocation pairs and dislocations into point defects. However, the theory's assumption of a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects contradicts observations of dislocation alignment and accumulation.

The profiles are well-fit by King or EFF models in the inner regions but show excess light at large radii compared to the best-fit profiles.

Clusters with eSFE < 30% are completely unbound and those with eSFE < 40% lose a significant fraction of their stellar mass.

Casimir showed that two neutral metallic plates in vacuum should attract each other due to the zero-point energy of electromagnetic modes. E. M. Lifshitz and others generalized the theory to dielectrics, showing the force depends on the dielectric functions of the materials and medium between them. The authors extend this to calculate the torque between two birefringent dielectric plates with in-plane optical anisotropy.

* The Helmholtz free energy of the electromagnetic field between the plates depends on their dielectric properties and separation distance. The torque between the plates is found by taking the angular derivative of the free energy. In the non-retarded limit for slightly birefringent materials, the torque is inversely proportional to the separation squared and varies sinusoidally with the angle between the optical axes.

* The authors numerically calculate the retarded torque between a 40 μm diameter quartz or calcite disk parallel to a barium titanate plate at sub-micron distances in vacuum. The torque varies sinusoidally with angle, with a maximum magnitude on the order of 10^-19 N·m at 100 nm separation, solely due to zero-point energy fluctuations. The sign of the torque depends on the relative orientation of the optical axes that minimizes the zero-point energy.

* This paper explores new techniques to compute correlation functions of single trace operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, both at weak and strong coupling. At weak coupling, the authors show how deforming the CFT by a marginal or irrelevant operator introduces new divergences that are determined by the couplings in 3-point functions. By diagonalizing the deformed anomalous dimension matrix using integrability techniques, one can systematically compute these couplings in perturbation theory.

* At strong coupling, the authors improve on the supergravity approximation by including two heavy string state insertions and studying 3-point functions with an additional chiral operator. They compute the string theory partition function using a saddle point approximation that describes the heavy string propagation, with the chiral operator acting as a tadpole that deforms the heavy string worldsheet. Agreement is found with renormalization group expectations for specific examples involving the Lagrangian operator.

* The authors consider various classical string solutions dual to single trace operators, including the point-like BMN string, circular rotating string, giant magnon, and spinning string with angular momenta in both AdS5 and S5. For each case, they compute the 2-point and 3-point functions with the Lagrangian operator at strong coupling, finding agreement with weak coupling results. The computations rely on a saddle point approximation and fixing the string modular parameter.

* The strong coupling computations of 3-point functions are based on representing the heavy string state by a first-quantized string path integral with appropriate boundary conditions. The chiral operator is included using Witten diagrams, with the supergravity field acting as a source on the heavy string worldsheet. This allows going beyond the supergravity approximation that is usually limited to chiral operators.

* For the point-like BMN string, the authors find that the 3-point function with the Lagrangian has the spacetime dependence required by conformal invariance. The coupling is determined at large angular momentum and agrees with the renormalization group expectation. Similar agreement is found for the circular rotating string and giant magnon solutions.

* The resonance spectra and length spectra of two flat circular dielectric microwave resonators were measured and compared to semiclassical trace formulas. The trace formulas were adapted to the 3D case using a 2D approximation with an effective index of refraction. Good agreement was found between the experimental length spectra and trace formulas, with the periodic orbit contributions successfully identified.
* Two effects caused shifts between the experimental length spectra peak positions and the periodic orbit lengths: the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction, and systematic inaccuracy of the 2D approximation. These effects were of similar magnitude but opposite sign, partially cancelling each other. Improving the accuracy of the trace formulas for 3D dielectric resonators remains an open problem.

Using Monte Carlo simulations, the authors estimate the cosmic coalescence rate, which lags behind the star formation rate due to the distribution of coalescence timescales. They find that a continuous background is formed by sources beyond a redshift of 0.23-0.35, while sources at lower redshifts produce a ""popcorn"" noise.

* The density parameter Omega_gw of the gravitational wave background is computed, peaking at around 630-670 Hz with an amplitude of 1.1-1.3 x 10^-9. The signal is below the sensitivity of first and second generation gravitational wave detectors. However, using the planned sensitivity of third generation interferometers like the Einstein Gravitational Wave Telescope (EGO), the authors find that a cross-correlation of two coincident EGO-like detectors could reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.7 after one year of integration.

* The ""popcorn"" noise contribution is found to be an order of magnitude higher than the continuous background, peaking at 1.2-1.3 kHz with an amplitude of 1.1-1.2 x 10^-8.

• This paper presents an analytical approach to study the nonlinear effects of particle acceleration and reacceleration at shock fronts. The backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock structure is taken into account. The presence of pre-existing seed particles that can be reaccelerated by the shock is also considered for the first time in a nonlinear framework.

• The equations for particle transport and gas dynamics are solved to determine the velocity, density and pressure profiles of the system including the gas, seed particles, and particles accelerated from the thermal pool. An integral-differential equation is derived for the quantity U_p, the average fluid velocity experienced by particles with momentum p while diffusing in the upstream region. The compression factors at the gas subshock and total shock are related through this equation.

• The appearance of multiple solutions for the shock compression ratio is investigated, as a function of parameters like the maximum particle momentum, shock Mach number, and injection efficiency. Three regimes are identified: weakly modified shocks with a unique solution, strongly modified shocks with multiple solutions, and highly modified shocks with a unique solution again. The spectra of accelerated particles are calculated in each case.

• The critical behavior and multiple solutions appear both for acceleration of particles from the thermal pool and for reacceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays. For certain parameters, the shock modification is dominated by the reaccelerated seed particles rather than the freshly injected ones. This may have implications for the spectra of secondary nuclei produced by spallation.

It is shown that even small injection efficiencies can lead to a modified shock due to the presence of the seed particles. The nonlinear reacceleration can enhance the energy of the seeds by about an order of magnitude at each shock passage.

• The continuous increase of cosmic ray energy through repeated reacceleration inevitably leads to the shock becoming modified by the nonthermal pressure.

* Cosmological observations from type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure provide evidence that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase. This acceleration is generally attributed to the existence of dark energy, an exotic energy source with negative pressure.

• The sound horizon depends primarily on the baryon-to-photon ratio and redshift of equality, both of which are well-constrained by the CMB.

Scale-free networks, which are common in the real world, show a power-law degree distribution and can influence the speed of epidemic propagation.

* The authors studied the impact of different structural properties on the dynamics of epidemics in scale-free networks using SI and SIS epidemic models. They generated networks with the same degree distribution but different topologies using various algorithms. The networks generated by the Barabási-Albert (BA) method were found to be more centralized and efficient compared to others.

* Simulations were carried out to investigate disease prevalence levels and the speed at which these levels would be reached in the different networks. The spread of acute and chronic infectious diseases was simulated by varying parameters such as the probability of disease spread and the duration of infection. The simulations were performed using MATLAB, and the average prevalence was calculated for each network model.

* In undirected networks, disease prevalence was found to be independent of the probability of disease spread, and an increase in this probability led to higher prevalence levels. Increasing the number of edges per vertex also resulted in higher prevalence. Among the undirected networks, those generated using the MB algorithm showed the lowest prevalence levels.

* In directed networks, similar trends were observed for acute diseases, with disease prevalence being independent of the probability of spread and increasing with higher probabilities. Increasing the number of edges per vertex also led to higher prevalence. Among the directed networks, those generated using the BA algorithm exhibited the lowest prevalence levels.

A two-component (soft+hard) model accurately describes the single-particle densities. The results reveal the distribution of minimum-bias jet fragments and a significant nonjet quadrupole component at higher multiplicities. The dijet production trend is inconsistent with the eikonal approximation and the quadrupole trend is inconsistent with initial-state eccentricity.

• The combined trends suggest centrality is not a useful concept for proton-proton collisions, with fluctuations possibly depending on the depth of wave function penetration. The 2D angular correlations conflict with assumptions about the underlying event, with minimum-bias dijets contributing strongly to the transverse region. The region with minimal jet contribution is near the azimuth origin, excluding the same-side 2D jet peak and most of the away-side 1D peak.

• The nonjet quadrupole component has implications: initial-state geometry is not useful for proton-proton collisions, its presence in a small low-density system contradicts hydrodynamic interpretations, and the same-side ""ridge"" at the LHC results from an interplay of the away-side jet peak and nonjet quadrupole. In a hydro narrative, the quadrupole should modify single-particle pT spectra, which is not observed.

Arguments against the model, such as the failure of the HIJING Monte Carlo, are questioned.

• According to the standard cosmological model, ordinary matter makes up only 4% of the total mass-energy of the universe, while 23% is in the form of unknown non-baryonic dark matter and 73% is a mysterious dark energy. Dark matter is needed to explain the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters and the mass of visible matter. Numerical simulations confirm that cold dark matter (CDM) plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures.

• CDM has some problems at galactic scales, such as predicting a central density peak and an abundance of satellite galaxies around large galaxies that are not observed. The most important challenge is accounting for Milgrom's law, which states that dark matter only intervenes in regions where the gravitational field is weaker than a certain critical acceleration a0. The MOND formula, which modifies Newton's law in the weak field regime, impressively succeeds in obtaining the rotation curves of many galaxies.

• Faced with the success of MOND, there are three possible solutions: 1) MOND could be explained within the CDM framework, 2) we are witnessing a modification of the law of gravity in the weak field regime, which is the traditional MOND approach and its relativistic extensions, or 3) gravity is not modified but dark matter has particular characteristics making it suitable to explain the MOND phenomenology, which is a new approach that also lends itself well to cosmology. Most astrophysicists favor the first solution, but no convincing mechanism has been found to naturally incorporate the acceleration constant a0 into CDM halos.

This requires modifying general relativity to recover MOND in the non-relativistic limit, leading to tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) theories. However, TeVeS has problems in galaxy clusters and in reproducing observed CMB fluctuations.

* This paper studies closed graphs, where a labeling of a graph is closed if distinct edges ij and ik with i<j,k imply jk is an edge. A graph is closed if it has a closed labeling.
* Closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals, where the generators form a Gröbner basis if and only if the graph labeling is closed. The goal is to characterize when a graph has a closed labeling in terms of graph properties.
* Every closed graph is chordal, claw-free, and narrow (meaning every vertex is distance at most one from every longest shortest path). The converse is proved using an algorithm that labels the vertices of a connected graph.
* The algorithm labels an endpoint of a longest shortest path as 1, then labels vertices in order of increasing distance from vertex 1, breaking ties by choosing vertices with the fewest unlabeled neighbors. This process is repeated until all vertices are labeled.
* For a connected, chordal, claw-free, narrow graph, the labeling produced by the algorithm has the property that for all vertices m, the neighborhood of m is complete and consists of vertices with labels in an interval. This is proved by induction on m.
* The base case m=1 is proved by contradiction in several cases based on the distances of vertices from vertex 1 and whether certain vertices are adjacent. Assuming the result for m<u, the inductive step for vertex u is proved in cases based on the distances of u's neighbors from vertex 1.
* In each case, assuming the neighborhood of u is not complete or an interval leads to a contradiction, such as an induced claw subgraph or a short cycle with no chords. Narrowness is used to show certain vertices must be adjacent to vertices on a longest shortest path.
* The paper concludes that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. This extends to disconnected graphs by considering connected components.

* Cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at Earth from outside that were discovered in the early 20th century as a source of natural radiation. The cosmic ray spectrum has been observed as a continuum at all energies, with cosmic rays being the source of the highest energy elementary particles known. Techniques that take advantage of extensive air showers are required to measure the high energy tail of the spectrum, which extends up to energies of 3 x 10^20 eV at rates of a few particles per km^2 per century. The cosmic ray spectrum follows a power law that decreases approximately as the cube of the primary energy, and the arrival directions are remarkably isotropic above a few tens of GeV.

* There is increasing evidence for a different component at the high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum, with a change in spectral slope and composition above 10^18 eV. The highest energy events are a challenge to explain theoretically, as they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background over distances of ~50 Mpc if they are protons, and even shorter distances if they are photons or iron nuclei. Possible scenarios involve acceleration in astrophysical sources like young pulsars, gamma ray bursts, active galaxies and the local group of galaxies, or alternatives that avoid acceleration such as annihilation of topological defects or heavy relics from the early universe.

• Cold atoms in optical lattices combine quantum gases from atomic physics and laser theory from quantum optics. Optical lattices are artificial crystals of light formed by interference of laser beams, creating a periodic intensity pattern. By using pairs of laser beams in opposite directions, 1D, 2D, and 3D lattices can be created. Atoms can be cooled and trapped in these optical lattices, effectively forming a crystal of quantum matter.

• While initially used to investigate quantum phenomena like Bloch oscillations and Wannier-Stark ladders, it was the theoretical proposal and experimental realization of the superfluid to Mott insulator (SF-MI) transition that opened the possibility of using optical lattices as a test laboratory for condensed matter physics. The success of the SF-MI transition emanates from the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). BEC was first predicted by Einstein in 1924 based on Bose's work on photon behavior. The breakthrough came in 1995 with the first observation of BEC in rubidium atoms, followed by similar observations in other cold alkali atoms.

• The observation of BEC led to the SF-MI transition, opening the possibility to investigate various condensed matter phenomena using ultracold atoms in optical lattices. This has brought together atomic physicists, quantum opticians, and condensed matter physicists. While most experiments have used cold bosons, the recent observation of MI with fermionic atoms has overcome this limitation. Cold atoms in optical lattices have become an established aspect of physics with its own methods and approaches.

* The M31 globular cluster B158 contains a bright X-ray source called XB158 that was discovered by the Einstein Observatory. XB158 exhibited strong intensity modulation on a 2.78 hr period during XMM-Newton observations in 2002, and similar variation was found in ROSAT and XMM-Newton observations in 1991 and 2000. The modulation amplitude decreased with increasing source intensity, and no modulation was seen in a 2001 XMM-Newton observation. Assuming this 2.78 hr period is the orbital period, XB158 is likely a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary.

* However, XMM-Newton observations in 2000 and 2004 showed deep dips in some orbital cycles but not others, suggesting the disk was precessing. Such behavior is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon in accreting binaries with a mass ratio < 0.3, where the disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the donor star. This causes the disk to elongate, precess, and have enhanced accretion. The donor star modulates the disk's dissipation on the ""superhump"" period a few percent longer than the orbital period.

* This work proposes generalizations of one-dimensional PT-symmetric nonlinear oligomers into two-dimensional plaquettes, which can be used as building blocks for constructing PT-symmetric two-dimensional lattices. Four basic types of plaquettes are introduced, three in the form of four-site squares and one as a five-site cross. The analysis is restricted to modes that can be found analytically, while their stability against small perturbations is analyzed numerically.

* Many effects are found, including solution branches that terminate at critical points of the respective linear PT-symmetric systems, and branches that continue past the critical points due to nonlinearity. Cases are identified where PT symmetry is broken immediately after introducing the gain-loss pattern. The spectral stability of different configurations is examined, with most modes being unstable, although stable branches are found too.

* The perturbed dynamics of the modes is studied, with unstable modes typically leading to amplitude growth at gain-carrying sites and decay at lossy ones. Passive sites without gain or loss can be tipped towards growth or decay depending on the solution. The next step may be to search for more sophisticated stationary modes produced by symmetry breaking of the simplest modes considered.

* The work may pave the way for further considerations of two-dimensional PT-symmetric lattice systems and even three-dimensional ones. Natural generalizations include constructing periodic two-dimensional lattices of the building blocks presented and identifying counterparts of the reported modes in infinite lattices. In three dimensions, examining a PT-symmetric cube of eight sites and the nonlinear modes it supports would be a first step towards constructing full three-dimensional PT-symmetric lattices.

• The cataclysmic variable HU Aqr consists of a 0.80 solar mass white dwarf accreting from a 0.18 solar mass main-sequence companion star in a tight orbit. Irregularities in the observed variations led to explanations including circumbinary planets. Detailed timing analysis concluded that HU Aqr is orbited by two planets: a 5.7 Jupiter mass planet in a 7.1 AU orbit with eccentricity 0.036, and a 7.6 Jupiter mass planet in a wider 12.8 AU orbit with eccentricity 0.18. Although this two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on 10,000 year timescales, a small fraction of simulations show long-term stability.

• Finding planets orbiting a cataclysmic variable is peculiar, but could be common as a consequence of binary formation. Assuming the planets are real, they can constrain the evolution and history of HU Aqr, despite the turbulent common envelope phase that ejected the primary's envelope. The inner planet breaks the degeneracy between the donor mass at Roche lobe overflow, its radius, and the core mass, allowing derivation of the common envelope mass loss rate. The outer planet validates this and determines the birth conditions of HU Aqr.

• Stellar evolution tracks constrain the core mass, radius, and orbital separation at Roche lobe overflow as a function of initial donor mass. The observed white dwarf mass limits the core mass at overflow and provides a minimum companion mass. Stable mass transfer after the common envelope requires the donor-to-accretor mass ratio to be above a critical value. Numerical integration of the inner planet's orbit during the common envelope phase, matching the observed semi-major axis and eccentricity, determines the mass loss rate affecting the planet to be 0.267 solar masses per year.

• Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are now known to be of cosmological origin based on the detection of X-ray, optical and radio afterglows from some well-localized GRBs. The fireball model is strongly favored, but it is still unclear whether GRBs are due to highly collimated jets or isotropic fireballs. Determining the degree of beaming in GRBs is a major unsolved problem. Three methods have been proposed to measure the GRB collimation angle: breaks in the afterglow light curve, polarization of the afterglow, and searches for orphan afterglows.

• Orphan afterglows are afterglows not associated with detectable GRBs, as the initial gamma-ray emission is beamed away from us. The ratio of orphan afterglow rate to GRB rate could allow measurement of the GRB collimation angle. However, this method is extremely difficult in practice. A major problem is that there should be many ""failed GRBs"" (FGRBs) - baryon-contaminated fireballs with low initial Lorentz factors that cannot produce GRBs but can still produce detectable orphan afterglows.

• FGRBs and orphan afterglows from off-axis jetted GRBs can both produce isolated fading objects, making it difficult to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs from orphan afterglow observations alone. Distinguishing between afterglows from FGRBs and off-axis GRBs requires carefully studying the light curves. However, for orphan afterglows, the burst trigger time is unknown, making it challenging to reconstruct the true afterglow light curves.

• Some possible ways to overcome the challenges in using orphan afterglows to constrain GRB beaming angles are discussed.

• The X-ray afterglow spectrum of GRB 011211 was a power-law with photon index ~2, showing no significant absorption above Galactic levels or spectral evolution. The claimed detection of blue-shifted emission lines in the first 5 ks of the observation by Reeves et al.

The X-ray spectrum was similar to GRB 011211, a power-law with photon index ~2 and only Galactic absorption, making it unlikely to be a background AGN.

• The lack of significant X-ray absorption above Galactic levels in both afterglows, despite GRB 001025 having no optical detection, is contrary to expectations if GRBs occur in dense star-forming regions.

• The paper proposes an optical scheme to detect Majorana fermions (MFs) in iron chains on a superconducting lead surface using a coupled quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator (QD-NR) system. MFs are real solutions of the Dirac equation that are their own antiparticles and obey non-Abelian statistics. Although MFs have been predicted to occur in engineered condensed matter systems, observing unique Majorana signatures experimentally remains challenging. Current experimental evidence for MFs largely relies on measurements of tunneling conductance, which is problematic.

• The proposed setup includes iron chains on a superconducting lead surface, where MFs appear at the ends of the chains. A QD is implanted in a NR to form a coupled hybrid QD-NR system. There are two types of coupling in the system: QD-MF coupling and QD-NR coupling. An optical pump-probe scheme is applied to the QD to detect the MFs.

• The Hamiltonian of the whole system includes terms for the QD, NR, MFs, and their couplings. Quantum Langevin equations are derived to describe the dynamics. The linear susceptibility and exciton population of the QD are calculated, which carry signatures of the MFs. Numerical simulations use realistic parameters for an InAs QD and a GaAs NR.

• Without any coupling, the absorption and dispersion spectra of the QD show normal behavior. Turning on QD-NR coupling leads to two sharp peaks corresponding to the NR's vibrational frequency. Considering QD-MF coupling introduces a signature of MFs as an unsymmetric splitting. With both couplings, the spectra show combined features.

• The paper considers two cases for the MFs: coupled MF mode and uncoupled MF mode, depending on the ratio of the iron chain length to the superconducting coherence length. The absorption spectra show different splitting behaviors for the two cases. A phenomenon analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency is observed, referred to as ""Majorana modes induced transparency"".

* The first evidence of time reversal symmetry violation was found in the kaon system, but no other signal has been found despite strong efforts.
* Studying time reversal symmetry has become a cornerstone in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles.
* Theories beyond the Standard Model are formulated in terms of quarks and leptons, while nuclear low energy tests of time reversal symmetry involve hadronic degrees of freedom.
* To relate hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom, quark models designed for the low energy sector can be utilized.
* The two basic contributions to time reversal odd and parity even interactions are a charged rho-meson type exchange and an axial vector exchange.
* The simplest quark operators leading to effective time reversal odd and parity even interactions are a vector type vertex and an axial vector bilinear operator.
* Using the constituent quark model and factorization approximation, the relation between quark and hadronic time reversal odd coupling strengths can be derived.
* Assuming the hadronization process is the same for time reversal odd and even interactions, the factors arising reflect the nucleon structure effects due to spin, isospin, and mass scales.

• Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies. A plausible explosion model involves a white dwarf in a binary system accreting material from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes. Significant progress has been made in this accreting white dwarf model, predicting two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia. Observational confirmation of this scenario requires identifying the companion star that should remain near the explosion site.

• When a companion star is inside the SN Ia ejecta, its spectrum should exhibit broad blue-shifted absorption wings due to Fe I in the expanding ejecta. Calculations show that under certain conditions, the companion star of Tycho's SN should display these distinct Fe I absorption features. However, factors such as an increased number of ionizing photons from the shocked ejecta or lower ionization stages of ions could reduce or erase these features. Despite uncertainties, every SN Ia should have a period where the companion star exhibits these unique absorption features before the ejecta cool and recombine.

• This paper examines the entanglement dynamics of a cascaded qubit system coupled through one-way photon exchange. Quantum trajectory theory is used to unravel the system's conditional dynamics and provide insight beyond the master equation description. Bimodal behavior is demonstrated, with the system either evolving to a maximally entangled Bell state or executing sustained stochastic switching between two Bell states.

• At resonance, the master equation fails to approach a unique steady state, while quantum trajectories reveal distinct possibilities of direct evolution to a Bell state or initiation of an ""entangled-state cycle"". The decision between these outcomes is the result of a competition between periods of evolution between quantum jumps and the jumps themselves. Imperfect coupling is shown to lead to two distinct entangled-state cycles involving symmetric or antisymmetric Bell states.

• The problem of quantifying entanglement in an open system is related to that of tripartite entanglement in a closed system involving the open system and its environment. Quantum trajectories allow extracting classical information from the environment, enabling the system state to remain pure conditioned on this information. This contextual entanglement, dependent on the measurements made on the environment, cannot be captured by the density operator alone.

• The density operator should not be treated as a fundamental object, as it does not provide a complete description of the physical state. Entropy in the density operator implies discarded information about entanglement with an external system. Considering the process generating the mixed state and the conditional dynamics it enables can provide additional insights into the entanglement.

• This paper studies the infrared emission anisotropy of luminous AGN at redshift z~1 using an isotropically selected sample of quasars and radio galaxies. The average SEDs of the quasars (type 1 AGN) and radio galaxies (type 2 AGN) were compared to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy.

• The emission ratio of type 1 to type 2 AGN decreases from 20 to 2 over 2-8 μm, with a slight increase in the 10 μm silicate feature, and flattens to ~1.4 at 15 μm. This anisotropy needs to be accounted for when using IR-selected flux-limited samples.

• The ""shift"" between the peaks of the silicate emission and absorption features was found, consistent with previous studies. This is likely due to a change in dust chemistry within the torus.

• The observed anisotropy is consistent with the AGN unification scheme where the difference between type 1 and 2 AGN is due to the viewing angle of the dusty torus. A clumpy torus model reproduces the observed type 1/type 2 ratio reasonably well.

• The anisotropy is lower than that found for nearby, lower-luminosity, radio-quiet AGN in some studies. This may be explained by a receding torus model with luminosity-dependent obscuration.

• The relatively small anisotropy is consistent with the torus being clumpy rather than smooth. Cold dust extinction in the host galaxy alone cannot explain the observations.

• Further studies are needed to confirm if the difference in anisotropy between high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and low-luminosity radio-quiet AGN is real, and to understand the underlying physical causes. The isotropic selection of the sample helps minimize bias in the anisotropy estimates.

• The goal of the development of the code was to have a simple and efficient tool for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models, with an emphasis on accuracy. The code offers flexibility in the choice of integration method and the ability to determine all frequencies of a given model in a specified range of degree and frequency. The equilibrium model is defined using a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as the mass and radius of the model. Fairly extensive documentation is provided with the code distribution package.

• The equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations are expressed in terms of a set of dimensionless variables. For nonradial oscillations, the displacement vector is written using spherical harmonics, and the equations are solved on an interval from the center to a point in the stellar atmosphere. Boundary conditions are obtained from series expansions at the center and surface of the star.

• The code permits solving the oscillation equations using shooting or relaxation methods. In the shooting method, solutions satisfying the boundary conditions are integrated separately from the inner and outer boundary, and the eigenvalue is found by matching these solutions at a suitable fitting point. The relaxation method solves the equations together with boundary conditions and a normalization condition using a relaxation technique, and the eigenvalue is found by requiring continuity at an interior matching point.

• To improve the precision of the computed frequencies, the code can apply a variational principle or Richardson extrapolation. The code also determines the order of the mode based on the number of zeros in the eigenfunction. The normalized mode inertia is calculated as a measure of the characteristics of the mode. Several revisions and extensions to the code are under development or being considered.

The lack of an obvious discontinuity suggests star formation proceeded continuously with possible variations in intensity but no large gaps. The absence of a conspicuous horizontal branch, given Leo I's low metallicity, implies the fraction of stars older than ~10 Gyr is small.

The main result shows that the principal eigenvalue remains bounded as the drift strength goes to infinity if and only if there exists a non-trivial first integral of the drift vector field in an appropriate Sobolev space. The proof uses the Green function and heat kernel estimates of the perturbed fractional Laplacian, as well as approximation techniques for flows and the Krein-Rutman theorem. The non-locality of the fractional Laplacian requires substantial modifications compared to the case of local operators.

The attainability of the infimum in the main result is established using weak convergence arguments.

• This work explores using unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify phase transitions in physical systems without prior knowledge of the order parameter. Principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis, autoencoders, and variational autoencoders are compared for this task. Variational autoencoders are found to be the most advanced and scalable unsupervised learning algorithm that can handle nonlinear features in the data.

• The variational autoencoder is applied to the Ising model and XY model. For the Ising model, the autoencoder learns a latent parameter that closely approximates the magnetization order parameter, and the reconstruction loss changes drastically at the critical temperature, serving as a universal indicator of the phase transition. Expanding to two latent dimensions does not provide much additional information for the Ising model.

• For the antiferromagnetic Ising model, the autoencoder is sensitive to the microscopic differences in spin contributions to the order parameter compared to the ferromagnetic case. The latent parameter correlates with the staggered magnetization, and the reconstructions accurately capture the antiferromagnetic order. In the XY model with continuous symmetry, the autoencoder embeds the different realizations of the ordered phase into two latent parameters, with the norm of the latent vector serving as the order parameter.

• The success of the variational autoencoder for unsupervised learning of phase transitions opens possibilities for predicting unknown phases and uncovering hidden order parameters in complex systems like quantum spin liquids. Deep convolutional autoencoders are a promising future direction to further reduce the number of parameters and promote locality in feature selection, potentially providing insights into connections with renormalization group techniques.

The authors use a Monte Carlo simulation code, GEANT4, to calculate the gamma-ray spectra arising from these interactions for clouds of various densities. They find that the emissivity drops rapidly with increasing cloud column-density above a certain threshold.

They adopt a cored isothermal sphere model for the cloud density distribution and an analytical model based on numerical simulations for the cosmic-ray distribution. The predicted gamma-ray intensity is compared to observational data from the EGRET detector.

• Previous studies argued that gamma-ray observations tightly constrain the amount of baryonic dark matter in the galactic halo. However, the authors show that these constraints are much weaker for high column-density clouds due to their lower emissivity. They re-evaluate the constraints using the discrepancy between the observed intensity and current galactic emission models as a measure of the uncertainty.

• The authors find that at high galactic latitudes, the gamma-ray data limits the amount of low column-density gas to 7% of the total dark matter density, but this fraction rises to 100% for gas clouds with column densities greater than 100 g cm^-2. For the inner galactic disk, the data indicates that the entire dark halo could be composed of dense clouds with column densities exceeding 100 g cm^-2.

This is because the emission from a baryonic dark halo would be coupled to the galactic cosmic-ray distribution and would not be isotropic. Additionally, a highly structured dark matter halo might exhibit low dark matter column density along certain lines of sight by chance.

The outburst had a double-peaked structure of low brightness compared to other outbursts from 1895 to 2007. The double structure is explained by the collision of the white dwarf (WD) wind with two ejected shells from the red giant (RG).

• The minimum of the light curve between the peaks is accompanied by a dip in the ionization parameter, constrained by modeling the UV line spectra in Nov-Dec 1985. The sharp drop is due to a sudden increase in distance between the WD and the downstream nebula reached by the WD's black body flux, caused by collision with a new RG shell. The lack of time for grain development in the recently formed shell is revealed by the solar Si/H abundance.

• The outburst did not reach maximum luminosity likely because the wind network collision was distorted by the next shell. Small peaks before and after the 1984-1986 burst, with a periodicity of 300-400 days, are probably due to RG shell ejections. Unlike other outbursts, the 1984-1986 event did not show broad lines or collimated jets.

• The distances of the nebulae from the system center are calculated by adjusting continuum fluxes. Results suggest the ionization parameter drop in Nov-Dec 1985 derives from a sudden increase in distance due to ejection of the next RG shell.

• The paper proposes a scheme for implementing a 3-qubit Grover's search algorithm using 4-level SQUIDs coupled to a superconducting resonator. The scheme is based on generating and absorbing a single photon in a high-Q cavity using the SQUIDs. Compared to previous proposals using flying qubits, this scheme uses stationary qubits defined through the two lowest levels of the SQUIDs.

• The implementation uses 3-qubit phase gates and single-qubit gates, and has a fast operation time on the order of nanoseconds. It does not require adjusting level spacing during operation, using slowly changing Rabi frequencies, or second-order detuning. Different coupling constants between each SQUID and the resonator can accommodate unavoidable non-uniformity in device parameters.

• The effects of imperfections like cavity field decay, relevant level decay, and unwanted off-resonant interactions during gate implementation are considered. Results show the marked state can still be searched with high fidelity in the presence of these imperfections. The paper concludes this scheme for implementing the 3-qubit Grover's algorithm using SQUIDs is fast and robust to certain imperfections.

* This paper presents a detailed derivation of core-level spectra in 2D systems, with numerical results for pristine and doped free-standing graphene. Although pristine graphene is not a metal, its core-level spectrum shows peak tailing characteristic of metallic systems.

* The tailing increases with doping for concentrations exceeding 10^12 cm^-2, and the peak shape changes further with increasing doping concentration. This provides a complementary way to estimate the degree of doping in a sample.

* The results are compared to three different experimental spectra from two groups, showing good agreement. A convenient way to introduce the effect of Gaussian instrumental broadening into the formalism is also presented.

* The derivation uses a model Hamiltonian with the core hole interacting with bosonic excitations (plasmons and electron-hole pairs) in the 2D system. The core-hole spectrum is related to the density of states of the core electron.

* In the sudden approximation, the core-hole potential is turned on instantaneously, leading to shake-up effects from plasmon and electron-hole pair excitations. These are treated using a boson propagator and the dynamical structure factor.

* The final expression for the XPS spectrum includes Lorentzian broadening from the core-hole lifetime and Gaussian instrumental broadening. Numerical results are presented for different doping levels in graphene.

The method is verified using standard stars with interferometric temperatures and Hipparcos parallaxes.

• The effects of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure have been detected in samples of high redshift QSOs, intermediate redshift galaxies, and GRBs. For point sources like QSOs and GRBs, weak lensing manifests as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass. Another more direct way to detect weak lensing is to use fluxes of standard candles like supernovae type Ia (SNIa).

• The authors analyze a sample of 50 high-redshift SNIa to look for signatures of weak lensing in their observed fluxes. They find that brighter SNIa tend to be preferentially located behind regions with higher projected number densities of foreground galaxies. This relation between SNIa brightness and foreground galaxy density has a statistical significance of >99% and is consistent with the effects of weak lensing.

• The authors consider galactic dust as an alternative explanation but conclude it is unlikely based on the lack of correlation between the SNIa brightnesses/foreground galaxy densities and galactic extinction estimates. They construct models of weak lensing that incorporate different mass distributions, galaxy biasing schemes, and SNIa intrinsic brightness dispersion. The models indicate that the slope of the brightness-density relation depends sensitively on the amount and distribution of matter along the line of sight but not on the details of galaxy biasing.

• Standard models of mass distribution have some difficulty reproducing the observed slope of the brightness-density relation. Larger lensing optical depths and broader convergence probability distributions than normally assumed are needed to match the observations. This suggests that mass fluctuations on ~few Mpc scales may be more extreme than predicted by standard models.

• The insensitivity of the brightness-density relation slope to biasing makes it a clean probe of mass distribution, in contrast to other lensing effects like QSO-galaxy correlations where biasing can enhance the signal.

DNA in cells constantly interacts with proteins and other subcellular structures in a crowded, nonequilibrium environment. Recent experiments have measured the forces exerted on DNA in cells and the effects of tension on DNA looping kinetics. Theoretical models have been developed to understand DNA looping, but a unifying framework is lacking.

* The authors performed Brownian dynamics simulations of semiflexible polymers modeled as extensible wormlike chains to study the effects of static and fluctuating tension on looping kinetics. They used a mean-field approximation for the looping free energy and calculated looping times as mean first-passage times over the free energy barrier. With static tension, looping times steeply increased with applied tension, in agreement with simulations and distinct from previous theories.

* For fluctuating tension, the authors considered a dichotomically fluctuating force and found that looping times were reduced compared to the static tension case. Importantly, a resonant activation phenomenon was observed, where the looping time reached a minimum at an optimal flipping time of the fluctuating force. The looping time was more sensitive to tension for longer polymer chains.

* The simulation results agree well with recent experimental data on DNA looping under tension. The sensitivity of looping kinetics to small tensions is an emergent property resulting from polymer chain cooperativity. A theory incorporating the full complexity of DNA looping is still needed for quantitative comparison to experiments.

* The authors also studied the resonant activation phenomenon in more detail by varying the amplitude and flipping time of the fluctuating tension. The optimal flipping time increased and the minimum looping time decreased with increasing chain length. This behavior is an extension of the classic resonant activation of a single Brownian particle crossing a fluctuating energy barrier.

* The problem involves determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations, calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange, and solving for the change in orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity over time. Low-frequency g-modes of stellar oscillations play an important role and are determined by the Brunt-Väisälä frequency in the star.

* This paper proposes a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment, based on the analysis of intensity fluctuations. The method relies on measuring the temporal fluctuations of the total power emitted by the sources or the speckle contrast in the far-field intensity pattern. The fluctuations or speckle contrast are shown to be directly related to the imaginary part of the Green's function connecting the two source points, also known as the cross density of states (CDOS).

* The CDOS counts the number of photonic eigenmodes connecting the two source points at a given frequency and encodes their relative distance. Measuring the CDOS from intensity fluctuations or speckle contrast provides a way to retrieve the Green's function between two points in a complex medium, as an alternative to field-field correlation techniques used in Green's function retrieval methods based on ambient noise correlations. The possibility to measure power fluctuations instead of field-field correlations might be an advantage for electromagnetic Green's function retrieval in the visible or near-IR frequency range.

* In the presence of multiple scattering, the CDOS fluctuations can be accessed from measurements of the directional intensity or speckle contrast, providing a resolution that is not limited by diffraction, but by the microstructure of the scattering medium. An explicit expression of the intensity correlation function or speckle contrast in terms of the relative distance between the sources is given in the weak scattering limit, which could be of practical interest for sensing the interdistance between emitters embedded in biological tissues. The results suggest that multiple scattering can actually enhance the performance of sensing, imaging and communication techniques.

* The approach presented in this paper opens up new possibilities for sensing the relative distance between emitters in complex media, with a precision not limited by diffraction. It also provides an alternative way to measure the Green's function in a complex medium from the intensity noise due to two fluctuating incoherent sources at a single point, which could simplify the Green's function retrieval technique compared to the usual two-point field-field correlation approach.

The GWLC model has been successful in describing viscoelastic behavior of polymer solutions and living cells. This paper extends the GWLC model to situations involving reversible inelastic deformations, where bonds between polymers can transiently break and reform without altering the microscopic ground state.

• The extended inelastic GWLC model exhibits hallmarks of nonlinear cell mechanics including stress stiffening, fluidization, and cyclic softening. A competition is observed between force-amplitude dependent stress-stiffening and force-rate dependent yielding events. If the force reaches a yield force, the bond fraction sharply decreases, switching the response from stiffening to a pronounced softening and more fluid-like behavior. The yield force depends on the deformation rate, and repeated deformations lead to cyclic softening or inelastic shakedown.

• The WLC component provides the constitutive relation governing the bond kinetics and filters the dynamic remodeling of the bond network. The model can be further extended to account for irreversible plastic deformations by allowing transiently broken bonds to reform at new sites.

Despite the same linear dependence of thickness on grafting density, the equilibrium conformation histograms differ noticeably for brushes of polyampholytes with different flexibilities.

PTC follows the solution of the dynamical system accurately in early stages until steady state is approached, then increases the time step to gain rapid convergence while sacrificing some temporal accuracy.

Sufficient conditions for convergence of PTC have been proven for ODE and semi-explicit index-1 DAE systems.

The model can be represented as a singularly perturbed system with fast and slow time scales.

* The quasi steady-state (QSS) model assumes the fast dynamics are infinitely fast and can be represented by algebraic equations. Both the long-term stability model and QSS model can be decoupled into two subsystems when discrete variables change values.

* PTC is modified for the long-term stability model to ensure consistent initial conditions by switching to implicit integration when discrete variables jump. For the QSS model, PTC is used to overcome numerical difficulties encountered by implicit integration methods.

When the QSS model encountered numerical issues, PTC overcame the difficulties and provided good accuracy with a 5x speedup over the full model with implicit trapezoidal integration.

The method reproduces previous results for scattering on a circular cylinder potential and 2D scattering of polarized dipoles with high efficiency.

The interaction potential can be anisotropic, and varying the incident wave direction is equivalent to rotating the potential. The problem is solved by expanding the wave function in a Fourier basis on an angular grid, reducing the Schrödinger equation to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations.

* Permutations of integers are a basic building block for succinct encoding of various data structures. Trivial encoding of a permutation takes n log n bits, which is within O(n) bits of the information theory lower bound. Many applications require efficient computation of both the permutation π and its inverse π^(-1).
* Various measures of presortedness in a permutation have been studied, such as runs (ascending subsequences), strict runs (each element at most 1 larger than the previous), and shuffled upsequences (subsequences that can be removed to leave the permutation sorted). Algorithms to sort permutations based on these measures take advantage of permutations that are closer to sorted order. Each sorting algorithm yields a compression scheme for permutations that is effective on the classes of permutations the algorithm sorts efficiently.
* The authors present encodings of permutations that support efficient computation of π and π^(-1) and are compact for permutations with few runs, strict runs, or shuffled upsequences. The encoding schemes use o(n log n) bits for ""easy"" permutations while still using O(n log n) bits for all permutations. They also prove lower bounds on the number of comparisons needed to sort permutations with a given number and distribution of runs, strict runs, or shuffled upsequences.
* The permutation encodings are applied to compress various data structures such as inverted indexes, suffix arrays, and integer functions. For inverted indexes of natural language text, compression is achieved by encoding the sequence of word positions including run-length encoding of differences between positions. For suffix arrays, compression is achieved by encoding the Burrows-Wheeler transform which tends to have long runs in its output.
* Encoding integer functions via ""hairy permutations"" - a bijective part encoded as a permutation and an injective part encoded as a forest of trees - allows compression of functions with ""easy"" bijective and injective parts. Degree entropy compression is used for the forest of trees. The encoding supports efficient evaluation of the function and its iterates.

* The study of chimera states, where coherent and incoherent oscillators coexist, has been the focus of extensive research in various models, from Kuramoto phase oscillators to periodic and chaotic maps. The first experimental evidence of chimera states was found in populations of coupled chemical oscillators and optical coupled-map lattices. Recently, chimeras were shown to emerge naturally from a competition between two antagonistic synchronization patterns in a mechanical experiment involving metronomes. In the context of neuroscience, it is believed that chimera states might explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in birds and dolphins.

* This paper identifies single and multi-chimera states in networks of non-locally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) oscillators, which are a more realistic model for single neuron dynamics compared to the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. The 2D-HR model is first studied, where each oscillator is coupled to R nearest neighbors symmetrically on both sides. Parameter values for which chimeras appear are identified, and a new ""mixed oscillatory state"" (MOS) is discovered, where desynchronized neurons are uniformly distributed among those attracted by a stable stationary state.

* Chimera-like patterns are also discovered in the 2D-HR model when only the membrane potential variables are coupled. In the more realistic 3D-HR model, where a third variable representing a slowly varying current is added, only states of complete synchronization and MOS are observed when the first two variables are coupled symmetrically. However, when coupling is allowed only among the membrane potential variables, chimera states are discovered in cases where spiking occurs within sufficiently long bursting intervals.

* The study considers N nonlocally coupled HR oscillators, where interconnections exist with R nearest neighbors on either side. The system contains direct and cross-coupling between variables, modeled by a rotational coupling matrix. The collective behavior is investigated in relation to network parameters N, R, φ, σx, and σy.

• Kauffman networks are disordered dynamical systems proposed as a model for genetic regulatory systems. They exhibit a dynamical phase transition between a frozen phase and a chaotic phase, determined by the connectivity parameter K and the bias parameter p. The critical line separating the phases has properties reminiscent of real cells.

• The authors introduce the concept of relevant elements, which are the elements that influence the long-term dynamics of the system. They present an approximate argument predicting the scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size in the different phases. In the frozen phase, the number of relevant elements is independent of system size, while on the critical line, it scales as the square root of the system size.

• The authors perform numerical simulations to study the distribution of relevant elements and its connection to the properties of the attractors. In the chaotic phase, the average cycle length grows almost exponentially with the number of relevant elements for large values. On the critical line, the number of relevant elements scales as the square root of the system size, while the number of unstable elements scales linearly.

• The average weight of the attraction basins has a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the number of relevant elements, both in the chaotic phase and on the critical line. However, on the critical line, the range where the average weight decreases is much wider, and the curves for smaller system sizes are lower. This difference is related to the modular organization of Kauffman networks.

• The authors discuss the limitations of the annealed approximation and propose a new approximation scheme that takes into account the existence of periodic attractors. They show that this approximation can account for the observed finite-size effects, such as the larger stable core and the longer time to reach the stationary distribution of stable elements in smaller systems.

* This paper studies spin-superflow turbulence (SST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature using the spin-1 spinor Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations. The authors theoretically and numerically investigate the energy spectra of the superflow kinetic energy and spin-dependent interaction energy. They find that both the -5/3 power law (Kolmogorov spectrum) in the kinetic energy and the -7/3 power law in the spin-dependent interaction energy can appear in SST. The Kolmogorov spectrum in SST is generated by the nonlinear spin term in the equation of motion for the superfluid velocity, which is different from the mechanism in classical turbulence.

* Numerical simulations of the spin-1 spinor GP equations with a phenomenological small-scale energy dissipation confirm the emergence of the -5/3 and -7/3 power laws in SST in a two-dimensional system. The SST is generated by the counterflow instability, and the energy is transferred from low to high wave numbers. The authors estimate the magnitude of the inertial term and the nonlinear spin term in the wave number space, numerically verifying that the Kolmogorov spectrum originates from the nonlinear spin term.

* The dependence of the energy spectra on the relative velocity between the components is discussed. A large relative velocity shortens the time period sustaining the Kolmogorov spectrum in the kinetic energy due to the modulation of the total density and high energy injection wave number. However, the -7/3 power law in the spin-dependent interaction energy spectrum appears independently of the relative velocity.

* The possibility of an inverse energy cascade in the two-dimensional SST is considered. The authors argue that the inverse cascade for the kinetic energy does not occur because the enstrophy in the ferromagnetic spin-1 spinor BEC is not conserved, which is supported by the numerical results. For the spin-dependent interaction energy, the inverse cascade may occur due to the ferromagnetic interaction, but further investigation is needed to clar",0,"{'n_points': 4, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 16, 'symbol': '*'}"

* The Kondo lattice model (KLM) describes localized magnetic moments coupled to a metallic host of conduction electrons, with competing energy scales of Kondo screening and RKKY interaction. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations were performed to investigate the KLM ground state, mapping out the magnetic phase diagram as a function of coupling J and conduction electron density n_c. The DCA was extended to allow for symmetry-breaking antiferromagnetic order, and results for half-band filling and hole-doping were discussed. The single-particle spectral function was calculated and compared well with exact lattice QMC results.

* At half-filling with particle-hole symmetry, a magnetic order-disorder transition occurs between insulating states. Including next-nearest neighbor hopping t' shifts the transition to lower J values. The spectral function shows a Kondo insulating state with an indirect gap for large J, while for smaller J, antiferromagnetic order develops with the appearance of shadow bands. The quasi-particle gap tracks the Kondo scale from weak to strong coupling.

* Upon hole-doping, the antiferromagnetic order survives initially but vanishes smoothly at a quantum critical point with increasing doping. The evolution of the spectral function indicates three distinct Fermi surface topologies: a large Fermi surface with hole pockets at (π/2,π/2) in the paramagnetic phase, a backfolded Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic phase near the transition, and a small Fermi surface with hole pockets at (π,π) deeper in the antiferromagnetic phase. The transition between Fermi surface topologies occurs continuously within the ordered phase.

* The DCA results show no evidence of a Kondo breakdown across the magnetic order-disorder transition or within the antiferromagnetic phase. The absence of a Kondo breakdown is supported by the continuous evolution of the quasiparticle weight and the presence of a heavy-fermion band in the spectral function throughout the phase diagram.

* The paper investigates gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and Weyl anomaly, using the method of dispersion relations. The relevant amplitude, the two-point function of energy-momentum tensors, is separated into its pure tensor and pseudo-tensor parts and decomposed into 8 formfactors. These formfactors are expressed by dispersion relations, where only the imaginary parts need to be calculated via Cutkosky rules. The subtraction procedure for the formfactors is the natural choice dictated by the behavior of the imaginary parts.

* The pure tensor Ward identity for the renormalized formfactors is satisfied in the massless limit, shifting the total anomaly into the pseudo-tensor part. The anomalous Ward identity and trace identity depend only on one finite formfactor, demonstrating independence from the renormalization procedure. From these identities, the linearized gravitational anomalies (Einstein and Weyl) and their covariant versions are deduced.

* The origin of the anomaly is a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of a specific formfactor. In the massless limit, the imaginary part approaches a delta-function singularity at zero momentum squared, exhibiting the infrared feature of gravitational anomalies.

* The mission requires a highly elliptical orbit, precise time/frequency links between the spacecraft and ground, and precise orbit determination. Drag forces, rotational accelerations, and micro-vibrations pose challenges that drive the spacecraft and instrument design.

* The spacecraft has an octagonal shape with the instruments in the central protected region, and features a chemical propulsion system, laser communication terminals, and GNSS receivers. Extensive thermal control and electrical power provisions are required to meet the payload demands.

* STE-QUEST would complement other fundamental physics missions like ACES, MICROSCOPE and STEP. While several critical implementation issues exist, such as payload maturity and ground clock performance, the assessment phase found no insurmountable hurdles.

* Pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic waves from ground transmitters are used to sound the density profile and drift velocity of the ionosphere. In 1971, it was theoretically shown that if the injected HF radio beams are strong enough, weak-turbulence parametric instabilities would be excited in the ionospheric plasma.

* Ionospheric modification experiments at Platteville, Colorado demonstrated heating of electrons, deformation of ionosonde traces, excitation of spread F, etc. after the HF transmitter was turned on. The triggering of weak-turbulence parametric instabilities was first observed in 1970 at Arecibo, Puerto Rico using a scatter radar diagnostic technique.

* A decade later, experiments at Tromsø found that under similar conditions as in Arecibo, strong, structured, wide-band secondary HF radiation escapes from the interaction region. This and other observations showed that complex interactions including weak and strong EM turbulence and harmonic generation are excited.

* Numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence, such as Langmuir turbulence and upper-hybrid/lower-hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas.

* The paper develops a geometrical method to classify and visualize homogeneous isotropic cosmologies in multi-scalar models with an arbitrary scalar potential V. In the first step, the target space of the N scalar fields is augmented to an (N+1)-dimensional Lorentzian space, with the logarithm of the scale factor acting as time. All flat (k=0) cosmologies are geodesics with respect to a conformally rescaled metric on this augmented target space, with the conformal factor depending on the scale factor and potential.

• The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to study periodic advance of glaciers on Earth. It refers to the nonmonotone dependence of a system's response on noise added to a periodic input signal. An extensive review of stochastic resonance and its applications can be found in @xcite.

• From a statistical perspective, stochastic resonance is the phenomenon where adding noise to a signal can improve its transmission in terms of statistical quantities. The problem is to estimate a signal transmitted through a channel and detected by a receiver only if it is louder than a threshold. Adding an optimal level of noise can make the signal observable and allow inference on the original signal.

• This paper studies the problem of estimation and hypothesis testing for a model with a subthreshold constant non-negative signal, a noise that is a diffusion process trajectory, and a perturbed signal. Two observation schemes are proposed: observing the proportion of time the perturbed signal is over the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold. Estimators are proposed for both schemes and their asymptotic properties are studied, demonstrating the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in an example.

• The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors has been shown to have predominantly a d-wave pairing symmetry up to the critical temperature Tc, as determined by phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. When a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO2 planes, the longitudinal thermal conductivity shows a fourfold oscillation that can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the quasiparticle energy spectrum, assuming a d-wave gap. However, deviations from the expected angular pattern within a pure d-wave symmetry have been attributed to vortex pinning effects. The angular variation of thermal conductivity depends on quasiparticle heat transport, their interaction with supercurrents, and the order parameter symmetry.

• This paper investigates the temperature range where the nodal gap characteristics are directly observable by thermal conductivity and whether thermal activation of quasiparticles with increasing temperature can explain the experimental results, particularly the change in symmetry of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. Angle scans were performed on two YBa2Cu3O7 single crystals to measure the angular variation of longitudinal thermal conductivity in a magnetic field parallel to the CuO2 planes. The results agree with the theoretical model and confirm the predominance of the d-wave gap up to Tc. The measurements also provide new insights into thermal transport at temperatures where the nodal gap properties are not directly observable.

At low temperatures, a fourfold oscillation in thermal conductivity was observed when the field was rotated from 0° to 360°. As temperature increased, the fourfold oscillation was no longer observable, which can be understood by the thermal activation of quasiparticles at different orientations from the gap nodes. The oscillation amplitudes were smaller in the untwinned sample, possibly due to a larger concentration of impurity scatterers.

• Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive features such as calculable soft SUSY breaking terms and solving the SUSY flavor and CP problems. However, they suffer from tachyonic slepton masses. The minimal AMSB model (mAMSB) solves this by adding a universal scalar mass m0, while hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB) allows the bino mass M1 to be the only non-anomaly mediated soft term.

• In HCAMSB, the bino mass M1 can lead to a small perturbation or dominate the AMSB contribution to soft terms. The parameter α governs the relative bino to anomaly mediated contributions. HCAMSB can lead to a phenomenologically viable spectrum, with the parameter space given by m3/2, α, tan β, and sign(μ).

• Differences between mAMSB and HCAMSB spectra include: highly split left-right sfermion masses and lighter 3rd generation squarks in HCAMSB; different mass orderings and compositions of neutralinos and charginos; and a decreasing μ term with increasing α in HCAMSB. The wino-like lightest chargino and neutralino are nearly degenerate as usual in AMSB models.

Many researchers have developed numerical schemes to solve convection-diffusion problems accurately and efficiently. This paper presents numerical solutions using differential quadrature methods (DQM) with modified cubic B-splines as base functions. The methods transform the problem into a system of first-order ODEs in time, which is solved using the SSP-RK54 scheme.

• Three DQM methods are used: modified trigonometric cubic B-spline DQM (MTB-DQM), modified exponential cubic B-spline DQM (MEXP-DQM), and modified extended cubic B-spline DQM (MECDQ). The weighting coefficients for the derivatives are computed using the base functions and Shu's recursive formulae. The stability of the methods is analyzed using eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix, confirming stable solutions for 2D convection-diffusion equations.

• Three test problems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are studied numerically using the proposed methods. The accuracy and efficiency are measured using discrete error norms (average and maximum). The proposed solutions are more accurate compared to existing schemes and agree well with exact solutions.

• For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the order of accuracy is cubic when ∆x=∆y and super-linear otherwise. For Neumann boundary conditions, the order of accuracy is quadratic with respect to error norms. The methods are found to be stable for the 2D convection-diffusion equation using matrix stability analysis.

* The axial anomaly represents a fundamental issue in quantum field theory and has been analyzed deeply over the years through renormalization procedures and the path integral formalism. Dolgov and Zakharov showed an alternative approach to the axial anomaly by studying the triangular diagram through dispersion relations, interpreting it as an infrared phenomenon due to a singularity in the chiral limit in the absorbitive part of the diagram. This infrared aspect is complementary to the more familiar ultraviolet one emerging from renormalization.

* The authors attempt to relate the Dolgov and Zakharov approach to some effects in the dynamics of physical reactions, such as the radiative decays of pions and Z bosons. They calculate the corresponding decay rates for cases where the outgoing leptons are in a definite helicity state and examine the structure of mass singularities and their cancellation. They study how the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem applies and consider the analogies and differences with respect to the corresponding unpolarized decay rates.

* The authors conclude that the Dolgov and Zakharov treatment of the axial anomaly can be extended to processes characterized by a lepton changing helicity by emitting a photon, and the presence of a term independent of the lepton mass in the corresponding decay rates is related to the axial anomaly. They find that for helicity changing processes, the cancellation of collinear singularities occurs through a mechanism different from the usual one of real and virtual compensation, and the collinear singularity cancellation mechanism is controlled by the anomalous breaking of chiral symmetry.

Using the homological hypotheses on the cobordism and the H1(Y)-action on the Heegaard Floer groups, the problem is reduced to the case of a cobordism map corresponding to 2-handle additions only, which can be represented combinatorially by a multi-pointed triple Heegaard diagram.

* This paper extends the results of Yetter on the infinitesimal deformation theory of pasting diagrams of @xmath0-linear categories, functors, and natural transformations, establishing that obstructions are cocycles for deformation complexes of general pasting diagrams.
* The paper uses a method developed by Shrestha involving polygons with edges labeled by arrow-valued operations to encode cocycle conditions, obstruction formulas, and cobounding conditions.
* By reducing deformations of any pasting diagram to those of a related diagram whose cells have a small set of forms, the paper shows that obstructions to deforming any pasting diagram are cocycles, provided certain cells are deformed trivially.

• The aim in physics is not just to calculate observables correctly, but to understand the physical picture behind phenomena. Fundamental degrees of freedom often become too complicated, so the essential degrees of freedom at the relevant scale must be identified.
• In crystals, the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons and the electromagnetic field, but the essential degrees of freedom for properties like conductivity are ""heavy electrons"", phonons and their interactions. Similarly, while the fundamental degrees of freedom in QCD are quarks and gluons, at the 1 GeV scale the essential degrees of freedom are constituent quarks interacting by meson exchange and subject to confinement.
• Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is the most important QCD phenomenon for light and strange baryons at low energies. It leads to an octet of light pseudoscalar mesons as Goldstone bosons, and causes current quarks to gain a dynamical mass and become constituent quarks.
• In the low-energy regime, baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by exchange of pseudoscalar, vector and scalar mesons. The short-range part of the pseudoscalar and vector meson exchange interactions is crucial, producing a strong spin-flavor force between quarks.
• The pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges produce a short-range spin-spin force of the same sign, while their tensor forces largely cancel. The spin-orbit force from vector meson exchange is important in the NN interaction but cancels in baryons due to its explicit flavor dependence.
• In baryons, the spin-spin interaction between constituent quarks dominates and explains the hyperfine splittings, while net spin-orbit and tensor forces are weak as evidenced by the small splittings in LS multiplets. A simple model with harmonic confinement and a flavor-spin interaction proportional to λ_i·λ_j σ_i·σ_j illustrates how the chiral interaction accounts for the ordering of positive and negative parity states.
• In a more realistic chiral constituent quark model including relativistic kinetic energy, linear confinement, and pseudoscalar, scalar and vector meson exchanges, a unified description of light",0,"{'n_points': 8, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 16, 'symbol': '•'}"

• The invention relates to a blender container with a set of high-speed blades mounted inside the lower portion. Early blender containers were made of glass, but manufacturers switched to reinforced plastic like acrylic resin for cost efficiency, durability and rigidity. However, over time the inner wall of plastic containers gets nicked from impacts, and debris can mix into the blended liquid, causing hygiene issues. The inventors previously patented a metal lining to shield the inner wall of the container.

* The garnish pick is typically 2-5 inches long to span the distance from the rim to the bottom center of a martini glass, with a maximum diameter of 15 cm or less that tapers towards the sharp skewering end to avoid damaging garnishes. The main shaft and appendages can have various cross-sectional shapes, curves, bends, bumps, ridges, twists, and corkscrews along their length. They can also have sub-appendages branching off and be made of different materials like wood, plastic, rubber, metal, glass or ceramic.

Many medical procedures like defibrillating, pacing the heart, and stimulating breathing can be enhanced if the electrode is positioned close to the organ being treated.

• The prior application was directed to an esophageal displacement electrode with a semi-rigid plastic tube carrying an electrode at the distal end.

* The invention describes a device and method for treating wounds and regenerating tissues using fluid supply and suction drainage through a porous dressing. The device eliminates hydrostatic pressure in the fluid supply by positioning the fluid bag level with the wound. It allows the fluid to be sucked through the dressing pores by the suction pump used for negative pressure wound therapy.

* The device includes a pole with an adjustable rest that holds the fluid bag and can be positioned at the same height as the wound. A level measuring device like a horizontal level meter, ultrasound sensor, or laser pointer helps match the height of the fluid bag to the wound. The fluid supply is connected to the dressing with tubing and can be controlled by a drip chamber, roller clamp, and injection port.

* The suction is applied through a separate drainage port on the dressing. To prevent the dressing pores from getting blocked, the drainage port contains an open grid that maximizes the dressing area exposed to suction. The level of suction applied ranges from -20 to -200 mmHg for non-regenerative treatment and from 0 to -30 mmHg for regenerative treatment of tissues.

* For intermittent fluid administration, an injection port with an elastic membrane is used to add fluid to the dressing during ongoing suction without allowing air to enter. The injected fluid distributes evenly through the dressing. Fluid supply is stopped once fluid is seen in the drainage tubing.

* When using the device for tissue regeneration on a tissue scaffold, the hydrostatic and suction pressures are minimized to avoid disturbing cell growth and diffusion.

* The present invention relates to a skin reflectance measuring apparatus. The measurement of skin reflectance finds applications in pathology and cosmetology, such as studying seborrhea and other skin diseases, and measuring the effect of anti-reflectance products. Existing methods and devices used in industry for measuring surface reflectance are not applicable to measuring skin reflectance. A first problem is the influence of color, which can be overcome by using a relative measurement between specular and diffuse reflection.

* However, known devices using relative measurement remain inappropriate for measuring skin reflectance. Industrial apparatuses generally use optical systems with focusing lenses that require accurate positioning on a flat surface with a relatively large measuring area. For skin measurement, the measuring area needs to be small to keep skin characteristics uniform and avoid changing them by flattening the skin. An easy-to-handle measuring apparatus that does not require highly accurate positioning is important.

* The object of the present invention is to propose a reflectance measurement apparatus specifically adapted for measuring skin reflectance. The apparatus comprises a probe with a casing having an aperture, a flexible fiber optics connection with at least three optical conductors secured in the casing facing the aperture in specific directions, and a measuring device with light emitting and receiving means coupled to the optical conductors. The measuring device has processing means with correcting means to compensate for variations in emitted light and ambient light influence, producing a relative reflectance signal from measured specular and diffuse reflection values.

Unlike systems with focusing lenses requiring extremely accurate positioning, this apparatus can tolerate a few degrees of deviation between the probe and skin surface.

• The invention relates to methods and apparatus for providing ventilatory assistance matched to a subject's respiratory need. The ventilatory assistance can be for subjects who are spontaneously breathing or not spontaneously breathing. The invention is especially suitable for spontaneously breathing subjects requiring long-term ventilatory assistance, particularly during sleep.

• The apparatus provides ventilatory assistance by delivering breathable gas at a pressure above atmospheric to the subject's airways. Respiratory airflow is measured and a phase in the respiratory cycle is determined. The pressure is then adjusted as a function of the determined phase to provide ventilatory assistance matched to the subject's respiratory efforts.

• The invention seeks to simultaneously achieve the goals of matching the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts, automatically adjusting the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum ventilation, and providing some immunity to the effects of sudden leaks. The phase in the respiratory cycle is determined as a continuous variable from 0 to 1 revolution. Fuzzy logic inference rules are used to determine the phase based on respiratory airflow and rate of change of airflow.

• The desired pressure is calculated as the end expiratory pressure plus a component that varies with the phase, calculated by applying a pressure waveform template function to the phase. The fuzzy logic rules for determining phase aim to identify features such as start of inspiration, peak inspiration, start of expiration, peak expiration, and expiratory pause. The pressure modulation amplitude can be adjusted to servo-control instantaneous ventilation to at least equal a target ventilation.

• Sudden changes in leak are detected and handled using a fuzzy logic algorithm, by rapidly adjusting the leak airflow time constant if the airflow is a long way from zero for a long time compared to the expected breath duration. A modified airflow is calculated by multiplying the respiratory airflow by the fuzzy negation of a ""sudden leak"" index. This reduces the effects of sudden leaks on the derived respiratory airflow signal.

• The invention is a sanitizable rotary valve for liquid chromatography and fluid handling, particularly for separating biological macromolecules in the pharmaceutical industry. The valve has a rotor with ports that align with ports on a stator to control fluid flow. A key feature is an elastomeric diaphragm seal on the rotor or stator that allows the faces to partially separate for cleaning and sanitizing the fluid-contacting surfaces without disassembly. The diaphragm has integral sealing lips to contain the cleaning fluids when the faces are separated.

• The rotor carousel connects to multiple chromatography columns or solid phase segments. The rotor is actuated to rotate and align its ports with the stator ports to direct fluid flows. Barrier channels are incorporated to flush the outer sealing areas and prevent accumulation of dried residue or environmental contamination. The actuator allows precise control of sealing force to optimize the balance between leakage and diaphragm wear.

• For sanitizing, the actuator partially separates the rotor and stator, and cleaning fluid is flushed through the barrier channels and across the sealing faces while the diaphragm lips maintain containment. This allows sanitizing the valve in place without disassembly. The diaphragm seal is formed by insert molding an elastomer onto the rotor or stator body. Different sizes of the valve are described for bench scale and pilot scale applications.

The first leg is wider than the second leg and is disposed to intercept liquid flow across the tray. The legs are mounted in slotted portions of the tray to define the orientation of the valve relative to liquid flow.

The first and second legs have flange portions engaging the tray underside to prevent valve lifting.

* The circular valve apertures have notches that receive the valve legs and prevent disc rotation relative to the tray. The smaller 1-inch diameter valves allow a higher density of 25-50 valves per square foot compared to conventional 1.5-1.875 inch valves at 12-14 valves per square foot. The efficiency is enhanced by the smaller, closely spaced directional thrust valve design.

* The invention relates to a fluid pressure regulator assembly that produces energy from fluid pressure regulation. Prior art regulators result in a loss of energy between the high-pressure fluid entering and low-pressure fluid exiting. The invention aims to convert this potential energy into work.

* The fluid pressure regulator assembly comprises a pressurized fluid source, first and second means for transporting pressurized fluid, a fluid regulator coupled to the first and second means, and means coupled between the first means and regulator for converting pressurized fluid into mechanical power. In the preferred embodiment, the converting means is a vane pump that converts pressurized fluid into movement of the vanes, which can then be converted into rotational and/or electrical energy.

* The fluid regulator defines a high-pressure cavity in fluid communication with a low-pressure cavity via an opening. A valve stem in the opening is coupled to a threaded shaft with a compressed spring and resilient diaphragm that regulate pressure in the low-pressure cavity.

* The vane motor has a casing with an inlet coupled to the high-pressure line and an outlet. Inside are an outer race, inner drum with apertures, and perpendicular first and second vane assemblies with lost motion linkages allowing extension and retraction.

* As pressurized fluid enters the inlet, it presses against the vanes, rotating the inner drum and drum shaft counterclockwise. The vanes extend and retract to maximize forward torque and minimize reverse torque on the drum.

* The drive shaft of the motor is coupled to an electrical generator that sends current to a battery powering a rotisserie on a gas grill. Fluid flows from the tank through the motor, reducing pressure, then through the regulator for further pressure reduction before reaching the grill burner.

Prior art methods for synthesizing 143a had various drawbacks such as low yields, formation of waste co-products, use of toxic/expensive reagents, and impractical regeneration times. The present invention provides a new practical process for producing 143a with very high conversion and selectivity (both over 99%) for 143a. It is based on vapor phase fluorination of 142b at a molar ratio of HF:142b in excess of 1:1 in the presence of a Cr catalyst.

• The catalyst can be unsupported or supported, used with or without a cocatalyst selected from nickel, cobalt and manganese salts. Preferred catalysts are CrF3.4H2O and Cr/Ni/AlF3, which provide high conversion rates. The catalysts were tested under severe conditions (high temperature, high HCl concentration, presence of 141b and 365) with minimal change in conversion and selectivity for 143a still >99.9%.

• Pyrazolotriazoles are useful magenta couplers for photography but are difficult to synthesize. One preferred route involves preparing triazolothiadiazines and subsequently desulfurizing them to pyrazolotriazoles in a two-step process.

• The first step is a ring contraction reaction by heating the triazolothiadiazine in acetic anhydride. The second step is hydrolysis of acetyl groups and simultaneous desulfurization with hydrochloric acid, which generates elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities.

• Using hypophosphorous acid in the second step reduces the amount of elemental sulfur and sulfur impurities formed. It results in H2S byproduct instead of sulfur, increases product yield, and does not reduce nitro groups that are commonly present.

• In a preferred embodiment, a triazolothiadiazine is reacted with an acylating agent to form an acylated intermediate, which is subsequently reacted with an aqueous mixture of hypophosphorous acid and hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid.

* The invention relates to a method and apparatus for forming fiber mixtures from different fiber bales by sequentially taking small partial quantities. In known methods, a carriage with a bale opener moves past fiber bales, taking partial quantities from each to achieve a desired mixture ratio. However, this can lead to residual fibers remaining in bales that disturb the operating rhythm and require additional processing. The known methods also only allow the mixture to be obtained in steps, preventing optimal homogeneity.

* The invention aims to eliminate these disadvantages by measuring the entire momentary quantity of each fiber bale before each pass of the bale opener. From these measurements, a partial quantity corresponding to a predetermined proportion of the momentary entire quantity is determined. This determined partial quantity is then continuously removed only from the measured fiber lot during that pass.

* In one embodiment, only the initial total quantity of each fiber bale is measured, and a constant partial quantity is calculated once. These partial quantities are then removed from the bales in succession over a fixed number of passes. This method is particularly suited for mixtures with constant quantity proportions.

* To avoid delays, the invention sets a predetermined time period for removing the partial quantities from each fiber lot. The bale opener output rate is coordinated with the processing rate of after-connected machines to prevent idle running.

* The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a two-sided nonwoven fabric exhibiting a three-dimensional image. Conventional textile fabric production is a complex, multi-step process involving carding, drawing, roving, spinning, warping, slashing, and weaving. In contrast, nonwoven fabrics can be produced more efficiently directly from the carding process. However, nonwoven fabrics have commonly been disadvantaged compared to conventional textiles in terms of resistance to elongation when both transverse and co-linear stresses are encountered.

* Hydroentangled nonwoven fabrics have been developed with improved properties by forming complex composite structures to provide necessary fabric integrity. Fabric durability has been further enhanced by applying binder compositions and/or thermal stabilization. Nonwoven composite structures typically incorporate a support layer or scrim, such as an array of polymers, metal screens, fiberglass, or vegetable fibers, to improve physical properties like elongation.

* More recently, hydroentanglement techniques have been developed to impart images or patterns to the entangled fabric using three-dimensional image transfer devices. For specific applications, a two-sided, three-dimensionally imaged nonwoven fabric must exhibit a combination of specific physical characteristics. The present invention is directed to a method of forming such a two-sided nonwoven fabric, which exhibits a pronounced three-dimensional image that is durable to both converting and end-use application.

It includes first and second cams arranged on respective sides of a projection of the bobbin housing of a rotatable hook for controlling the rotation of the bobbin housing with the rotary hook housing which includes a spring rod extending between the cams which cooperate with the projection.

* The holding means that prevent co-rotation and reverse rotation of the bobbin housing are located on the loop cast-off side of the bobbin housing, allowing the needle thread loop to expand unhindered until its maximum expansion is reached. The needle thread loop then slides along the outer surface of the bobbin housing and the front side face of the shoulder, moving through the gap between the front cam and the shoulder with only a slight bending of the low-mass spring rod.

* A capsule release device can give the bobbin housing a rotational impulse counter to the direction of hook rotation, briefly moving the rear side face of the shoulder away from the spring rod to allow the needle thread loop to slip through unhindered. This reduces the required needle thread tension to a minimum.

* Even without the capsule release device, the rotary hook has comparatively good sewing properties, as the low mass spring rod is only bent back slightly by the needle thread loop. While this results in a slightly higher needle thread tension compared to using the capsule release device, it is still lower than with conventional rotary hooks.

• The invention relates to techniques for more accurately measuring fluid pressure in geological formations at desired depths using pressure sensors. The pressure sensor inlet is isolated in the borehole using cement grout so it only measures formation pressure adjacent to the sensor, not pressures from other depths. A fluid path is opened between the sensor inlet and the formation through the cement grout to allow formation fluid pressure to reach the sensor.

• In one embodiment, a pressure transducer is lowered into a borehole to the desired depth and cement grout is pumped in. Fluid is then pumped through a conduit and check valve to the transducer inlet to clear grout and create a path to the formation before the grout fully sets. The transducer measures the formation pressure through this path while isolated from other borehole pressures by the set grout.

• In another embodiment, a conduit with a filter on the bottom end is placed in the borehole and filled with fluid. Cement grout is pumped into the borehole, then fluid is pumped through the conduit to clear the filter and create a formation path. After the grout sets, a pressure transducer is lowered into the conduit and sealed with a packer to measure formation pressure through the path.

• The borehole can optionally be fractured after grout sets by pumping high pressure fluid through the conduit and filter to extend the formation connection. A chronological pressure record during installation shows borehole and grout hydrostatic pressures, followed by a decline and recovery to formation pressure. Fluid injection can be used to maintain pressure near formation pressure during grout setting.

• The inlet filter prevents grout and debris from entering the conduit, but can be omitted in some cases with the open conduit end serving as the inlet. The transducer in the second embodiment can be removed for servicing or relocated to different depths. Pressure readings can be transmitted to surface monitoring equipment via electrical cable.

• The invention allows isolating the pressure sensor inlet to accurately measure formation pressure at a specific depth without influence from other borehole pressures. Various changes in details can be made to the pressure sensing systems and methods as engineering choices while still applying the key principles of the invention.

* The invention relates to position and motion sensors, particularly for monitoring moving parts in mechanical systems like diesel engine fuel injectors. Sensors for each moving part can be wired to a remote monitoring system, but this adds cost and weight. Reducing the amount of wiring can be achieved by having the sensor draw a current proportional to the position of the monitored object. Further wire reduction is possible by multiplexing multiple sensors on the same wires, with the monitoring system using timing information to identify which sensor signal is being sampled.

* Position sensors generate an electrical signal proportional to the distance between the moving object and a fixed point, but unwanted noise signals are also generated. Higher frequency noise can be filtered out, but low frequency noise in the form of DC offset or drift is a significant portion of the total signal. This DC offset causes problems in two-wire current output sensors by increasing power dissipation, reducing maximum operating temperature and reliability, and leaving less power for the sensor itself.

* The invention is a sensor comprising a waveform generator that modifies an unconditioned sensing signal from a transducer using an error correction signal, and an error correction generator that provides the error correction signal. The error correction generator has a comparator to determine the value of the conditioned sensing signal, a controller that provides timing signals based on this value, and a signal processor that generates the error correction signal using the timing signals. This allows the sensor to connect to remote monitoring equipment using only two wires for multiplexing multiple sensors.

* The error correction generator determines and eliminates static and error signals that do not provide position information and waste energy. It uses a closed-loop compensation circuit to constantly compare the conditioned sensing signal to a desired minimum value and generate a correction signal to subtract the offset and error, keeping the sensor output close to the minimum. The comparison proceeds slowly relative to object motion so the generated position signals are not significantly subtracted, but fast relative to the object motion so noise and errors can be deleted.

* The sensor has a window reference circuit that compares the desired conditioned sensor output to the actual output and adjusts it if outside preset high or low reference signals. The signal processor generates a small reference signal to eliminate small negative drift without generating significant calibration voltage signal, and a large reference signal exceeding the maximum sensor",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 40, 'symbol': '*'}"

The female link receives the male link to allow translation and form a radial interface that dampens the translation. A releasable pin selectively retains the male and female links.

• A gearbox assembly attaches to an engine using the link assembly. The female link receiving the male link to allow damped translation, and the releasable pin, are key technical functions of the design. The embodiments provide advantages that will become more apparent from the detailed description.

• Figures 2 and 3 show details of the mounting link, which includes a female link, male link, and pin. The mounting link rigidly constrains one degree of freedom between the engine and gearbox. Under extreme loads, the pin can shear to allow damped motion between the links to absorb shocks.

• The female link has a mounting end to couple to the engine or gearbox, and an interface end with a cavity to receive the male link. The male link also has a mounting end and an interface end received by the female link. The pin passes through holes in the links to selectively prevent their relative translation.

• The pin serves as a fusible link designed to shear at a load corresponding to the maximum structural capability of the gearbox assembly and engine mounting. After the pin shears, the links can translate relative to each other, with the radial interface providing coulomb damping to dissipate energy.

• The invention relates to a method and arrangement for compressing gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method involves compressing the gas to a higher pressure, cooling it by heat exchange, and feeding it back into the pipeline at a lower temperature and increased pressure compared to the entry conditions. During warmer periods when cooling by heat exchange alone is insufficient, the gas is compressed to an excess pressure substantially higher than the desired exit pressure, cooled by heat exchange to a temperature above the target, and then expanded to the desired exit pressure to obtain further cooling.

• The arrangement includes compressors, heat exchangers, valve-controlled pipelines connecting the components, and an electronic control system. The control operates to have at least one compressor compress the gas to an excess pressure well above the desired exit pressure. An expanding unit is provided to expand the compressed gas, with the control operating the expansion to reach the desired exit pressure.

• A preferred embodiment compresses the gas in three stages, with most compression occurring in two primary stages using machines with similar pressure ratios, allowing the compressors to be of similar construction. Cooling occurs between the primary stages and after the second stage by air/gas heat exchange. The final excess pressure is reached in an additional booster compressor stage, after which the gas is again cooled and then expanded in a turbine that drives the booster compressor.

• The ability to exchange compressors between stages is advantageous to adapt to seasonal changes in flow rate, pressure requirements, and cooling conditions. In the cold season, compression in a single primary stage is sufficient for cooling, so the second stage compressors can be operated in parallel with the first stage at the same pressure to provide the required flow. Having multiple compressors in each stage with some as standbys allows flexibility to handle breakdowns and maintenance.

• In summer operation, after purification, the gas is compressed in the first primary stage, cooled, compressed in the second primary stage, compressed to excess pressure in the booster stage, cooled again, and finally expanded in turbines to the desired exit pressure, recovering energy to help drive the booster compressors.

* Spacecraft structures require lightweight composite materials, but these have little inherent damping, subjecting instruments to high vibration levels. Efforts are being made to modify graphite structures to lower vibration response, but additional vibration reduction techniques for instruments may be needed. Instruments are typically mounted on precision kinematic mounts which have little damping, accentuating vibration issues.

* Conventional kinematic mount designs have met with limited success in minimizing loads transmitted to instruments. The mounts are designed to carry launch loads but have no provisions to minimize loads. The six suspension modes introduced by the mounts are expected to have very little damping, amplifying flight loads.

* Objects of the invention include providing kinematic mounts with damping features and passive energy dissipation to protect instruments. Additional objects are to provide mounts that can be incorporated on existing structures, use six identical elements to reduce manufacturing complexity, rearrange the configuration to uncouple suspension modes, and achieve modal damping values 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than existing designs.

The metric provides a weighted sum of the missing and extra volume elements, with the weighting based on each element's distance from the closest common element. This accounts for the clinical significance of errors with respect to the resolution limits of radiation therapy.

• The present invention relates to an improved data processing system and apparatus for accelerating floating point operations, particularly the effective subtraction operation. Floating point numbers are represented by a fraction value and an exponent argument value, and addition/subtraction operations are more complex due to the need to align fractions and potentially normalize the result. The effective subtraction operation includes addition of operands with differing signs and subtraction of operands with the same sign.

• The related art performs effective subtraction by determining the exponent difference, aligning the smaller operand, subtracting, taking the 2's complement if negative, finding the leading 1, normalizing, and rounding - a total of 7 time-consuming steps. The present invention accelerates this by considering two cases based on whether the absolute exponent difference is ≤1 or >1. When the difference is >1, the larger operand is known, avoiding the need for negation, and normalization/rounding can be combined into one step.

• When the exponent difference is ≤1, alignment can be done ""on the fly"" during subtraction, and either normalization or rounding (but not both) are needed, reducing the 7 steps to 5. Further acceleration is achieved by beginning the subtraction based on the difference between a subset of the least significant bits of the exponents, before the full exponent difference is calculated. The subset size is chosen such that if the full difference implies a different result, the correct result will simply be one of the original operand fractions.

• For example, if the 6-bit difference TDELTA(E) is 0, the computation of FRACTION A - FRACTION B begins. If the full difference DELTA(E) is 0 this is correct; if DELTA(E) ≥ 64 the result is FRACTION A; if DELTA(E) ≤ -64 the result is FRACTION B. Similar logic applies for TDELTA(E) of 1 or -1.

* The passage describes a system and method for performing design rule checks (DRC) on integrated circuits (ICs) with both logic and memory regions. Conventional DRC methods apply the same logic rules to the entire IC layout, resulting in many false errors in memory regions which have different design rules. The invention solves this by applying different design rule checks to the logic regions and the various memory regions (SRAM, DRAM, ROM, etc.). This eliminates false errors and allows the different regions to be checked according to their specific design rules.

* To implement the invention, the IC layout is divided into logic and memory regions, with each memory region further identified by a memory type. Logic design rules are applied to the logic regions, while customized design rules are applied to each type of memory region. The customized memory design rules are derived by modifying the logic design rules based on the actual design rules for each type of memory cell.

* The customized memory design rules are created by first performing a design rule check on a memory cell layout using the standard logic rules. This check will flag violations of the logic rules by the memory cell. These violations are then analyzed to determine how the logic design rules should be modified to accommodate the memory cell's actual design rules. The modified logic rules, with more liberal parameter values ""pushed"" onto them, become the customized design rules for that memory type.

* By applying the appropriate set of design rules to each region of the IC layout, the system avoids false errors and provides a more efficient and reliable design rule check. The result is a design rule check report with real logic and memory errors clearly distinguished. This allows circuit designs to be implemented in silicon more quickly. The method can be extended to any type of IC with mixed circuit types having different design rules.

• This invention pertains to using waveguide holograms as illuminators for objects with specific illumination requirements, such as display holograms or spatial light modulators. The illumination system comprises a thin substrate waveguide optically coupled to a coherent light source like a laser.

• Waveguide holograms (WGHs) are flat and can be optically contacted to the objects they illuminate, providing a compact and rugged arrangement compared to conventional lens systems. WGHs can achieve very high diffraction efficiency approaching 0.99, and the undiffracted light is trapped in the waveguide, resulting in an efficiency ratio E≥0.999.

• Some challenges with WGHs include critical alignment of laser beams, time delay across the hologram, and nonuniformity of the diffracted wavefront along the propagation direction. Illumination depletion occurs as light is diffracted out of the waveguide at each point, making the reconstructed image nonuniform if the hologram is recorded uniformly.

• Illumination depletion can be compensated for a priori by recording the hologram nonuniformly so the reconstructed beam is uniform, or a posteriori by exposing a photographic negative to absorb more light where the beam is brightest. WGHs also tend to produce two diffracted beams, one out of each side, which can be addressed by absorbing or reflecting the unutilized beam.

• Alignment sensitivity can be combatted by firmly attaching the light source to the waveguide or using a broad source and allowing the waveguide to select the properly matched light. WGHs can achieve high spectral selectivity of about 2-5 Å due to double selection by the hologram and waveguide.

• When illuminating SLMs, polarized light can be diffracted out and the SLM used to modulate polarization, with analyzers controlling the unmodulated light. Precise reflective systems using phase modulation can cause selective interference between the emitted and reflected beams.

• Two basic architectures were used to record the WGH grating: a modified conventional holographic recording system with a cubic glass prism to create a steep reference beam",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

Smart cards containing an IC chip are well known and have been used for credit card and ATM transactions. Typically, smart cards are made with a rigid core onto which the electronic components are secured by glue or mechanical means, and then covered with a plastic.

* Several prior art methods for making smart cards are discussed, including inserting an antenna into a recess in a carrier body, using low shrinkage glue to secure components to a rigid plastic core layer which is placed into a mold assembly into which thermoplastic is injected, and a process using core sheets of PVC, polyester or ABS where a region is milled to expose the contacts of the card. The prior art cards can be subject to damage from bending stresses, and securing the electronic components with glue or mechanical means is complicated and increases production costs.

* The invention relates to implementing a queue, particularly a FIFO queue, in a functional memory where updates are made by copying the path from the root to the point of updating and making the update in the copy. The queue is implemented and maintained using a tree-shaped structure with nodes of a given maximum size. Additions are directed to the first non-full node on the first edge of the tree, while deletions are directed to a leaf node on the opposite edge.

* The tree-shaped structure maintains the leaf nodes at the same hierarchy level by creating new nodes when a non-full node is not present during additions. This allows each update to require time and space logarithmically dependent on the queue length, as only the path from the root to the update point needs to be copied. The node to be updated is easily accessed by following the edge of the tree until a leaf node is found.

* A preferred embodiment includes a separate header node with three elements pointing to nodes constituting the end, middle (the tree-shaped structure), and beginning of the queue. Additions fill the end node first before adding to the tree, while deletions remove an entire leaf node from the tree and make it the beginning node. This reduces the need to update the tree for every addition or deletion.

* The queue is symmetrical and can be inverted in constant time and space by using an identifier in the header node to indicate which separate nodes are the beginning and end. Changing the identifier's value interprets the queue in the opposite direction and the tree structure as a mirror image. This allows the queue to be used as a double-ended queue (deque).

This process is repeated for different feedback gain values. Finally, the feedback gain value that provides a suitable evaluation value is calculated based on the relationship between the feedback gain values and evaluation values.

* The invention relates to electron multipliers used in photomultipliers and particle detectors such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates. Conventional electron multipliers include discrete dynode multipliers and continuous electron multipliers. Discrete dynode multipliers consist of dynode stages that initiate and amplify a cascade of electrons, while continuous electron multipliers employ high resistivity glass channels or tubes that act as a series of continuous dynodes. The gain of these conventional electron multipliers can be modeled using equations based on the number of stages and secondary electron emission yield.

* A foil electron multiplier encompasses the next generation design of electron multipliers. It uses a series of extremely thin, in-line foils to create secondary electrons. The in-line orientation and thinness of the foils allows incident primary particles and generated secondary electrons to continue to the next foils, creating a larger avalanche of electrons compared to historical designs. This design also enables obtaining position-sensitive information on where an incident particle impacted the first stage.

* Advantages of the foil electron multiplier design include higher gain per multiplication stage, simplicity and lower cost of fabrication compared to microchannel plates, ability to cover a larger area, and intrinsic rejection of ion feedback at each stage. The foil electron multiplier comprises a series of thin foils held in an evacuated enclosure that form discrete multiplication stages.

• The invention relates to methods for transferring network administrative functions from a master device to a slave device in order to manage power consumption in a network. The master device, which performs network administrative functions while in an active power state, sends data to a slave device to enable the slave device to start performing the administrative functions. The master device then enters a lower power consumption state.

• In a home network, devices are communicatively coupled and capable of serving as master or slave nodes. The master node controls data transmission and instructs slave nodes, while slave nodes must request bandwidth from the master to stream data. Devices have sufficient processing power and memory to perform administrative functions.

• When instructed to enter a power-saving mode, the master node determines if there is network traffic. If so, it sends a transfer request to slave nodes, waits for replies, selects a slave node if multiple reply, and transfers administrative functions to the selected slave node before entering power-saving mode. Selection criteria can be based on visibility, intelligence/capabilities, or user preference.

• The administrative functions are transferred to the slave node while it performs its own functions, intermittently, or after completing its own functions. This allows the master to enter a low-power state while ensuring administrative functions continue via the new master. The process occurs quickly, within tens of milliseconds.

• From the slave node perspective, upon receiving a transfer request, the slave determines if it's in power-saving mode. If not, it sends an acceptance reply to the master. If selected by the master, it receives the transferred administrative functions and becomes the new master.

• When any device joins the network, it checks for beacons. If none are found, it concludes there is no master, becomes the master itself, generates necessary administrative information, and performs both administrative and its own functions. If beacons are found, it simply joins as a slave node.

Low elevation angles are difficult to measure due to interference from ground reflections. A unique equi-spaced triplet arrangement of antenna elements, placed orthogonal to a reflecting ground plane, can determine elevation angle independent of the unknown ground reflection coefficient.

• The prior art uses a single equi-spaced triplet, where the quotient of the R.F. outputs (A+C) and B is independent of transmitted power, range, antenna height, and ground reflection coefficient. At low elevation angles, the signal amplitude S simplifies and the antenna height h can be chosen to maximize S. Elevation angle can only be measured when S is non-zero and changing slowly near its maximum value.

• The invention aims to overcome ambiguity in angle measurement by using at least four antennas providing at least two equi-spaced linear triplets perpendicular to a ground plane. Radio receivers obtain information signals from each antenna, and logic circuits combine the signals to derive quotient signals for each triplet that are functions of elevation angle but not ground reflection. Selection means provide the quotient signal(s) that best measure the elevation angle.

• The array can operate in receive mode, where angle measurement is provided by the antenna receiver signal processing, or in transmit mode, where each antenna's transmitted signal must be coded to derive a quotient representing angle at a remote receiver.

Current practices use a ceramic adhesive between the glass envelope and a metal support sleeve, which has several problems.

• The adhesive breaks down from thermal cycling between the lamp's high operating temperature and room temperature, which can be as high as 300°C. The different thermal expansion coefficients of the glass envelope and metal sleeve cause destructive shear.

* The invention provides a receiver input circuit that substantially eliminates undesired signal actuation of non-linear components resulting in distortions. It uses conventional components while taking into account adequate small signal behavior.

* The circuit includes several amplification control loops, with control signals derived from different stages. The first and second control loops within the input circuit avoid overloading of the mixer stage and varactor diodes.

* A third control loop can support the other loops with a lower effective bandwidth and signal response threshold. Its response threshold may be controlled by the second loop's control signal to lower amplification even for small signals in the presence of strong spurious signals.

* Further embodiments include extended input networks with additional PIN diodes and reactances for greater control range and selectivity. During control, the source impedance for the preamplifier transistor increases, amplifying the control effect through increased negative current feedback without substantially raising noise.

* This invention is a downconverting digitizer that converts a modulated intermediate frequency (IF) signal to a digital representation of the baseband in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. It utilizes predictive coding principles by placing a sampler inside a predictive loop, allowing the predictive loop filter to be implemented using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.

* The predictive filter output is re-mapped into the analog domain using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and subtracted from the input analog signal to generate the prediction error signal. The dynamic range is extended by using the digital output of the loop to control a variable gain amplifier at the input, and DC offset performance is enhanced through an offset nulling digital signal processing element.

* The sampler converts the loop error signal from analog to digital representation, and the predictive filter generates a prediction of the modulated IF at the next sampling epoch. The digital implementation of the predictive filter allows its frequency response to be reprogrammed to match the input signal.

* An automatic gain control (AGC) loop maintains the amplitude of the modulated IF signal within the dynamic range of the predictive loop. The offset nuller loop dynamically determines and removes offsets that would otherwise impair the analog-to-digital conversion.

* A digital quadrature mixer (DQM) downconverts the output of the predictive filter to baseband I and Q components, and rate reduction filters perform filtering and sample rate reduction on these components. The invention was implemented and verified as part of a wireless telephone receiver using a 0.6 micron CMOS semiconductor process.

The nanotraces provide high sensitivity detection due to their small dimensions and large surface-to-volume ratio.

* The fabrication process involves depositing and patterning gate, source, and drain electrodes on a substrate, followed by nanoimprint lithography to create a set of parallel semiconductor nanotraces across the interdigitated source and drain electrodes of each sensor. A template with nanoscale grooves is pressed into a resist layer on the device stack, which is then etched to transfer the pattern into the underlying semiconductor layer.

The invention also provides apparatus and tooling to enable the fabrication, as well as the resultant sub-assemblies and assemblies themselves.

* The process uses prepared decals with registration holes and a release agent coating. Electrodes are screen printed onto the decals in a desired pattern. Electrical component material is then deposited onto part of each electrode and the decal to produce laminate sub-assemblies.

* The sub-assemblies are brought into stacked relation by displacing the decals for precision registration and removing the decals. No large laminating force is required because the electrodes are flush with the component surfaces, preventing density distortions that previously led to delamination problems. The stacks are placed on setters for drying and firing.

This allows the enhanced radio telephone to selectively operate as either a conventional radio telephone or as an IP telephone. The enhanced radio telephone includes an internal low-power speech coder, enabling it to work with a low-performance PC for effective IP telephony at reduced cost and speech delay compared to conventional IP telephones.

* In exemplary embodiments, the enhanced radio handset connects to a PC serial or parallel port via a cable, or wirelessly via infrared or short-range radio, to exchange coded compressed digital speech signals. The PC performs conversions between the coded speech and the appropriate computer network protocol. This allows the PC to be a low-end desktop, laptop, notebook or palm-top computer since it does not need to perform speech coding and decoding.

Switching between ordinary wireless operation and IP-telephone operation is done manually via the radio handset or automatically from the PC telephony application. Calls can be initiated using either the PC telephony application or the keypad on the enhanced radio telephone.

Coded speech passes from the enhanced radio telephone to the PC where it is formatted into IP speech and passed back to the enhanced radio telephone for wireless transmission to the computer network. This IP data transfer uses either a separate or the same connection on the enhanced radio telephone as that used for coded speech and control signaling.

• The invention relates to scraped surface heat exchangers, specifically the mounting of blades onto the central drive shaft. In a known method, blades are hingedly connected to the drive shaft using welded pins with narrow and wide fingers that the blade slides between. The blade has holes that the inner finger protrudes through to restrain lateral movement while allowing angular movement. Typically, two or more hinged pin connections are used per blade.

• During installation of the drive shaft into the heat exchanger tube, the blades need to remain at a shallow angle so the fingers protrude through the holes, retaining the blades in place. This can be cumbersome, requiring tying strings or manually holding blades, especially for long vertical heat exchangers. If blades swing out to the installation angle, they can slide off the pins since the inner finger is not restraining them through the hole. This is problematic for large vertical heat exchangers where blades can fall freely if not restrained.

• The present invention facilitates mounting blades onto drive shafts using pin connections. A blade according to the invention has a blade body with first and second sides, a scraper edge, a hinge edge, and at least one mounting hole near the hinge edge. It has first and second L-shaped locking tracks protruding into the first and second sides respectively. Each track has an entry track extending from the hinge edge and an intermediate track extending from the entry track to the mounting hole, with the second intermediate track extending past the hole.

* The invention relates to detecting and eliminating defective or incorrectly positioned cigarettes in the magazine of a cigarette production or packaging machine. Cigarettes can end up positioned transversely, blocking shafts beneath the storage part. Removing such disruptions is laborious and costly, often requiring the machine to be switched off. An operator usually watches the magazine and manually removes transverse cigarettes, but human error is a risk.

* The detection process uses an optical checking element to scan an image of multiple cigarettes in the magazine. The image is evaluated by an image-processing device. If the scanned image deviates from a reference image or value, an error signal is produced. This allows detecting transversely located as well as defective cigarettes.

* The elimination process detects a defective or incorrectly positioned cigarette and actuates an ejecting unit to eject multiple cigarettes in an assigned ejecting zone. Multiple adjacent ejecting zones and units are preferably provided so the entire magazine width need not be ejected. The ejecting unit front and rear walls differ in size and contour to avoid jamming partially gripped cigarettes.

* A cigarette magazine has a storage part and shaft groups beneath. Cigarettes should be parallel, horizontal, and aligned at the ends. Gravity moves cigarettes down to the shaft groups. Oscillating rods ensure uniform downward movement.

Most highway, transit, and safety funds are distributed through formulas that do not link to performance or needs. The programs often do not use the best tools or approaches, and their fiscal sustainability is in doubt due to increased spending without commensurate revenue increases.

* To address these issues, surface transportation programs should be restructured based on several key principles. Programs should have well-defined goals based on identified areas of national interest and a clearly defined federal role. Performance and accountability should be incorporated into funding decisions, and the best tools and approaches should be used to improve results and return on investment.

* Potential options to fund increased infrastructure investment include altering existing taxes and fees or introducing new ones. Examples include increasing fuel taxes, indexing fuel taxes to inflation, implementing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) fees, freight fees, or congestion pricing. Financing mechanisms such as bonds, loans, and public-private partnerships can also provide flexibility and leverage additional nonfederal investment.

* Highway public-private partnerships show promise but also entail potential costs and risks. More consistent, rigorous analysis of public interest considerations is needed when evaluating these partnerships. The federal government should develop objective criteria for identifying national interests in highway public-private partnerships.

* The Comanche helicopter program was established in 1983 to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet with an advanced technology, low-cost, lightweight helicopter. Critical to achieving the program's goals are the successful development of advanced technologies such as composite materials, avionics, propulsion systems, and software. The program must also meet ambitious maintainability goals to realize significantly lower operating and support costs and achieve a wartime operational availability of 6 hours per day. In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the program, reducing funding and extending the development phase by 3 years.

* The Army's restructuring continues risks of making production decisions before the aircraft's performance is validated and of higher program costs. According to DOD guidelines, programs with high concurrency that proceed to low-rate production before completing operational testing risk costly retrofits and design changes. The restructured program delays operational testing until after production decisions are made, and the Army plans to buy six ""early operational capability"" aircraft estimated to cost over $300 million. The Army has an opportunity to reduce concurrency risks by completing operational testing before committing to production.

* The Comanche's estimated program acquisition unit cost has increased 185% since 1985, from $12.1 million to $34.4 million per aircraft, while planned acquisition quantities decreased from 5,023 to 1,292 aircraft. The Secretary's restructuring decision and the Army's plan extend development by about 3 years and increase the risk of higher total program and unit costs. There is concern that deferring additional development efforts to 2002 and beyond may increase the risk that needed funds will not be available. Uncertainties in software development and aircraft maintainability also increase the risk that the aircraft will not perform successfully.

* The Comanche will be the most software-intensive Army helicopter ever built, with 1.4 million lines of code for critical functions and over 2.7 million lines total. Almost all the software will be written in Ada, but problems exist with the Ada compilation system, software development and testing delays are occurring, and improvements are needed in configuration management. These issues could degrade the aircraft's performance and capability and delay first flight.

• The Food Stamp Program provides eligible low-income households with benefits to purchase food. FNS funds the benefits and half of states' administrative costs, and sets regulations for the program. FNS recently introduced options and waivers to increase access, reduce reporting burdens, and minimize payment errors.

• To be eligible, a household's gross income cannot exceed 130% of the poverty level and assets cannot exceed $2,000. Recipients of TANF cash assistance are automatically eligible for food stamps. States can extend categorical eligibility to families receiving other TANF-funded services or benefits.

• Households are certified eligible for 1-24 months and must report changes in circumstances that affect eligibility or benefit amounts. States determine household reporting frequency and can require monthly reports or change reporting as changes occur. FNS offers quarterly and semiannual reporting options and waivers to reduce reporting burdens.

• FNS monitors states' payment error rates, which averaged 8.9% in 2000, through a quality control system. Overpayments and underpayments occur due to caseworker and recipient errors, often related to determining household income. States usually certify households with earnings for shorter periods and require more frequent reporting to minimize errors.

• States have used options and waivers to change eligibility determination, such as conferring categorical eligibility to households receiving TANF-funded services, exempting vehicles from asset calculations, and reducing reporting requirements. While these changes aimed to increase access and simplify administration, some states found them cumbersome or had concerns about payment errors. Additional changes to vehicle rules, reporting requirements, and the quality control system were suggested.

* Ground ambulance services are provided by a variety of organizations that differ in structure, staffing, types of transports offered, and revenue sources. Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule with a service-level payment for the type of transport and a mileage payment. Providers' costs per transport in 2010 were highly variable, ranging from $224 to $2,204, with a median of $429, reflecting differences in provider characteristics like transport volume, Medicare transport mix, and government subsidies. Personnel costs accounted for the largest portion of total costs and contributed most to cost increases from 2009 to 2010.

* The estimated median Medicare margin in 2010 was 2% with add-on payments, but -1% without them. From 2004 to 2010, ambulance transports for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries increased 33% nationally, with the largest increase in super-rural areas at 41%. The increase was primarily due to a 59% rise in BLS nonemergency transports, with super-rural areas seeing the biggest jump at 82%. Factors like age, race, and sex of beneficiaries remained stable during this period.

* Increased billing for Medicare ambulance services by local governments facing budgetary pressures and the introduction of the national fee schedule in 2002 may have contributed to the rise in transports. The HHS OIG has cited improper payments, particularly for nonemergency dialysis transports, and transports not meeting Medicare requirements as potential causes for the increase in utilization.

DOD policy requires SRC I ammunition to be tracked by serial number and have a higher level of protection and security. The military services have several automated information systems for managing accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition.

• The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that while the military services generally maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition, there were gaps in some service-level guidance and procedures. The Air Force does not track SRC I ammunition by serial number and its procedures have not maintained accountability for items owned by other services. The Army and Marine Corps do not have guidance specifying timeframes for receipting shipments of SRC I ammunition.

• The military services generally recorded shipment and receipt of SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems, but the Army's processes do not provide full accountability for in-transit items. The military services have not consistently ensured timely, complete, and accurate information to maintain full visibility of SRC I ammunition. The Army has not ensured timely and complete information of SRC I ammunition returned to contractors, and had inaccurately categorized some SRC I rockets.

• GAO made six recommendations to DOD to enhance policies and procedures and improve accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition. These included the Air Force revising guidance to maintain accountability of all SRC I items regardless of ownership, the Army and Marine Corps implementing guidance on timeframes for receipting ammunition, the Army evaluating actions to retain accountability of in-transit items, and the military services collaborating to ensure timely and accurate data entry into tracking systems.

• In prior reports dating back to 1994, GAO has identified issues with DOD's management of SRC I ammunition, including discrepancies in quantities and serial numbers, lack of systems to track missiles by serial number, and non-compliance with physical security requirements. Most of GAO's past recommendations have been implemented by DOD, but some remain open, such as incorporating certain missile data into Army inventory reports to provide full transparency of available ammunition.

• SSA maintains that its restrictive disclosure policy is necessary to protect the highly personal information it collects and to uphold the pledge of confidentiality made when the data was first obtained. SSA seldom has records useful to law enforcement, cannot disclose tax return information, and believes its resources should not be diverted for non-program purposes.

• Evidence suggests some SSA field office staff are confused about the disclosure policy, resulting in inconsistent application where information is sometimes inappropriately withheld from or provided to law enforcement. SSA takes steps to ensure consistent policy application, but the lack of aggregated data on disclosure requests and responses prevents assessment of overall consistency.

• The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 establishes policies for managing hazardous waste to minimize threats to human health and the environment. RCRA governs hazardous waste from generation to disposal, including waste from current and past industrial operations and cleanups.

• Three RCRA requirements - land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and permit requirements - can increase costs and delays for cleanups. These requirements can lead parties to choose less aggressive cleanup remedies that may be less protective.

• Land disposal restrictions prohibit disposing hazardous waste on land unless it is treated to meet stringent standards, which can be costly for large volumes of lightly contaminated waste. The restrictions may drive parties to use more expensive cleanup technologies than necessary.

• Minimum technological requirements establish design and operating specifications for hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities. These requirements, designed for waste from ongoing industrial operations, may be more stringent than necessary for some lower-risk remediation waste.

• RCRA generally requires a permit for treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous waste. The permit process can be costly and time-consuming, especially for facilities that only need a permit for cleanup activities.

• To avoid triggering RCRA requirements, property owners may choose to let waste remain in place without treatment. Leaving high-concentration ""old waste"" in place may pose health or environmental risks.

• Since the late 1980s, EPA has modified RCRA's application to remediation waste through policy statements and regulatory alternatives. While these have provided some flexibility, states have found the alternatives burdensome to use.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) established MIP in 1997 to provide dedicated funding for Medicare program integrity activities. MIP funds are used to enter into contracts to promote Medicare program integrity through activities like audits, medical review of claims, and investigating potential fraud cases.

* CMS allocates MIP funds to contractors to perform five main program integrity activities: audits, medical review, secondary payer, benefit integrity, and provider education. From 1997 to 2005, CMS increased funding for each activity, with provider education receiving the largest percentage increase at 590% and audit and medical review receiving the largest amounts overall. CMS spent the largest share of funds on audit (31% on average) and medical review (27% on average).

* CMS's approach to allocating MIP funds is based predominantly on historical funding levels rather than effectiveness data. CMS does not have a means to compare the relative effectiveness of most MIP activities that it could use in allocating funds. However, CMS is developing initiatives to provide objective measures of the results of the audit and provider education activities.

* After allocating MIP funds to the five activities, CMS must further distribute those funds to contractors, but has not always done so optimally based on vulnerabilities, workload, and effectiveness. For example, a contractor handling claims in high-risk fraud areas received less medical review funding per claim than contractors in lower-risk regions. However, CMS has used relative savings information to allocate funds within the secondary payer activity.

* Medicare payment method changes have significantly altered the audit focus to items affecting payments under prospective payment systems, which can impact a much smaller portion of payments compared to the previous cost-based reimbursement method. CMS has not evaluated whether audit funds should be reallocated to potentially generate greater savings by addressing the accuracy of reported costs used to determine payment increases.

While the sample focused on use of those techniques rather than workpaper adequacy, the review identified several cases where workpapers did not meet IRS' standard. Follow-up discussions were held with IRS officials about workpaper and supervisory review requirements.

• IRS' workpaper standard requires workpapers to support the auditor's conclusions, document procedures and tests, be clear and organized, ensure adjustments agree across forms, adequately document audit activity, and protect taxpayer privacy. The authors found examples of adjustments not agreeing between workpapers and reports, missing or incomplete documents, and illegible or incomplete workpapers. EQMS evaluations from 1992-1997 indicated auditors met all workpaper standard elements in no more than 72% of audits.

• Workpapers are important for formulating and documenting the auditor's findings, conclusions and recommended adjustments. They are used by reviewers as quality control and measurement tools. Inadequate workpapers may result in more work for the auditor or overturning of recommended adjustments.

• IRS requires supervisory review of audit work to assess quality and ensure standards are met, but does not require documentation of the review in audit files. The authors found little documentation of supervisory workpaper review before sharing results with taxpayers in the sampled audits. Assuming all unagreed audits were reviewed increased the estimate of reviewed audits to 26%.

• IRS officials noted other ways supervisors monitor audits besides workpaper review, such as performance evaluations, inventory discussions, time charge reviews, and approval of audit expansions",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities and allows for reorganization or liquidation of companies under judicial bankruptcy processes. Large financial companies generally file under Chapter 11, though certain financial institutions like insured depository institutions and insurance companies cannot file under the Bankruptcy Code and face special restrictions.

* The Dodd-Frank Act established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) which gives FDIC authority to resolve large financial companies outside of bankruptcy if their failure would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability. In 2013, FDIC proposed a Single Point of Entry approach under OLA to resolve a financial company at the parent holding company level while subsidiaries remain operational.

* Resolving globally active large financial firms is associated with complex international legal challenges as insolvency laws vary across countries. The U.S. adopted Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code based on the UNCITRAL Model Law to promote coordination in cross-border insolvencies.

* Two bills were introduced in the 113th Congress to address challenges with reorganizing large financial firms under Chapter 11, including establishing a new Chapter 14 and Subchapter V under Chapter 11. Neither bill was signed into law or re-introduced in the current Congress as of March 2015.

* The bills contained provisions that would have affected the role of regulators, treatment of qualified financial contracts (QFCs), and designation of bankruptcy judges. Some provisions resembled those in OLA and may have facilitated a resolution strategy similar to FDIC's Single Point of Entry approach.

* A third proposal would have repealed the safe harbor provisions for QFCs, which some experts identified as a challenge to orderly resolution in bankruptcy. However, others argue repealing the safe harbors could have adverse effects and cause a systemic crisis.

* While structural challenges remain, regulatory actions are being taken to facilitate orderly cross-border resolutions, including FDIC and Federal Reserve requiring certain financial companies to submit resolution plans.

* The electricity industry consists of four functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. The industry is becoming increasingly reliant on information technology (IT) systems and networks, which enable a smart grid that is more reliable, efficient, and facilitates renewable energy.
* The federal government and state governments have authority for overseeing the electricity industry, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), state public utility commissions, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 required the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to coordinate development of smart grid standards and guidelines.
* Threats to the electricity industry's transmission and distribution systems are evolving and growing, and can come from unintentional or intentional sources. The increased reliance on IT systems and networks exposes the electric grid to potential and known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
* Multiple entities have taken steps to help secure the electricity grid, including NERC developing critical infrastructure protection standards, NIST identifying cybersecurity standards for smart grid systems, and FERC reviewing and approving NERC's standards. The Departments of Homeland Security and Energy have also provided cybersecurity support and guidance to the electricity subsector.
* Key challenges in securing the electricity grid include monitoring implementation of cybersecurity standards, clarifying regulatory responsibilities, taking a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring smart grid systems have built-in security features, effectively sharing cybersecurity information, and establishing metrics for evaluating cybersecurity. GAO made recommendations to FERC in 2011 to address these challenges.
* FERC has taken some actions to address cybersecurity challenges, such as evaluating its existing authority, directing NERC to revise critical infrastructure protection standards, holding a technical conference, and establishing an Office of Energy Infrastructure Security.

• The federal workforce faces mission-critical skills gaps that impede the government from cost-effectively serving the public and achieving results. These gaps can be due to an insufficient number of people or a lack of appropriate skills, and are threatened by budget pressures, changing federal work, and potential retirements. According to OPM data, over 34 percent of federal employees will be eligible to retire by 2020.

• Problems exist across federal personnel systems and functions, including an outdated classification system, inflexible recruiting and hiring processes, an outmoded pay system, challenges with performance management, and a need for improved employee engagement. The federal pay system does not align well with modern compensation principles and a key challenge is balancing the size and composition of the federal workforce to deliver high quality services within budgetary realities. Congress has provided some agencies with exemptions from the current pay system to give more flexibility in setting pay.

• Lessons learned from public, private, and nonprofit organizations' experiences with market-based and performance-oriented pay systems can inform federal efforts, such as focusing on values and objectives, examining total compensation, building in safeguards for fairness, devolving decision-making, providing training, building consensus, and monitoring and refining implementation. While statutory changes may be needed in some cases, many improvements are within agencies' control, and Congress has provided agencies with tools and flexibilities to build and maintain a high-performing workforce. Agencies should make effective use of these tools and be held accountable by Congress for doing so.

* The majority of costs for the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) fall under military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts. Military personnel funds cover pay and allowances for mobilized reservists and special payments for active duty personnel, while operation and maintenance funds are used for transportation, operating support, intelligence, communications, and logistics. Estimating the cost of ongoing military operations is difficult because operational requirements can differ from budget estimates.

* In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the military services received about $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion respectively in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses. The services also received GWOT funds through their annual appropriations, but DOD and the services lost visibility over how much of these annual funds were used to support GWOT. DOD's accounting systems do not separately identify GWOT funds provided through annual appropriations.

* In addition to GWOT supplemental appropriations, beginning in fiscal year 2003 the administration increased DOD's annual budget request by over $10 billion per year to support GWOT, as outlined in Program Budget Decision 736. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the Army, Air Force and Navy received a total of about $7.9 billion and $7.6 billion respectively in their annual appropriations described as supporting GWOT. However, once allocated to the services' appropriations accounts, DOD lost visibility over these additional annual funds and cannot document what portion was actually used for GWOT.

The Army and Air Force had more than sufficient military personnel supplemental appropriations, which they used to cover operation and maintenance expenses. However, each service reported operation and maintenance obligations exceeding supplemental appropriations.

* To cover fiscal year 2004 funding gaps between GWOT obligations and supplemental appropriations, DOD and the services transferred funds, used working capital fund cash balances, and reduced or deferred planned spending for peacetime activities.

* The financial crisis prompted extraordinary government interventions to stabilize the financial system, even though these actions raised concerns about moral hazard and taxpayer expense. The initial observable policy responses included foreclosure prevention, Federal Reserve lending facilities, and currency swap arrangements, followed by actions to address issues at specific institutions. The passage of EESA and authorization of TARP provided Treasury with a framework for a more comprehensive and coordinated course of action that resulted in several programs.

* As the economy begins to recover, the federal government has begun to move into the exit phase of its financial stabilization initiatives. The winding down of government support is made more pressing by the need to exit market distorting interventions quickly and to begin shifting focus to stabilizing the government debt-to-GDP ratio. GAO made recommendations in October 2009 that any decision to extend TARP be made in coordination with relevant policymakers and that Treasury make use of quantitative analysis to support its rationale.

* On December 9, 2009, the Treasury Secretary announced the extension of TARP to October 3, 2010, with new commitments limited to foreclosure mitigation and small business lending programs. Treasury expects TARP to ultimately cost taxpayers $105.4 billion, more than $200 billion less than initially estimated. The decision to extend TARP followed months of deliberation at Treasury, and Treasury consulted with the Federal Reserve and FDIC in the process.

* Treasury considered a number of qualitative and quantitative factors in deciding to extend TARP, including ongoing weaknesses in housing markets and tight credit conditions for small businesses. Treasury ended broad programs to improve bank solvency based on banks' renewed ability to access private capital markets. Treasury also decided not to extend TALF based on the attractiveness of the program to investors as market conditions improved.

* Treasury reduced the amount available for PPIP based on improvements in prices for certain legacy assets. Treasury has yet to set explicit objectives for its small business lending programs, which raises questions about when Treasury will know that government assistance can be removed.

* The baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, will soon begin moving from working ages to retirement ages. By 2030, the aged dependency ratio, the ratio of working age population to those over 65, will reach 35%, meaning fewer than 3 workers for every retiree. This is due to both the growing number of older persons and the slowing growth of the younger labor force.

* Several recent changes to Social Security aim to strengthen incentives for working longer, such as eliminating the reduction in benefits for working past normal retirement age. Federal laws like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act also attempt to make work more hospitable for older individuals. However, some pension plan features still encourage retirement at or before 65.

* The number of older workers will grow substantially over the next two decades, becoming an increasingly significant proportion of the workforce. Older workers are employed in diverse occupations but are a growing proportion of white-collar occupations. Projections show older workers may make relatively greater earnings gains than younger counterparts between 2000 and 2008.

• State child welfare systems are complex networks designed to protect children, but their ability to meet the needs of troubled children and families has been strained by growing foster care caseloads. From 1984 to 1995, the foster care population grew from 276,000 to 494,000 children. The federal government plays an important role in financing foster care and establishing minimum procedural requirements for the placement process.

• Federal law requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent removing children from their homes, provide services to reunite families if a child is removed, and find permanent placements for children who cannot be reunited with their families. Each foster child must have a case plan that is reviewed every 6 months, with a permanency hearing held within 18 months to determine the child's future status. Twenty-six states have enacted laws or policies to shorten the time to the first permanency hearing to less than 18 months.

• Although states generally did not systematically evaluate the impacts of their initiatives, they implemented various changes to expedite and improve the permanency process, such as reuniting children with families more quickly, expediting termination of parental rights when reunification is not feasible, and reducing the number of different foster care placements children experience. Some states implemented low-cost, creative methods to address specific barriers to reuniting families, such as Arizona's Housing Assistance Program which helped reunite 939 children with their families between 1991 and 1995, saving the state over $1 million. Arizona and Kentucky also focused on expediting the process to terminate parental rights when reunification was not likely.

However, FAA has expressed concerns about the long-term revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency of the current funding system because key revenue drivers like ticket prices are not well linked to FAA's workload and costs.

* The administration's proposed funding changes aim to address concerns by linking revenues more closely with costs, such as through direct user charges for commercial aviation and increased fuel taxes for general aviation based on FAA's cost allocation study. However, the effectiveness of the proposed funding structure depends on how well the cost allocation method assigns costs to users and how closely the structure adheres to cost-based funding principles. Questions remain about FAA's cost allocation methodology and its adherence to cost-based funding in some instances.

* For Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding, which cannot be directly linked to costs imposed by users, the administration proposes equal fuel taxes on commercial and general aviation. Based on FAA forecasts, commercial aviation would pay about 88% of these fuel taxes in FY2009, while general aviation would pay 12%. However, about one-third of AIP grants go to general aviation airports, raising potential equity issues with commercial aviation funding a large share of these benefits.

* The report examines transit-oriented development near federally funded transit lines and factors that support or hinder such development. Transit-oriented development is typically a compact, mixed-use, walkable neighborhood near transit stations. Stakeholders involved include transit agencies, local governments, private developers, and lenders. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has been expanding its role in transit-oriented development in recent years.

* The amount of transit-oriented development varied widely among the six case study transit lines examined. Factors supporting development included real estate demand, available land, resident support, and efficient transit connections to jobs and activity centers. Challenges included higher construction costs, reluctant lenders, lengthy approval processes, unsupportive residents, and unattractive land around stations.

* Local governments can encourage transit-oriented development through zoning regulations, station area planning, infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. These tools are most successful when aligned with residents' preferences and market demand. Examples include transit-oriented development districts, neighborhood plans, multi-modal connections to stations, and tax credits for developers.

* The FTA assesses factors related to transit-oriented development when reviewing transit projects for potential funding, but these factors make up only a small part of the overall evaluation. The land use and economic development criteria consider transit-supportive plans, policies, and impacts. However, real estate market conditions and cultural factors influencing dense development are challenging to fully evaluate.

* Among the case studies, the amount of transit-oriented development realized was generally consistent with the FTA's pre-construction evaluation of land use and economic development factors. Projects rated highly, such as in Charlotte and San Francisco, were surrounded by new transit-oriented developments. Local policies cited by the FTA, such as zoning changes and growth strategies, had led to new development.

* The Social Security Administration (SSA) introduced the Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (PEBES) in 1988 to enable workers to review their earnings records and obtain benefit estimates. The PEBES legislation requires SSA to automatically send statements to eligible workers according to a set schedule. By fiscal year 2000, SSA will have mailed statements to over 70 million workers, with the goals of better informing the public of available benefits, assisting workers in financial planning, and ensuring earnings records are accurate. Issuing the PEBES is a significant initiative for SSA, with projected costs of $80 million in fiscal year 2000.

* SSA makes certain assumptions when estimating retirement benefits in the PEBES, such as assuming individuals will continue working until retirement and their future earnings will remain similar to recent earnings. While this approach is considered reasonable by experts, the PEBES estimates may over- or understate benefits for certain individuals due to not varying the methodology for special circumstances. For example, PEBES estimates are overstated for federal workers eligible for both Civil Service Retirement System and Social Security benefits, as the law requires a reduction in their Social Security benefits which is not reflected in the PEBES estimates. SSA states it would be too difficult and costly to consider such circumstances.

* SSA has conducted surveys and focus groups to assess public reaction to receiving an unsolicited PEBES. In response to feedback, SSA has revised the statement, such as adding a benefit estimate for early retirement at age 62 when it learned many people were interested in this information. SSA also applied a readability formula and concluded the PEBES could be understood at a seventh grade reading level. Overall public reaction to the unsolicited PEBES has been consistently favorable, with the majority glad to receive the statements and finding the information helpful for financial planning.

* Despite SSA's efforts to improve the PEBES, the current statement still provides too much information which may overwhelm readers, and presents the information in a way that undermines its usefulness. These weaknesses are partly due to SSA's development process of adding information and explanations that have made the statement longer but still confusing for some readers.

Approximately 1.2 million beneficiaries, or 14 percent, receive benefits from both programs concurrently. Concurrent beneficiaries tend to be younger, female, and have mental impairments. About 11 percent of concurrent beneficiaries work, with median earnings of $250 per month.

• SSA must apply complex DI and SSI program rules independently for concurrent beneficiaries who work. Most SSA field offices specialize in either DI or SSI, making it difficult to effectively serve concurrent beneficiaries. SSA guidance does not provide integrated instructions for processing work information or explaining the effect of work on both DI and SSI benefits. As a result, SSA may not collect all required information or share it between programs.

• SSA procedures make it difficult to adjust DI benefits in a timely manner when concurrent beneficiaries work. Field offices cannot immediately adjust DI benefits and must transfer cases to processing centers. SSA lacks comprehensive systems to track transferred cases and identify when trial work periods are ending. Consequently, some beneficiaries continue receiving benefits they are no longer due, potentially resulting in $350 million in DI overpayments in 2001.

• SSA tested a new employment support representative position to better serve working beneficiaries. These specialists received extensive training on both DI and SSI work incentives. Concentrating expertise and duties in a single position could improve service to concurrent beneficiaries. However, it is unclear if SSA will implement the position permanently.

FEMA received $42.6 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and 22 other agencies received the remaining $45.4 billion. FEMA uses mission assignments to direct other federal agencies to support disaster relief operations.

* FEMA's required weekly reports to Congress have limited usefulness from a governmentwide perspective because FEMA does not have mechanisms to collect and report information from other agencies performing work on its behalf through mission assignments. The federal government also lacks a framework to collect and consolidate information from the 22 other agencies that directly received hurricane relief funding. Without this, it is difficult to determine how much has been spent, obligated, and remains available.

* FEMA's reported obligations for mission assignments are overstated because they reflect the total amount of the mission assignment, while agencies only report actual obligations incurred. Some agencies also did not have mission assignments recorded in their systems that were in FEMA's system. FEMA's reported expenditures are understated because it does not recognize reimbursements to agencies until their documentation is reviewed and approved.

* Agencies have not always provided adequate documentation to support their reimbursement requests, leading FEMA to ""charge back"" $267 million, mostly from five agencies. The Army Corps of Engineers, which cannot use the IPAC reimbursement system, has experienced significant delays in receiving payment from FEMA due to billing and documentation problems.

* CERP personnel, including those who had recently returned from Afghanistan, expressed a need for more personnel to perform program management and oversight functions. Tasks like project monitoring, oversight, and collecting metrics on completed projects were often not accomplished due to a lack of personnel.

* Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and channel them back into the economy. Banks generally use deposits to make loans or invest in debt securities like government bonds. Mutual funds invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks, with money flowing to security issuers through primary or secondary markets.

* The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining since the 1960s. Corporations and households have become less dependent on bank loans, with securitization allowing loans to be sold and financed through securities instead of bank credit. The increased provision of direct loans by nonbank financial intermediaries has also diminished the importance of bank loans.

* To assess the impact of mutual funds on deposits, data from industry sources, bank regulators, and the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds Accounts were examined and compared. The change in the level of bank deposits and money market mutual funds from one period to the next determines the net flows. For longer-term mutual funds, net flows are calculated from changes in amounts outstanding adjusted for movements in security prices.

* The Federal Reserve and Securities Industry Association agree that the flow of funds into mutual funds has significantly impacted bank deposits. Although the amount in mutual funds was considerably less than in bank deposits at the end of 1994, mutual fund totals had risen by almost $1.2 trillion since 1989, mostly from net inflows, while deposits declined by $89 billion. Most observers agree mutual funds have had a significant effect on deposits, despite some claims to the contrary.

The total net flows into mutual funds from 1990-1994 were $1,067 billion, but the impact on deposits was less since there were also nondeposit inflows. Using the deposit-to-GDP ratio as a benchmark suggests the total impact may have been sizable but probably less than $700 billion.

• Medicare is a federal health insurance program that uses a network of contractors called intermediaries and carriers to process claims. These contractors review and pay claims, maintain program safeguards, and educate and respond to providers and beneficiaries. Medicare contracting differs from most federal programs in that there is no full and open competition and contracts are cost-based without profit.

• Medicare could benefit from contracting reforms such as directly choosing contractors competitively from a broader array of entities. Allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions and paying them based on performance could lead to greater efficiency. The ability to terminate contracts more efficiently when needs change or performance is inadequate could also improve program management.

• When Medicare was created, providers feared too much government control so the program was designed to be administered by health insurers. Regulations and agency practices have further limited contracting to health insurers, even as the number of insurers willing to serve as contractors has declined. While this made sense initially, the growth of information technology has increased the potential to use new types of entities for claims administration.

• CMS has repeatedly proposed legislative changes to repeal provider nomination authority and make explicit its authority to contract with entities besides health insurers. The HHS Secretary recently stated that CMS should be able to competitively award contracts to the best qualified entities. Such changes would allow CMS to select from a wider pool of companies when a contractor leaves the program.

• Functional contracting, where separate contractors handle specific claims administration activities, could enable CMS to select contractors more skilled at certain tasks and allow specialization to enhance performance. Current regulations constrain CMS from awarding separate contracts for individual functions. CMS has some experience with functional contracting through program safeguard contractors (PSCs), but this has its own challenges.

• Allowing Medicare to offer financial incentives to contractors for high-quality performance could lead to improved operations and lower costs. The Social Security Act currently precludes this by stipulating payments be cost-based without profit. Repealing these restrictions would allow CMS to test different payment options to determine which work best, although implementing performance-based contracting has significant challenges.

The DSB's first report concluded that outsourcing support services could save 30-40% and generate $7-12 billion in annual savings by 2002. The second report estimated that DOD could save $30 billion annually by 2002, with $6 billion coming from outsourcing continental US logistics infrastructure activities.

• The DSB reports stated that to achieve significant savings, DOD needs to make dramatic changes like expanding contractor logistics support and prime vendor use. The reports align with GAO findings that DOD has opportunities to reduce costs and improve performance by changing business processes, but GAO focuses first on reengineering and streamlining before outsourcing where appropriate. DOD has considered actions like consolidating workloads, using prime vendors, and public-private competitions, which have generated savings. Adequate competition has been key to achieving significant cost reductions in public-private competitions.

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists both provide mental health services, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medication due to their medical training. The MHSS created the Psychopharmacology Demonstration Project (PDP) in 1991 to train psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication in certain circumstances.

• The services determine their readiness needs for psychiatrists and psychologists separately. As of 1998, the MHSS had more than enough psychiatrists and psychologists to meet current and upcoming readiness requirements. Therefore, the MHSS had no need for additional prescribing psychologists.

• The PDP faced several persistent implementation problems, including lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified selection criteria, curriculum changes, delays in granting prescribing privileges, and unresolved supervision issues. These problems were partly due to the lack of precedent and experience with allowing psychologists to prescribe medication. Defining the role and scope of practice of prescribing psychologists remained an issue.

• The total cost of the PDP will be about $6.1 million through completion, or about $610,000 per graduate. Most of the cost was for classroom training at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and lost productivity of participants and supervisors. The cost per graduate would have been lower if the project attracted more participants and progressed beyond the developmental stage.

• The PDP produced 10 prescribing psychologists for the MHSS. This increased the number of mental health providers who can prescribe medication and reduced psychiatrists' workloads in some cases. However, psychiatrists, psychologists and primary care physicians had differing opinions on the impact on quality of care and collaboration.

* Coal-fueled electricity generating units provide a large share of electricity in the US, but this share has declined in recent years. To address concerns over air pollution, water resources, and solid waste, the EPA recently proposed or finalized four key regulations that will affect coal-fueled units. These regulations have potentially significant implications for public health and the environment, including reducing SO emissions, mercury emissions, and human health impacts.

* DOE, EPA, and FERC have taken initial steps to monitor industry progress in responding to the regulations, including jointly conducting regular meetings with key industry stakeholders. Recent and pending actions on the four existing regulations, as well as EPA's recently proposed regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, may require additional monitoring efforts. RTO officials and other industry stakeholders also noted that retirement of coal-fueled generating units may lead to increasing reliance on natural gas, which will require construction of new pipeline and storage infrastructure.

* According to GAO's analysis, power companies plan to retire a greater percentage of coal-fueled generating capacity and retrofit less capacity than previous estimates, with most retirements occurring by the end of 2015. The units being retired are generally older, smaller, more polluting, not used extensively, and geographically concentrated in certain states. Careful monitoring and coordination by federal agencies incorporating the views of stakeholders will be important as key regulations are finalized and implemented.

• FSA field offices do not consistently determine eligibility of estates kept open for more than 2 years to receive farm program payments, as required by regulations. Without performing these annual determinations, FSA cannot identify estates being kept open primarily to receive payments and ensure payments are proper. Under USDA regulations, an estate can receive payments for 2 years after an individual's death if it meets eligibility requirements, and can continue receiving payments beyond that if FSA determines the estate is not being kept open primarily for payments. However, FSA did not conduct any eligibility determinations for 40% of estates requiring them from 1999-2005.

• Even when FSA conducted eligibility determinations, there were shortcomings such as approving eligibility based on insufficient information or explanations for keeping estates open. In some cases, FSA field offices approved payments to groups of estates without any apparent determination. The extent to which FSA makes eligibility determinations varies widely from state to state, suggesting inconsistent implementation of eligibility rules. Conducting determinations could also uncover other problems like individuals receiving payments beyond what is allowed under the three-entity rule.

• FSA lacks appropriate management controls to verify it is not making payments to deceased individuals, such as matching payment databases with the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. Complex farming operations with embedded entities make it difficult for FSA to prevent improper payments to deceased individuals. From 1999-2005, FSA paid $1.1 billion in farm program payments to deceased individuals, with 40% going to those dead for 3+ years and 19% to those dead for 7+ years.

• Wildland fires play an important ecological role in shaping the composition of forests and grasslands across the United States. Various land use and management practices over the past century have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many ecosystems and contributed to abnormally dense vegetation accumulations. These practices, combined with more homes and communities built in fire-prone areas, have increased the threat to lives, health, property, and infrastructure. Changing climate conditions have also increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons in certain parts of the country.

• Working collaboratively across federal and nonfederal boundaries to address wildland fire issues can involve the nation's federal, state, local, private, or tribal lands. The majority of land is privately owned and managed, while about 30 percent is managed by federal agencies. State and local governments have primary responsibility for managing wildland fires on nonfederal lands and share responsibility for protecting homes and private structures. The challenge of balancing the benefits of periodic fires with fire's negative effects on communities is particularly difficult in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where development has increased in recent decades.

• Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in various ways to reduce wildfire risk through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. Fuel reduction removes flammable vegetation that can fuel fires, and federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities to prioritize and conduct these activities. Preparedness activities ensure communities have access to fire suppression resources, prevention activities aim to reduce human-caused fires, and education helps homeowners and communities understand risk-reducing actions they can take. Some federal-nonfederal collaboration at the national level encompasses all types of risk-reduction efforts.

• In recent decades, federal agencies have reassessed their approach to wildland fire management and placed greater emphasis on coordinating with nonfederal entities to reduce risk. The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy of 1995 and subsequent updates sought to make communities and resources less susceptible to damage from fires.

• American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are five U.S. territories with Medicaid and CHIP programs. The territories have some discretion in setting eligibility standards, payment rates, benefits, and administrative structures under federal guidelines. Territories are afforded greater flexibility than states, such as the ability to set income eligibility levels and use local poverty levels. However, federal Medicaid and CHIP funding for territories is capped, unlike for states.

• Territories must report quarterly Medicaid and CHIP expenditures on the CMS-64 for federal reimbursement. Recent legislation has provided temporary increases in Medicaid and CHIP funding for territories. For example, PPACA appropriated $7.3 billion in additional Medicaid funding through fiscal year 2019 and increased the territories' FMAP rates. Territories are responsible for Medicaid and CHIP program integrity and are required to implement certain program integrity mechanisms.

• Territories' Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and benefits reflect their unique circumstances and differ from each other and the states. For example, Puerto Rico is the only territory that uses CHIP funds to cover additional children, while the others use CHIP funds for Medicaid children under 19. Some territories use local poverty levels more restrictive than federal standards, resulting in lower enrollment.

Over 90% of tobacco grown in the U.S. and worldwide is used for cigarettes, with the remainder used for other tobacco products. Pesticides increase tobacco production by reducing pests, but exposure to pesticides can harm human health.

• EPA regulates pesticides in the U.S. by requiring registration, setting tolerances for residues on food/feed crops, and reviewing older pesticides. EPA assesses health risks of pesticides based on toxicity studies and residue levels, considering exposure of workers and the general public from food, water, and residential use. For tobacco, EPA requires toxicity data but only requires residue data if residues exceed a threshold of concern. EPA's risk assessments have led to some mitigation measures for pesticides used on tobacco, such as protective equipment for workers, but not for residues on tobacco itself.

• In the 1990s, 37 pesticides were commonly used on U.S. tobacco, mostly insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides also used on food crops.

• User fees assign part or all of the costs of federal programs to identifiable users who receive benefits beyond what is normally available to the public. The boundaries between fees and taxes are not always clear, and the tradeoffs among design elements can be relevant to both.
• User fees can promote equity by following the beneficiary-pays principle, where costs are assigned to those who use and benefit from the services. They can also enhance economic efficiency by ensuring resources are allocated to the most valued use as users adjust consumption based on costs and benefits.
• Setting user fee rates is challenging and requires determining program costs and how to assign those costs among different users. Fees should be set and adjusted to cover the intended share of program costs over time.
• User fee collections can occur at the point of sale, point of service, or after the service is provided. The primary challenge is striking a balance between ensuring compliance and minimizing administrative costs.
• Congress determines the extent to which an agency can access and obligate fee collections. Mechanisms range from requiring annual appropriations to allowing agencies to use collections without further Congressional action.
• Regular, comprehensive fee reviews and updates can improve transparency, align fees with program costs and activities, and provide opportunities for stakeholder input. Reviews can be triggered by sunset provisions or reporting requirements.
• Effectively communicating with stakeholders involves sharing relevant information and analysis and providing opportunities for input, which can affect their support and acceptance of the fee. Advisory committees are one mechanism to solicit stakeholder input.
• User fee design involves making trade-offs among equity, efficiency, revenue adequacy, and administrative burden. Policymakers must balance the importance placed on each criteria and focus on the overall fee design.
• Key questions to consider in user fee design include the extent to which the program benefits the public versus users, how the fee will be linked to costs, and how the fee will be structured to cover costs over time. Other important considerations are compliance and administrative costs, agency access to collections, and review and update mechanisms.

• The federal government faces systemic acquisition challenges that impact its ability to achieve the best return on investment. Agency budgets may not be fully linked to strategic goals and may not adequately consider resource limitations. Agencies often pursue their individual needs rather than collective needs, and individual program and funding decisions may undercut sound policies. Congressional direction sometimes requires agencies to buy unplanned and unneeded items and services.

• Agencies often overpromise and underdeliver in acquiring major systems, with programs experiencing requirements instability, proceeding without adequate knowledge, and being underfunded. This results in cost escalation, schedule delays, and reduced capabilities. Agencies need to translate needs into appropriate, executable programs by setting realistic requirements, maintaining stability, and ensuring programs have requisite knowledge and funding.

• Agencies face challenges in setting contract requirements, using appropriate contract types and incentives, and providing proper oversight, especially for service contracts. Time-and-materials contracts, interagency contracting, undefinitized contract actions, and lead systems integrators pose risks that require greater attention. Incentive and award fees are often paid without clear links to outcomes. Inadequate oversight contributes to poor acquisition outcomes.

• The government needs to fundamentally re-examine when and under what circumstances it should use contractors versus civil servants or military personnel. The rapid growth in contracting has prompted debates about the proper role of contractors in providing services to the government. Factors prompting the use of contractors could include inadequate force structure, outdated hiring policies, and insufficient full-time equivalent slots.

• The acquisition workforce faces serious challenges related to its size, skills, knowledge, and succession planning. The workload and complexity have increased while the workforce has decreased in size. Key program staff rotate too frequently, reducing accountability. The revolving door between industry and government presents potential conflicts of interest.

• Inadequate oversight has resulted in little accountability for recurring acquisition problems. Lack of high-level leadership attention reduces the chances of success in acquisition and other key business areas. Agencies need to hold the acquisition workforce accountable and ensure sustained leadership to drive improvements.

• Addressing these challenges is imperative given the government's fiscal condition and the need to achieve the best return on investment. Much can and should be done to minimize waste and misman",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '•'}"

* The Department of Defense (DOD) sets a standard price per barrel each fiscal year to charge its fuel customers. The standard price is based on crude oil price forecasts from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a refinement markup, and nonproduct costs like transportation and storage.

* From fiscal years 2009-2013, DOD's actual fuel costs differed considerably from its budget estimates, largely due to fluctuations in fuel prices. Differences between the services' estimated and actual fuel consumption also contributed to the overall difference between estimated and actual costs.

* DOD took actions to manage fluctuations in the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund caused by differences in estimated and actual fuel costs. These actions included transferring funds into the fund from other accounts and adjusting the standard price charged to fuel customers.

* Since 2004, DOD has studied various aspects of its bulk fuel program, but has not updated its approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions. DOD's assumptions do not consider differences between crude oil benchmarks, differences between domestic and international crude oil prices, and the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices.

* Other federal agencies have adjusted their crude oil benchmarks for estimating energy prices. However, DOD has not reevaluated whether using the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil benchmark with a refinement markup is still appropriate given recent market changes.

* DOD has not fully documented its rationale and assumptions for establishing each component of the standard price. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states a cost estimate should be supported by detailed documentation describing how it was derived.

* GAO recommends the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), to reevaluate the approach for estimating the components of the standard price. GAO also recommends documenting assumptions, including providing detailed rationale for how each component is estimated.

* The Department of Defense (DOD) initiated the Standard Procurement System (SPS) program in 1994 to acquire and deploy a single automated system to perform contract management functions across all DOD organizations. SPS was to replace 76 legacy systems, standardize procurement practices, and provide accurate contract information. However, SPS has faced delays, cost increases, and issues with user satisfaction and realized benefits.

* The DOD Inspector General has issued multiple reports critical of SPS, citing concerns about functionality, user needs not being met, inadequate training and support, and reliance on a single vendor. The SPS program office initiated a study in 2000 to assess benefits from implementing SPS version 4.1. However, the study was poorly planned and executed, making it unable to validate benefit realization.

* DOD has not met key SPS commitments regarding timely product delivery, user satisfaction, and use of a commercial solution. The program is 3.5 years behind schedule with further delays likely. Surveys show approximately 60% of users are dissatisfied with SPS functionality and performance.

* DOD committed to SPS producing benefits like replacing legacy systems, standardizing practices, and reducing problem disbursements. However, DOD does not know the extent to which these benefits are being realized. Only 2 of the original 76 legacy systems have been retired, each service is developing its own unique practices, and there is no evidence of reduced problem disbursements.

* SPS life-cycle costs have increased from $3 billion to $3.7 billion, but DOD is not tracking actual total costs against estimates. Only SPS program office costs of $322 million are being reported, while DOD components have collectively spent at least $125 million that is not being tracked. Without knowing if SPS is meeting expectations, DOD cannot make informed decisions on proceeding with the program.

* DOD has not economically justified investing in SPS, as its own analysis shows life-cycle costs exceed benefits.

* Medicaid was established in 1965 as a jointly funded federal-state program providing medical assistance to low-income persons. Each state designs and administers its own Medicaid program, subject to federal requirements. To control escalating costs, some states have sought waivers to move Medicaid populations into capitated managed care.

* Tennessee's TennCare demonstration project uses a capitated managed care system to expand coverage to the uninsured while controlling costs. The state-federal financing plan favors the state, as several waiver provisions allow it to reduce its share of spending. The waiver also includes provisions to monitor and ensure enrollee access to quality care.

* TennCare expanded coverage by allowing non-Medicaid eligible uninsured and uninsurable persons to enroll and by extending coverage periods for Medicaid-eligible persons. It increased the scope of coverage by lifting service restrictions and allowing additional services. Enrollees above the poverty level are required to pay premiums, deductibles, and copayments.

* To implement TennCare, the state contracted with 12 MCOs to provide services in exchange for monthly per-enrollee payments. Most enrollees have a choice of four or more MCOs. TennCare encourages managed care by requiring enrollees to stay with an MCO for a year and not allowing cost-sharing for preventive care.

* To finance expanded coverage while keeping expenditures within budget limits, Tennessee set capitation rates substantially below historical Medicaid costs, discontinued its DSH program, and established a smaller Primary Care Provider Fund. Savings from these actions were expected to offset the costs of expanded coverage. The waiver agreement includes overall and interim federal funding limits to ensure budget neutrality.

* The federal spending limits for TennCare apply to the entire program, including services not covered under capitated payments. Analysis shows the federal spending allowed in the first year exceeds estimated federal Medicaid spending without TennCare, but amounts allowed in subsequent years are less.

• DOD relies on research labs, industry, and academia to develop new technologies to improve military operations and maintain superiority over adversaries. However, DOD has historically had problems transitioning technologies out of labs and into real use. To address this, DOD and Congress have established several ""technology transition"" programs, each with a particular focus.

• Three recent initiatives are the Technology Transition Initiative (TTI), Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP), and Quick Reaction Fund, which together received about $64 million in fiscal year 2005. The programs, which are being implemented consistent with congressional intent, have reported benefits in many projects, including improvements to performance, affordability, manufacturability, and operational capability. However, it is too early to determine the overall impact of these programs on technology transition.

• To effectively transition technologies, programs need to establish effective selection, management and oversight, and assessment processes. The DACP had the most disciplined and well-defined processes overall, while the TTI had disciplined selection processes but less formal management and oversight. The Quick Reaction Fund was the least formal and disciplined, relying more on flexibility and senior management attention.

• The DACP has a robust selection process using internet tools to reach a broad audience, assessing proposals' potential benefits and risks, and securing commitments from acquisition managers. The TTI also has a rigorous selection process with specific criteria and a team to assess proposals, but does not formally confirm technology readiness levels. The Quick Reaction Fund had a less structured selection process to move technologies rapidly, but experienced some problems as a result.

• For management and oversight, the DACP monitors projects through formal quarterly reporting and meetings to ensure commitment and resolve problems. The TTI employs periodic reports and meetings, but communication has not been as open, leading to some problems not being identified. The Quick Reaction Fund requires after-action reports but does not regularly review them, and the program manager was unaware of some problems that arose.

• The transition programs have limited measures to gauge individual project success and program impact or return on investment.

* The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) was created in 1991 to consolidate and standardize the Department of Defense's (DOD) finance and accounting operations, which were previously handled separately by each military service. DFAS assumed control of the military services' finance and accounting centers and many of the finance and accounting functions at 332 military installations. DFAS and the military services now share finance and accounting responsibilities based on agreements negotiated between DFAS and each service. DFAS is working to reduce the number of finance and accounting systems used across DOD.

* DOD's finance and accounting network currently consists of DFAS, which reports to the DOD Comptroller, and the military services' financial management organizations, which report to their respective service secretaries. As of 1996, DFAS had about 23,500 employees and the military services estimated they had about 17,300 people performing finance and accounting functions, for a total of around 40,800. DFAS's budget for fiscal year 1996 was $1.64 billion, and the military services estimated their finance and accounting personnel costs at $598 million. The total DOD budget for finance and accounting exceeds $2 billion.

* DOD's finance and accounting operations handle four main types of funds: general funds appropriated by Congress, working capital funds generated by DOD business activities, nonappropriated funds from the sale of goods and services to DOD personnel, and security assistance funds for sales of military equipment to foreign governments. The main finance activities include paying salaries, retiree/annuitant pay, travel reimbursements, and contractor/vendor invoices, as well as collecting debts owed to DOD. In fiscal year 1996, DOD accounted for over $338 billion in general funds, $74 billion in working capital funds, $500 million in nonappropriated funds, and $28 billion in security assistance funds.

• The Federal Reserve Act established the Federal Reserve as an independent central bank with a decentralized structure consisting of the Board of Governors, 12 regional Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Reserve Banks are federally chartered corporations with member banks as stockholders, and are subject to oversight by the Board of Governors. The FOMC is responsible for conducting monetary policy to promote price stability, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates.

• The stock purchase requirement in the Federal Reserve Act was intended to balance power between the government and private banks, capitalize the Reserve Banks, and attract state banks to Federal Reserve membership. Modifying the stock ownership requirement by retiring stock, making ownership voluntary, or making the entire capital contribution callable could have implications for Reserve Bank autonomy, Federal Reserve independence, and Reserve Bank operations, but mechanisms could be implemented to preserve the key attributes of the current structure.

* The exchange rate policies of some East Asian nations, particularly China, Japan, and South Korea, have been sources of tension with the United States. Some analysts argue these policies constitute currency manipulation to gain an unfair trade advantage. The U.S. Treasury is required to analyze the exchange rate policies of major trading partners and determine if any are manipulating their currencies.

* Countries can choose between a free float, a fixed or pegged rate, or a managed float for their exchange rate policy. A free float allows greater autonomy for domestic monetary policy but has higher exchange rate risk. A fixed rate eliminates exchange rate risk but sacrifices monetary policy autonomy.

* Most East Asian countries have adopted a managed float policy, allowing their currency's value to fluctuate within a band or based on economic factors. Categorizing a country's actual policy can be complicated, as the official policy may differ from actual practices observed in forex markets. For example, South Korea officially has a free float but has intervened to influence the won's value.

* China maintained a crawling peg policy prior to the 2008 financial crisis, allowing the renminbi to gradually appreciate or depreciate based on market forces. During the crisis, the renminbi remained stable against the dollar, leading to speculation that China had shifted to a fixed exchange rate. In 2010, China announced it would enhance the flexibility of the renminbi.

* Japan's yen has seen major shifts in value against the dollar over the past decade. The Japanese government has denied claims it is manipulating the yen's value, asserting that its economic policies are aimed at stimulating growth and ending deflation. The last confirmed Japanese intervention in forex markets was in 2011.

The apparent co-movement of some currencies with China's renminbi from 2007-2008 and 2011-2013 led analysts to speculate about an emerging ""renminbi bloc.""

COMs derive their authority from the Constitution, the Foreign Service Act of 1980, executive orders, and presidential directives. They are tasked with coordinating and supervising executive branch personnel and activities, and executive branch agencies are obligated to keep the COM fully informed of their activities.

Early indicators suggest China's economy may be starting to recover, though there are concerns about the sustainability of the recovery.

* The taxation of capital gains and losses has been frequently debated by Congress since the individual income tax began in 1913. Currently, long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum 15% rate while short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income rates up to 35%. Net capital losses can be deducted against ordinary income up to an annual limit of $3,000. Some have proposed increasing this loss limit to $10,000 or $15,000.

* The $3,000 loss limit prevents taxpayers from selectively realizing losses to minimize taxes. The current system treats capital gains and losses asymmetrically, allowing gaming of the system by timing gains and losses in different years. Increasing the loss limit would exacerbate this problem. Economic analysis suggests expanding the loss deduction would not provide effective economic stimulus.

* From 1913-1916, capital losses were only deductible if associated with a trade or business. From 1916-1918, losses were deductible up to the amount of capital gains. From 1918-1921, excess capital losses were deductible against ordinary income. The Revenue Act of 1921 divided assets into short-term and long-term categories.

* The Revenue Act of 1924 introduced a 12.5% tax credit for net long-term losses to address asymmetry in gain and loss treatment. In 1938, different percentage inclusion rules were set for assets held 18-24 months and over 24 months. The Revenue Act of 1942 established a $1,000 limit on capital loss deductions against ordinary income and a 5-year loss carryover.

A 1998 State Department document indicated Cuba was added because of its support for the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia. A 2003 State Department report said Cuba provided support to the FALN in Puerto Rico, the FMLN in El Salvador, and the FSLN in Nicaragua.

• The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is an alternative tax calculation that adds back certain deductions and taxes income above an exemption at rates of 26% and 28%. While originally affecting only high-income taxpayers, the AMT is projected to affect over 6% of taxpayers by 2009 as it expands to middle and upper-middle income brackets.

• Correcting the AMT is costly, with indexing the exemptions estimated to cost $13.9 billion by 2008 and eliminating limits on credits costing $26 billion by 2009. The AMT is particularly likely to affect joint filers, who tend to have higher incomes and more dependents.

• Attempts to fix the marriage penalty in the regular tax code, such as those in H.R. 1836, interact significantly with the AMT. Much of the tax cuts from marriage penalty relief would be taken back by the AMT since it would cause more taxpayers to fall under the AMT.

• Across-the-board tax cuts and credits also interact strongly with the AMT, with the AMT taking back large portions of the cuts over time. Tax cuts targeted more toward lower and middle-incomes are less affected by AMT interactions, at least in the near term.

• Potential approaches to the AMT include: accepting its growth as an alternative flat tax system, indexing the exemptions to maintain its relative importance, adjusting it in tandem with regular tax changes, or taking steps to eventually eliminate it. Each approach has various complications and issues to consider.

• As tax cuts are enacted without AMT reforms, the AMT's future growth and costs to fix it increase substantially. Marriage penalty relief and the 2001 tax cuts demonstrate the significance of AMT interactions that policymakers must grapple with.

• The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate draft bills to fund the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies. DOT is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization that provides grants to state and local governments for transportation infrastructure. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is unique among DOT agencies in that most of its budget goes to operating the U.S. air traffic control system.

• HUD's programs primarily address housing problems for low-income households through rental assistance, block grants, and specialized grants. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for low down payment and affordable rental housing. Funding for DOT and HUD declined in real terms for several years after FY2010.

• Most DOT and HUD funding is discretionary appropriations from the general fund, but some funding comes from mandatory contract authority based on trust funds. Appropriators set limits on total discretionary funding and use rescissions of unobligated balances and offsetting receipts and collections to offset higher funding levels. In FY2017, these offsets allowed appropriators to provide $10.1 billion more in discretionary funding than the allocation.

• The Trump Administration requested $106.65 billion for THUD for FY2018, a $9.7 billion reduction from FY2017. The House bill would provide $115.3 billion (a <1% cut) while the Senate bill would provide $119.1 billion (a 2% increase); accounting for inflation, these represent a 3% cut and slight increase respectively.

• Milk protein concentrates (MPCs), which include casein and caseinates derived from milk, are used in various food products. Imports of MPCs to the U.S. currently have limited trade restrictions, while many other dairy imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas. Advocates argue stricter import controls would encourage domestic protein use and raise milk prices for farmers, while opponents say it would increase costs and retail prices. Major MPC suppliers to the U.S. would likely seek compensation under WTO rules for new import restrictions.

• Milk is 87.4% water and 12.6% milk solids, which include fat, protein, lactose, and minerals. The two main milk proteins are casein and whey, which are used in various food products. MPCs contain both casein and whey and are manufactured through processes like ultrafiltration, blending, and co-precipitation. They are used in products like infant formula, processed cheeses, frozen desserts, and sports nutrition products.

• The U.S. produces little casein or MPCs, possibly due to dairy policies favoring nonfat dry milk production. In 2008, the U.S. imported over $3 billion in dairy products, with MPCs and casein representing 35%. Imports are modest compared to domestic production at around 3%. Legislation has been proposed to restrict MPC imports by implementing tariff-rate quotas.

• Dairy farmers and producers generally support import restrictions on MPCs, arguing they would close a loophole allowing certain proteins to disrupt domestic prices. However, dairy processors oppose restrictions, concerned they would increase costs, raise consumer prices, and jeopardize export gains. The price impact of import restrictions depends on domestic prices relative to government support levels. Proposed restrictions could have a relatively small effect on U.S. milk prices overall.

In Florida v. Jardines, the Court ruled that a trained drug-sniffing dog's sniff at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause.

* 35 states have established high risk health insurance pools to provide coverage to individuals who cannot obtain or afford private health insurance, primarily due to preexisting health conditions. These pools generally cover people who have been denied coverage, received high premium quotes, or had preexisting conditions excluded from coverage in the individual market. Many states also use high risk pools to comply with HIPAA portability and guaranteed availability provisions. Enrollment in high risk pools tends to be limited, with about 200,000 individuals enrolled in 2008 compared to an estimated 4 million who were potentially eligible.

* High risk pools fill a niche in the patchwork health insurance system for individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance and are not eligible for public programs. Applicants to the individual insurance market undergo medical underwriting, and insurers may reject applications, exclude coverage for preexisting conditions, or charge higher premiums based on health status. Federal and state laws place some restrictions on insurers' ability to reject applications or design coverage based on health factors in the nongroup market. Nonetheless, the individual market enrollee population tends to be fairly healthy, often excluding persons with moderate to severe health conditions.

* Supporters argue that high risk pools allow states to use their existing regulatory infrastructure and knowledge of health care markets to efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals. They contend that removing high-risk individuals from the nongroup market and placing them in subsidized pools makes individual market coverage more affordable and stable. High risk pools also function as a safety net by assuring access to health insurance for those willing and able to pay for it. Critics argue that high risk pools are too small and underfunded to meet the needs of most uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions.

* The Obama Administration has faced scrutiny for limiting or delaying enforcement of certain federal laws based on practical or policy considerations, relying on prosecutorial discretion in the criminal context and administrative enforcement discretion in the civil context.
* Courts have generally held that prosecutorial discretion is a function of the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, and the duties of prosecutors as appointees of the President, and therefore they are reluctant to review discretionary prosecutorial decisions.
* Similarly, courts have held that administrative enforcement decisions are presumptively unreviewable, based on the Administrative Procedure Act's preclusion of judicial review for actions ""committed to agency discretion by law.""
* However, the presumption against judicial review of enforcement decisions may be overcome where the substantive statute provides guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers or where the agency has adopted a general policy that amounts to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.
* Congress has the authority to limit or circumscribe executive enforcement discretion by statute, but the precise scope of this authority, especially in the criminal context, remains an open question.

The U.S. is also subject to the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), which governs whether domestic support causes adverse market effects for other WTO members. Domestic farm programs found to be in violation of WTO rules may be subject to dispute settlement and require changes by Congress to become compliant.

* To determine WTO compliance, U.S. farm programs can be evaluated based on their AoA classification (green, blue, amber box), whether they qualify for exemption from counting towards the amber box limit, and whether their support causes market distortions that adversely affect other WTO members under SCM rules. In its 2012 notification, the U.S. included $127.5 billion in green box outlays, no blue box outlays, $5.3 billion in de minimis exclusions, and $6.9 billion counted towards its $19.1 billion amber box limit.

• The campus-based aid programs - Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan - are among the oldest federal student aid programs. They are unique in that federal funds are awarded directly to institutions, which then determine the mix and amount of aid to award to students. The campus-based programs now play a relatively small role, accounting for only 2% of the $125 billion in federal student aid made available in FY2016.

• Funds for the campus-based programs are allocated to institutions through a two-stage process involving a base guarantee and a fair share amount. There has been a decline in the proportion of institutions participating in the campus-based programs over the past decade. In AY2015-2016, only a small percentage of undergraduate students received aid through the FSEOG (5%), FWS (5%), and Perkins Loan (2%) programs.

• As Congress considers reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, several issues related to the campus-based programs may be considered, including whether they serve a distinct purpose compared to other federal aid programs, whether the allocation formula is optimal, and whether certain program-specific provisions should be modified. The Perkins Loan program authorization has expired and is currently winding down, which may result in students losing access to the additional borrowing capacity it provides.

The report identifies additional resources that provide context and lists CRS policy experts for specific topics. The reports track legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding. Discussion of appropriations involves specialized budgetary concepts explained in the Appendix.

• For FY2017, the Obama Administration requested $40.62 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, a 0.8% decrease from FY2016. The request included additional funding not counted against discretionary spending limits. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees developed differing appropriations measures in response. Congress passed continuing resolutions providing temporary funding for DHS and enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, providing $41.3 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS, as well as supplemental appropriations and funding for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations.

• DHS began implementing a common appropriations structure (CAS) in FY2017, organizing most DHS appropriations into four standardized categories. The House Appropriations Committee used the CAS while the Senate committee did not. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 used the new structure, which illuminates the relative proportions of funding for different DHS components. Appropriations for specific DHS components are detailed in comparative tables for each of the four main titles of the DHS appropriations act.

* The U.S. Constitution provides two methods for the President to appoint officers: with Senate advice and consent, or unilaterally during a Senate recess. President Obama had difficulty obtaining Senate confirmation for nominees to be Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In January 2012, the President made recess appointments to these positions during a 3-day break between pro forma Senate sessions.

* The President's recess appointments have been controversial and raise significant legal questions about the scope of his appointment power and the validity of actions taken by the appointees. The report begins by providing a legal overview of the Recess Appointments Clause. It then analyzes issues of standing and the political question doctrine that could prevent a court from reaching the merits of a challenge to the appointments.

* The report examines the constitutional validity of the appointments and potential statutory restrictions on a recess appointee's authority. It also discusses how a court ruling that the appointments are unlawful could impact actions taken by the appointees. The Recess Appointments Clause was intended to allow the President to ensure continued functioning of the government when the Senate was unable to provide advice and consent.

* There has been limited judicial interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause, with most analysis coming from the executive branch. It is generally accepted that the Clause applies to both inter-session and intra-session recesses and that a recess appointee has the same legal authority as a confirmed appointee. Congress has previously attempted to restrict the President's recess appointment power through measures like limiting the salaries of recess appointees.

• Mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local employees has been proposed by deficit reduction groups to increase the universality of the program. Proponents argue it would simplify retirement planning, prevent coverage gaps, and provide better benefit protections like dependents' and survivors' benefits and full COLAs.

• The Social Security Administration estimates that mandatory coverage, if implemented, would have a net positive effect on Social Security's long-term finances, closing 8-9% of the projected funding shortfall. However, some argue mandatory coverage could result in state and local governments reducing pension benefits to offset costs.

• State and local pension plans could be impacted if mandatory Social Security coverage was enacted, potentially leading to plan changes, freezes or terminations for new hires. Many state and local pension plans are currently underfunded, which could exacerbate funding shortfalls if contributions decrease.

• The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (LMR) requires meat packers to report prices and other information on purchases of cattle, hogs, lamb, and related meat products to the USDA. LMR was set to expire on September 30, 2015 but was reauthorized by Congress until September 30, 2020 in the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015. Before LMR was enacted in 1999, USDA collected livestock and meat price information from packers on a voluntary basis.

* The United States has approximately 766 million acres of forestlands, with 58% (445 million acres) privately owned by individuals, families, Native American tribes, corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other groups. The federal government, primarily through the Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has numerous programs to support forest management on private and public (state and local) forests. These programs support activities related to planning for and responding to wildfires, as well as developing new uses and markets for wood products. The programs are mostly funded and administered through the State and Private Forestry (SPF) branch of the FS, often with assistance from state partner agencies.

* Federal assistance for nonfederal forest landowners has been a component of USDA programs for over a century, beginning with the creation of the USDA Division of Forestry in 1881. The division was upgraded to the Bureau of Forestry in 1901, and in 1905 it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Forestry to become the USDA Forest Service (FS). The FS has three primary mission areas: managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. Congress authorized specific forestry assistance programs in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924, which was revised in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (CFAA).

* The Senate and House Agriculture Committees have jurisdiction over forestry assistance programs and often examine them in periodic omnibus farm bill legislation. The 2008 farm bill established national funding priorities, enacted a standardized process for states to assess forest resource conditions and strategize about funding needs, and made changes to specific assistance programs. The 2014 farm bill repealed several programs and reauthorized others. Many agricultural programs authorized by the 2014 farm bill, including two forestry programs, are scheduled to expire at the end of FY2018 unless Congress extends or reauthorizes them.

* Most forestry assistance programs are administered by the FS but implemented by state partners. The FS provides technical and financial aid to the states, which then assist private landowners or eligible entities.",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 4, 'n_sentences_total': 28, 'symbol': '*'}"

* Burma is a hub for transnational organized crime, with groups trafficking drugs, humans, guns, wildlife, gems, and timber. Corruption among officials in Burma's ruling military junta facilitates this trafficking and provides criminal groups with immunity from law enforcement.
* Burma's long, remote borders and areas of ethnic tension contribute to the country's ""ungoverned spaces"" where transnational crime flourishes. Recent cease-fire agreements with some ethnic armed rebel groups have given these groups known for transnational crime activity near autonomy in certain regions.
* Congress has imposed sanctions on Burma due to issues like drug trafficking and human trafficking. In 2008, Congress passed additional sanctions on Burmese officials and prohibited the import of Burmese gems.
* Various armed ethnic groups have criminal networks stretching from India to China, with many linked to past or ongoing insurgencies. The United Wa State Army (UWSA) is the largest criminal group, operating freely along the China and Thailand borders due to collusion with Burmese officials.
* Corruption is widespread in Burma's government, military, and business community, with the country ranked as the third-most corrupt in the world. There is evidence that Burmese military officials financially benefit from the drug trade and money laundering.
* Burma is the world's second-largest producer of illicit opium and a major producer of methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs. Opium production has declined but remains an important livelihood for impoverished farmers.
* Burma is designated as a Tier 3 country for human trafficking, with trafficking victims exploited internally and regionally. Burmese officials are directly involved in trafficking for forced labor and child soldiers.
* Illegal trafficking of Burma's natural resources like timber, wildlife, and gems is flowing along the same routes as other forms of trafficking. The Burmese regime is heavily involved in both the legal and illegal trade of gemstones.
* Burma is considered a major money laundering country, with an underdeveloped financial sector and widespread use of informal money transfer networks. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Burma for insufficient efforts to combat drug trafficking, human trafficking, and money laundering, but the effectiveness of these sanctions has been limited.

The Congressional Budget Office projects gross spending on ACA insurance coverage expansion will total $1.938 trillion over FY2017-FY2026, offset by revenues from ACA taxes and fees and savings from Medicare changes. The ACA also included numerous mandatory appropriations providing billions of dollars to support new and existing grant programs and other activities.

* The ACA funded a broad range of programs including temporary insurance programs prior to the exchanges becoming operational in 2014, maternal and child health programs, state grants for exchange planning, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board. It also created and funded the Community Health Center Fund, Prevention and Public Health Fund, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund, and Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund. Most ACA appropriations were temporary, with some funding extended by subsequent legislation, while a few appropriations are permanent.

• The increased presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs and in the scientific workforce is a concern for some in the scientific community. Enrollment of U.S. citizens in these programs has not kept pace with that of foreign students. Arguments for limiting the number of foreign students include the belief that foreign students are using U.S. graduate education as a stepping stone to immigration through sponsorships for permanent residence.

• Approximately 56% of foreign doctorate degree earners on temporary visas remain in the U.S., with many becoming citizens. In 2008, about 15% of those awarded legal permanent resident status resulted from employment-based preferences. There are charges that U.S. workers are adversely affected by the entry of foreign scientists and engineers who accept lower wages.

• The scientific community is divided over proposals to impose stricter immigration limits on people with scientific and technical skills. Some argue that foreign talent is necessary to fill positions and maintain the U.S. as a global leader in science and technology. Others contend that there should be a balance between the needs for a highly skilled workforce and the need to ensure job opportunities for U.S. personnel.

• Following September 11, 2001, the policy on foreign students and scientists was re-evaluated. Concerns were expressed about foreign students receiving education and training in sensitive areas and additional monitoring of foreign students was implemented through SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System). There are concerns that the more stringent requirements have impacted enrollments in colleges and universities and may affect the competitiveness of U.S. industry.

• Legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress to attract foreign students in scientific and technical disciplines while maintaining the interests of American scientists. Bills include H.R. 1736 to address issues impacting the ability of U.S. scientists to collaborate internationally, S. 887 to amend H-1B employer requirements, and H.R. 1791 to provide numerical limitations on immigrants with doctorates in scientific disciplines.

* Cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value that function as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. They operate on decentralized networks using cryptography to validate transactions recorded on public ledgers called blockchains. Cryptocurrencies are not backed by governments or physical commodities.

* Cryptocurrencies could provide benefits compared to traditional payment systems, such as potentially lower transaction costs, increased payment system access for the unbanked, and enhanced privacy. However, they currently face obstacles to widespread adoption, including limited acceptance, high price volatility, lack of scalability, and lack of trust. Cryptocurrencies require their own systems of intermediaries to function as money.

* Criminals may use cryptocurrencies to avoid detection by law enforcement, but law enforcement has some ability to track illicit transactions on the public ledgers and regulate cryptocurrency exchanges for anti-money laundering compliance. Cryptocurrencies may also facilitate tax evasion. Consumer protection laws generally apply to cryptocurrencies, but some argue additional protections are needed, while others argue the current regulatory framework is overly burdensome.

* The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could impact the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy by limiting their control over the money supply. Some central banks are exploring the idea of issuing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Proponents argue CBDCs could increase payment system efficiency and financial stability.

* Critics argue CBDCs are unnecessary given existing electronic payment systems, would reduce bank lending, and could increase financial instability by facilitating runs on private banks. There is also disagreement over whether CBDCs would enhance or diminish central banks' ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. The future role and impact of cryptocurrencies and CBDCs remain highly uncertain.

* Policymakers will likely face various issues related to cryptocurrencies, including their potential use in criminal activity, the adequacy of consumer protections, the appropriate level of industry regulation, and their impact on monetary policy.

The changes would limit proposed modifications to CBAs to span no more than 2 years, provide only minimal savings needed for the debtor to exit bankruptcy, and not disproportionately burden the labor group compared to other stakeholders.

* The bill would require the court to find the parties have reached an impasse unlikely to result in agreement before approving rejection, consider the representative's counterproposals, and presume the labor group is overly burdened if the debtor gave bonuses or incentives to management. It would allow labor groups to engage in self-help like striking if a CBA is rejected or modified by the court.

The act now makes it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase plants taken or exported in violation of U.S. or foreign laws.

* The 2008 amendments require importers to submit a declaration with information on the species, value, quantity, and country of origin of plants. Implementation of the declaration requirements was phased in and reviewed, with a report sent to Congress in 2013 discussing issues such as identifying species and country of harvest. APHIS is receiving approximately 40,000 declarations per month.

Funding for enforcement comes from discretionary appropriations and the agencies' budgets. In FY2012, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement conducted 2,474 investigations related to the Lacey Act.

* Some argue the 2008 amendments overreach by addressing foreign laws not directly related to conservation, while others defend their legitimacy in reducing illegal logging. The economic impact is debated, with potential costs for importers to exercise due care and comply with declarations, and potential benefits from increased revenues for legal logging.

* The farming business is cyclical, with exaggerated price swings that are destabilizing. Farmers boost output in response to high prices but are slow to cut back production when prices drop, often operating at a loss. Factors contributing to the unstable farm economy include weather, export demand, currency fluctuations, and foreign farm support and export subsidy programs. Farmers have received federal counter-cyclical assistance to support prices and incomes for nearly 70 years.

* From 1973-1995, a key form of counter-cyclical aid was deficiency payments linked to target prices, which made up the difference when market prices fell below specified target prices for each crop. The 1996 Farm Bill ended this and replaced it with fixed production flexibility contract (PFC) payments totaling $36 billion over 7 years, not linked to current production or prices. However, the 1996 law continued marketing assistance loans that let farmers pledge stored commodities as collateral for loans and repay at lower rates when market prices dropped below loan rates. The difference between the loan rate and repayment rate was the federal subsidy.

* When the 1996 Farm Bill passed, prices were high and PFC payments combined with market earnings were expected to provide sufficient income. But in the late 1990s, prices declined steeply and Congress provided additional emergency ""market loss payments"" of $19.5 billion from FY1999-2001. In 2001, farm organizations requested that additional counter-cyclical support be added to the marketing loans and fixed payments.

• Vietnam is party to major nonproliferation treaties and has cooperated with the U.S. to convert its research reactor from HEU to LEU fuel and remove all HEU from the country. However, the 123 agreement does not include a legally-binding commitment by Vietnam to forgo domestic enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) capabilities, which has been a point of debate in the U.S. The agreement prohibits ENR of U.S.-obligated materials without specific consent.

• Overlapping strategic and economic interests have led to improved U.S.-Vietnam relations in recent years, with both countries concerned about China's rising strength. Bilateral trade reached $29 billion in 2013, and the countries are negotiating a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. However, disagreements over Vietnam's human rights record remain an obstacle to further improving ties.

• In 2005, little progress was made in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue despite some adjustments in U.S. policy. North Korea escalated tensions by announcing it had nuclear weapons, indefinitely suspending participation in the Six-Party Talks, and taking steps that could enable production of additional nuclear bombs. After nearly a year, the six nations re-convened in Beijing and agreed to a joint statement of principles in September, but disagreements quickly re-emerged.

• Hostile rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang intensified after the talks stalled again. The U.S. gave greater emphasis to North Korea's human rights abuses and criminal activities like counterfeiting U.S. dollars. Imposing penalties on a Macau bank for allegedly helping North Korea launder money had a chilling effect on the nuclear negotiations.

• In August, North Korea announced it would no longer accept humanitarian aid from the U.N. and asked foreign NGO workers to leave, likely to negotiate a less intrusive foreign presence. It continued to accept direct food shipments from South Korea and China, which provide aid with little to no monitoring. The U.S. and EU suspended food aid after North Korea's decisions.

• Several changes occurred in U.S. officials overseeing North Korea policy in 2005. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill signaled a mix of toughness and willingness to negotiate with North Korea. Later appointments of Ambassador Vershbow and Special Envoy Lefkowitz were seen as delivering a more hardline message.

• Despite some strains, inter-Korean relations overall moved toward stronger cooperation in 2005. Major progress was made in developing the Kaesong Industrial Zone, tourism increased, and ministerial talks resumed after a year. However, South Korea limited fertilizer aid to the North because of its refusal to return to nuclear talks.

• Washington and Seoul's different approaches to North Korea often strained ties, though the allies held summits affirming their shared goal of denuclearization through diplomacy. To strengthen the relationship, the leaders announced a new strategic dialogue and intention to pursue a free trade agreement. However, tactical differences in dealing with Pyongyang remained.

* Equal amounts of a melanoma cell lysate were fractionated and analyzed using the same number of LC-MS/MS runs for each method.
* The MicroSol IEF method divided the cell lysate proteome into four less complex fractions compared to the unfractionated lysate.
* Repetitive injections of the 2-D method samples improved protein identifications but showed diminishing returns after 2-3 replicates.
* The 3-D method identified 22% more proteins with two or more peptides compared to four repetitive runs of the 2-D method when using equal instrument time.
* The 3-D method also identified more unique peptides for most lower-abundance proteins compared to the 2-D method.
* Comparison of the resulting proteomes showed that over 90% of proteins identified in the 2-D method were also found by the 3-D method.
* Apparent differences between the protein lists were mostly due to variations in peptide scoring, database redundancy, and limitations of current analysis software.
* In conclusion, the additional protein fractionation by MicroSol IEF substantially improved proteome coverage and reproducibility compared to repetitive injections when using equal instrument time.

• The study compared the incidence of secondary, delayed postoperative hemorrhage between tonsillectomy and submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (SMUPPP) procedures. The incidence was 5.05% (10 patients) in the tonsillectomy group and 1.45% (3 patients) in the SMUPPP group, showing a statistically significant difference.

• Although the tonsillectomy portion was performed identically for both groups, the postoperative bleeding rates differed, with higher rates among tonsillectomy patients whose tonsillar fossa muscular tissue was not approximated using sutures. Suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in SMUPPP seemed to decrease the incidence of postoperative bleeding.

• The study suggests routine use of the suturing technique for SMUPPP in all tonsillectomy patients to reduce postoperative hemorrhage rates. Double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing, resulting in decreased bleeding incidence.

* The text describes the synthesis of β- and γ-lactams using anhydride Mannich reactions (AMRs) with sulfone-substituted anhydrides. These reactions proceed via a Mannich-like mechanism through the enol tautomer of the anhydride, as supported by computational studies. The AMRs tolerate various non-enolizable aldehydes, alkylamines, and anilines, providing the lactam products in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivity (>95:5).

* The carboxylic acid intermediates formed in the AMRs are prone to decarboxylation, unlike previous related reactions. The stereochemical outcome is explained by a cyclic transition state where the iminium ion is attacked by the enolate of the anhydride, with hydrogen bonding stabilizing the transition state. Subsequent rapid transannular acylation forms the lactam product.

* The carboxylic acid intermediates could be trapped as methyl esters using trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSCHN2) in reasonable yields. These esters could then be desulfonylated with magnesium in methanol to produce the corresponding esters in good yield. However, the analogous γ-lactam intermediates could not be isolated.

* Methyl-substituted anhydrides provided trisubstituted γ-lactams in high yields with good diastereomeric ratios, suggesting substitution on the anhydride provides excellent facial selectivity. Studies are ongoing to develop an enantioselective Michael addition to provide enantiomerically pure anhydrides and lactam products. The AMR was applied to a formal synthesis of (±)-isoretronecanol in six steps.

• This study investigated tissue transglutaminase (TGM2) expression in mononuclear leukocytes and tissues from rat renal allografts during acute rejection. TGM2 mRNA and protein were found to be overexpressed by activated monocytes accumulating in allograft blood vessels on day 9 post-transplantation. After resolution of acute rejection on day 42, TGM2 mRNA levels decreased but remained moderately elevated compared to isografts, though protein levels were not significantly increased. TGM2 mRNA expression was also induced in allograft tissue.

• The study found that TGM2-expressing monocytes in allografts did not express the M2 macrophage marker CD163, suggesting TGM2 can be expressed by activated monocytes but may not be confined to M2-like monocytes as in macrophages. Levels of activated caspase-3, an apoptosis marker, correlated with TGM2 expression in allograft leukocytes, indicating a potential link between TGM2 and apoptosis. TGM2 was also detected in blood plasma surrounding monocytes in allograft vessels.

• Chronic treatment with cystamine, a transglutaminase inhibitor, for 4 weeks post-transplantation did not prevent development of chronic allograft injury within 84 days, suggesting extracellular transglutaminase activity may not play a major role in early allograft remodeling. However, the study had limitations such as not measuring transglutaminase activity directly, using a single cystamine dose, and the short follow-up period. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential functions of monocytic TGM2 in acute and chronic allograft rejection.

• Endothelial microparticles (EMPs) were produced from stimulated endothelial cells, collected, and quantified using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. EMPs were introduced into an IV bag (model patient) connected to a continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) circuit. The decline in EMP levels due to dialysis was rapid, with 50% clearance in the first 30 minutes and levels reduced to 29% of starting concentration within 40 minutes.

• The dialysate contained only 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis. The data demonstrate that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter removes EMPs from a modeled patient's circulation. Given previous evidence of EMP-induced acute lung injury (ALI), these findings support CVVH as a potential therapeutic intervention for ALI.

• The experimental conditions achieve the same plasma level of EMPs as seen in human clinical disease. However, the model has limitations, such as the likely saturable phenomenon of EMP clearance and the different relative volumes of human circulation and CVVH circuit compared to the model. Convection and pressure gradient forces were not modeled, and EMP interactions with plasma oncotic elements were not considered.

• The low dialysate EMP level and plateauing circulation EMP level beyond 40 minutes suggest that EMP sequestration occurs within the CVVH filter or tubing and is saturable. Frequent changing of the CVVH filter and conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to specialty CVVH filters could overcome this limitation and provide more efficient and selective EMP clearance.

• Clinical data generally support the protective role of CVVH in ALI management, with the achievement of negative fluid balance associated with improved outcomes. Early CVVH may prevent or minimize volume overload commonly observed with the resuscitation phase of critical illness, particularly in persons with concomitant acute kidney injury.

• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Risk factors include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, alcohol use, and metabolic diseases. Therapeutic options are limited, and HCC is relatively resistant to chemotherapy. Molecular alterations in HCC involve mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic changes, and aberrant activation of signaling pathways.

• The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor cellular MET (cMET) promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion. HGF-cMET signaling is critical for normal embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tissue repair. Dysregulated cMET signaling occurs in many cancers and promotes tumor progression through various mechanisms. In HCC, overexpression of HGF and cMET correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive phenotypes.

• Pharmacologic cMET inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC. Inhibitors include biologic antagonists, cMET adaptor protein inhibitors, small-molecule downstream pathway inhibitors, and synthetic MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). As of March 2013, promising phase 2 results in HCC are available for the MET TKIs tivantinib and cabozantinib. Tivantinib showed improved overall survival and time to progression in patients with high MET expression, while cabozantinib demonstrated efficacy regardless of prior sorafenib use.

• Identifying patients most likely to benefit from cMET-targeted therapy is crucial. Strategies include quantifying tumor cMET content via immunohistochemistry and assessing MET sequence status. Pharmacodynamic serum markers are also under evaluation. The development of companion diagnostic tools, such as radiolabeled dyes targeting cMET receptors, may aid in patient selection. As more agents advance to later-stage trials, addressing acquired and primary resistance mechanisms through rational combination therapy and innovative clinical trial designs will be essential.

* This study compared two methods for treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis: transecting the sympathetic chain at either the third (R3) or fourth (R4) rib level. 133 patients underwent video-assisted thoracic sympathicotomy, with the most common manifestation being combined palmar and axillary sweating (39.9%). Patients were randomized into the R3 or R4 treatment group.

* The operations were successfully performed without severe complications. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of satisfaction rate and recurrence. However, the incidence of moderate to severe compensatory sweating was higher in the R3 group (71.8%) compared to the R4 group (33%).

* Compensatory sweating is a main side effect of sympathicotomy, influenced by factors such as hyperhidrosis location, sympathicotomy level, surgical procedure, and patient condition. More selective sympathicotomy, such as lowering the level from T2 to T3 or T4, has been proposed to minimize compensatory sweating. Anatomical variation, incomplete resection, and high patient expectations may also contribute to compensatory sweating.

* Previous studies suggest that excising more sympathetic segments, particularly T2, leads to greater incidence of severe compensatory symptoms. Limiting resection to a single level has been found to reduce the incidence of severe compensatory symptoms. This is the first prospective study comparing R3 and R4 single level sympathicotomy for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.

* The results suggest that compared to R3 sympathicotomy, R4 sympathicotomy decreases side effects without compromising efficacy in treating palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. R3 and R4 have similar success rates, but R4 should be the method of choice to minimize compensatory sweating. Further research is needed to optimize the surgical technique.

• This study compared the results of SPECT imaging of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) receptors and myocardial meta-[123I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy with clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes. The goal was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of combined SPECT imaging in differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes (non-PD). The final diagnosis was made by neurologists based on medical history, symptoms, response to treatment, and MRI findings.

• DAT SPECT imaging was performed using [123I]-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) and the specific binding ratio (SBR) was calculated. MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was performed and the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio was calculated from delayed SPECT images. Statistical analyses were performed to compare PD and non-PD groups and assess the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging indices.

• The mean delayed H/M ratio was significantly lower in PD compared to non-PD patients, but the mean SBR did not differ significantly between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to set cutoff values for SBR and delayed H/M ratio to differentiate PD from non-PD. The combined use of SBR < 3.24 and delayed H/M ratio < 2.745 provided the most accurate differentiation.

• The sensitivity and specificity of SBR alone were 86.7% and 52.6%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of delayed H/M ratio alone were 93% and 47%, respectively. The accuracy of each molecular imaging method alone in differentiating PD from non-PD was 67.6%. However, the combined use of SBR and delayed H/M ratio with the determined cutoff values distinguished PD from non-PD with a sensitivity of 86.7%, specificity of 73.7%, accuracy of 79.4%, positive predictive value",0,"{'n_points': 7, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 21, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, predominantly in the interventricular septum, in the absence of other causes. Familial HCM is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. At least 15 genes are implicated in 55-70% of HCM, with major genes including MYH7, TNNT2, MYBPC3, TNNI3, MYL2, and MYL3.

* Troponin T, encoded by TNNT2, is a thin-filament protein that regulates muscle contraction force and velocity. Mutations in TNNT2 account for approximately 15% of familial HCM and are associated with a severe form of the disease characterized by poor prognosis and high incidence of sudden death despite only mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Most TNNT2 mutations alter the contractile properties of cardiac muscle.

* Previous reports suggested a consistent relationship between certain genetic mutations and clinical outcome, allowing classification of ""benign"" and ""malignant"" mutations. However, recent studies consider that the specific gene mutation cannot be the sole factor dictating clinical phenotype, given the low incidence rate and variability in phenotypic expression. Mutations in sarcomeric protein genes can cause different cardiomyopathies within the same family.

* In this study, DNA analysis was performed on 173 unrelated Japanese patients with familial HCM. Three reported mutations and one new mutation in TNNT2 were identified in 11 individuals from four families (A, B, C, D). Clinical features of the patients with TNNT2 mutations were described.

• For patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCLM), hepatic resection is considered the best treatment, with 5-year survival rates between 23% and 37%. The optimal surgical strategy for resectable SCLM remains controversial, with simultaneous resection of the primary colorectal and liver tumors being favorable from the perspective of less operation and mental stress. However, some studies report higher morbidity rates after simultaneous resection due to greater surgical stress and longer operation times.

• This retrospective study analyzed 86 SCLM patients who underwent simultaneous resection to determine predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage. Postoperative complications occurred in 64% of patients, with anastomotic leakage in 21%. Morbidity was significantly correlated with diverting stoma, operation time >8 hours, intraoperative blood loss, and blood transfusion, with only blood loss being predictive.

• Anastomotic leakage was significantly correlated with lateral lymph node dissection, rectal primary site, operation time >8 hours, and intraoperative blood loss. Multivariate analysis revealed operation time >8 hours as the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage. Hospitalization was significantly longer in patients with postoperative morbidity (32.2 days) and anastomotic leakage (43.5 days).

• The overall morbidity rate was 91% and anastomotic leakage rate was 50% in patients with operation time >8 hours, compared to 54% and 13% respectively for operation time ≤8 hours. Factors related to the hepatectomy, such as extent of resection, sequence of procedures, and use of pringle maneuver, did not predict anastomotic leakage or complications. The presence of a diverting stoma also did not predict absence of anastomotic leakage.

* Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare congenital lesions first described by Friederich in 1857. They are thought to arise from abnormal embryonic development of the foregut, with only 103 cases reported in the last 150 years.
* CHFCs have specific characteristics including four typical layers: pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mucus cells, subepithelial connective tissue, smooth muscle, and an outer fibrous capsule. They are most commonly found in segment IV of the liver, range in size from <1 cm to 24 cm, and have a slight female predominance.
* CHFCs are often asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging, at autopsy, or during surgery. Imaging features are variable, with ultrasound showing anechoic or hypoechoic cysts, CT showing non-enhancing lesions of varying density, and MRI showing hyperintense cysts on T2-weighted images.
* The main differential diagnosis for CHFC is bronchogenic cyst due to their shared embryonic origin. Other considerations include simple cyst, hydatid cyst, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and a rare variant of CHFC without a smooth muscle layer.
* Treatment recommendations for CHFC vary from observation to aspiration to surgical excision. Given recent reports of malignant transformation (4.4% of cases), most authors agree that cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and those with wall abnormalities should be surgically excised.

Physical function was most commonly measured, suggesting an assumption that improved physical function results from effective self-management, but the role of physical function and alignment of measures with patient perspectives requires further clarification. Some studies used unreported measures with unknown psychometric properties, limiting the ability to draw reliable conclusions.

Thirty-day-old female Wistar rats were divided into groups and fed either a control or high-fat diet for 4 weeks. Some rats then underwent ovariectomy while others had a sham surgery. The rats were euthanized at 90 days old and various tissues were analyzed.

• The high-fat diet alone did not cause weight gain, but the combination of high-fat diet and ovariectomy increased body weight, fat mass, and leptin levels. Ovariectomy alone for 4 weeks did not modify these parameters. The time after ovariectomy and the duration of high-fat feeding may influence the effects on body weight and adiposity.

• In mesenteric fat, the high-fat diet decreased IL-6 and IL-10 levels, while the combination of high-fat and ovariectomy decreased TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. In retroperitoneal fat, the high-fat diet decreased IL-6 and IL-10, but ovariectomy reversed the IL-6 decrease and increased TNF-α. Estrogen appears to influence the cytokine response to high-fat diet in a depot-specific manner.

• Despite changes in cytokine levels, the protein content of IL-6 receptor, TNF receptor, TLR-4, and MyD88 did not differ between groups in liver, muscle, or fat. The cytokine changes may have been mediated by MAPK pathways rather than the typical TLR-4/MyD88 pathway. Disruption of circadian rhythms by high-fat diet and estrogen may have also played a role.

• In conclusion, short-term ovariectomy with a high-fat diet altered cytokines in a tissue- and depot-specific manner without changing receptor levels. However, the hyperleptinemia and increased adiposity caused by this combination may promote inflammation in the long-term, especially after menopause. The results highlight the importance of reducing dietary fat intake in postmenopausal women.

* In Denmark, women planning to conceive are advised to take 400 μg of folic acid (FA) daily until the 12th week of gestation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Despite campaigns promoting this recommendation, compliance remains low based on previous studies of pregnant women.

* This study analyzed baseline data from 5,383 participants in the ""Snart-Gravid"" (Soon Pregnant) internet-based prospective cohort study of Danish pregnancy planners. Participants reported their use of FA and multivitamin (MV) supplements, as well as sociodemographic, lifestyle, reproductive, and medical factors.

* Overall, 62.1% of participants were FA or MV supplement users. Among users, 7.7% used FA exclusively, 20.4% used MV exclusively, and 34.0% used both.

* Higher age, completing high school, having a long vocational training, higher household income, intercourse frequency ≥1 times/week, and having Pap smears were associated with increased prevalence of FA or MV use. Smoking, alcohol intake, higher BMI, and physical inactivity were associated with decreased use.

* Previous spontaneous abortion was associated with a 7.7% higher prevalence of FA or MV use compared to women without a previous abortion. There was no clear association between parity or chronic medical conditions and supplement use.

* The prevalence of FA or MV use in this study was higher than previous reports, possibly due to increased awareness over time, prospective data collection, and the health-conscious nature of study participants. However, differences in participant characteristics compared to the general population may also contribute to an overestimation of use.

* This study agrees with previous findings that maternal age, education, income, smoking, and BMI are associated with preconception FA use. The positive associations between previous spontaneous abortion, intercourse frequency, and supplement use are novel findings.

• The study evaluated lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) before and after surgery, and compared them with patients receiving simvastatin therapy. PAD patients before surgery had enhanced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), compared to those treated with simvastatin. The total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and thiol (-SH) group concentrations decreased after surgery compared to before surgery and the simvastatin group. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was higher in the simvastatin group and 7-10 days after surgery compared to before and 3-5 days after surgery.

• The findings suggest that lipid peroxidation may be a mechanism through which several risk factors promote PAD. MDA damages collagen and causes accumulation of cholesteryl esters in atherosclerotic cells. Simvastatin therapy reduced MDA levels compared to PAD patients before surgery, supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in PAD.

• The decrease in FRAP and thiol groups after surgery may be explained by oxidative stress intensification during reperfusion. Simvastatin therapy did not influence total antioxidant potential at the 20 mg daily dose used in this study. The results show diverse oxidative state responses to surgical treatment and confirm the beneficial effects of statin therapy in PAD.

FIJK is a Nigerian herbal remedy prepared from 13 medicinal plants and marketed for treating various ailments. However, there is a lack of scientific data on its safety and potential toxicity.

* Oral administration of FIJK to rats at double and triple doses caused significant reductions in plasma protein levels. Assessment of lipid profiles showed that FIJK exposure at the highest dose significantly elevated plasma triglyceride levels and depleted HDL-C levels, while LDL-C levels rose with increasing FIJK doses. The atherogenic index was significantly elevated in the FIJK-treated groups.

* FIJK treatment significantly increased rat plasma ALT and AST levels at all doses, indicating potential liver toxicity. Plasma ALP levels were lowered significantly in the highest FIJK dose group. Oral exposure to FIJK also caused significant elevation in plasma MDA levels and depletion of GSH levels, suggesting oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.

* Histopathological examination of rat liver sections revealed lesions caused by FIJK, including hemorrhage, ruptured vascular channels, hyperemia, and inflammation. These findings support the biochemical alterations and are indicative of hepatic injury. The control group showed normal liver cellular architecture.

* In conclusion, oral and repeated exposure to FIJK herbal mixture in rats caused an elevated atherogenic index, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and hepatic lesions. The study highlights the need for scientific evaluation of the safety and potential toxicity of herbal remedies marketed in Nigeria.

* Preconceptional carrier screening for autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders can identify couples at risk of having affected offspring, allowing them to make informed reproductive decisions. Carrier screening detects carriers in the general population, while carrier testing is aimed at those with a higher a priori risk based on personal or family history. Studies have shown positive attitudes towards preconceptional carrier screening from healthcare providers, patients, and the general public, but it is not widely offered in most countries due to various concerns.

* Recently, some companies have started offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers (DTC) without involving healthcare professionals. These DTC tests have generated debate, with concerns about test validity and utility, lack of informed consent, absence of pre- and post-test counseling, and potential burden on healthcare resources. The current DTC carrier tests include a large number of conditions, contrasting with the more limited tests offered in traditional healthcare settings.

* Established screening criteria state that tested conditions should be an important health problem and that a suitable test with known predictive value should be used. DTC carrier tests may not meet these criteria, as some included disorders are less severe or have incomplete penetrance. Achieving informed consent is challenging, as educating consumers about residual risk and test limitations is difficult, and DTC companies may not provide sufficient balanced information or pre-/post-test counseling.

* Offering carrier tests without medical supervision may compromise patient health, particularly for carrier couples needing intensive counseling about reproductive choices and risks to family members. The costs of follow-up in the healthcare system after DTC testing are a concern, as identifying many carriers may lead to more medical consultations and higher costs. DTC companies often emphasize privacy and testing outside of insurers' control, but some seek insurance reimbursement, which requires demonstrating the tests' usefulness and scientific basis.

* Preconceptional carrier screening should optimize benefits while minimizing risks and adverse effects by offering suitable tests for important health problems, ensuring informed decision-making, and minimizing negative psychosocial impacts. Meeting these criteria is challenging for commercial DTC carrier testing.

In the AOH model, AAA treatment attenuated RGC apoptosis, rescued the reduced number of RGCs, and reduced retinal TNF-α levels compared to PBS control. The findings suggest AAA protects against AOH-induced RGC death by modulating Müller cell gliosis and downregulating TNF-α.

• In the rat AOH model, Müller cells were activated with increased GFAP immunoreactivity compared to controls. AAA treatment attenuated the AOH-induced increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in Müller cell processes across the inner plexiform layer.

Factors such as descent of the fetal head, ossification of skull bones, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios can affect the sensitivity to detect central nervous system pathology. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used since 1989 and has an increasing role in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies, particularly for the central nervous system.

* Cerebral ventriculomegaly is diagnosed when the maximal diameter of the atrium of the lateral ventricles exceeds 10 mm, and can be classified as mild (10-12 mm), moderate (12-15 mm), or severe (> 15 mm). Measurement of the lateral ventricle is subject to errors, so precise definition of reference planes and anatomical landmarks is important. Ventriculomegaly has a wide range of causes, including imbalance between production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, abnormal cerebral development, and destructive disease processes.

* The incidence of additional anomalies with ventriculomegaly can be up to 70-85%, depending on the severity and study population.

• The gut microbiome plays a role in host metabolism and adiposity. Germ-free mice are protected from diet-induced obesity compared to conventionally raised mice, suggesting the microbiota is involved in harvesting energy from the diet. Shifts in the proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes have been observed in obese humans and mice, though the findings in humans are less clear.

There are several types of biomarkers, including DNA biomarkers, DNA tumor biomarkers, and general biomarkers like RNA, protein, or metabolite levels.

* DNA biomarkers are germline markers like SNPs, STRs, deletions or insertions that are stable over a person's lifetime, making them useful for both prospective and retrospective studies using biobanks. In contrast, DNA tumor biomarkers and general biomarkers may change over time and cannot be used for monitoring therapy response. Careful consideration must be given to factors like the timing and method of sample collection, processing and storage for these biomarker types.

* The process of biomarker development can be divided into several phases, from initial discovery using high-throughput technologies, to assay development and validation, retrospective validation, prospective validation, and finally studies assessing the impact on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Retrospective validation using biobanks may be considered ""prospective"" for DNA biomarkers if the biobank has not been used for prior biomarker studies, but clear standards are needed. Prospective clinical trials are required for tumor DNA and general biomarkers.

* Predictive biomarkers that identify patients likely to respond to a particular therapy should be validated in parallel with drug development. The FDA has issued guidance on ""companion diagnostics"" that are essential for safe and effective use of a drug. Study designs for co-development of drugs and companion diagnostics include enrichment designs that only randomize biomarker-positive patients, and biomarker-stratified designs that randomize all patients but assess treatment effects separately in biomarker-positive and negative groups.

* Ultimately, the clinical utility of a biomarker depends on whether testing improves patient outcomes compared to standard non-biomarker-based treatment selection. Adaptive trial designs and ""individual profile"" designs comparing biomarker-guided treatment assignment to conventional treatment assignment are promising approaches. However, these designs pose challenges in terms of",0,"{'n_points': 6, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '*'}"

• Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along actin filaments. The motor consists of two heads connected to lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains by attaching a quantum dot to the motor and tracking its motion. The studies found that the MyoVa lever arms have a flexural stiffness of 0.0346 pN/nm, which decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium, likely due to calmodulin dissociation.

• The distal rod domain of MyoVa was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm. Interestingly, the stiffness of the full-length and heavy meromyosin MyoVa constructs was an order of magnitude lower than the rod domain and lever arms, suggesting that the lever arm/rod junction is highly compliant. This compliance likely allows the free leading head to search for new actin binding sites and enables the motor to navigate through the complex actin meshwork in cells.

Serum adiponectin was higher in non-diabetic individuals with RI compared to those without, but did not differ between diabetic patients with and without RI. Overall, adiponectin levels were higher in individuals with RI and in T2DM patients compared to respective controls. Serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were related to various clinical parameters.

The trials included 190 DFUs treated with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) or placebo, and results were confirmed in a postmarketing surveillance of 1,440 DFUs.

• Several variables were generated as potential surrogate markers of complete healing, including percent change in ulcer area, log healing rate, ratio of log areas, and percent of granulation tissue covering the ulcer area. Continuous variables were compared between healed and non-healed ulcers, and missing data were imputed.

• The breathing process begins in the upper airway and ends with gas exchange in the alveoli. When breathing through the nose, the air is warmed, moistened, and filtered, activating immunological processes. Mouth breathing in childhood can lead to pathological adaptations of the stomatognathic system structures.
• Mouth breathing causes morphological adaptations to facilitate air reaching the alveoli, including maxillary hypoplasia, posterior mandibular rotation, dental occlusion alterations, and muscular deharmonization. These adaptations lead to functional changes in speech, chewing, and swallowing. A multidisciplinary team is essential for diagnosing, treating, and preventing mouth breathing in children.
• Accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is crucial for effective treatment. Nasopharyngoscopy is considered the most reliable exam for diagnosing nasopharyngeal obstruction caused by pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia. Cephalometry is a noninvasive exam that provides data on craniofacial growth and myofunctional status.
• This study aimed to verify the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in diagnosing pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia. The study included 55 children aged 7-11 years with mouth breathing complaints. Nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry were performed to check for nasopharyngeal obstruction.
• The results showed a regular and positive correlation (r=0.52) between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry. However, cephalometry tended to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsils compared to nasopharyngoscopy. The sensitivity of cephalometry was 35%, and the negative predictive value was 72%.
• Although nasopharyngoscopy is the gold standard for nasopharyngeal assessment, cephalometry is a complementary exam that provides information on craniofacial growth. When cephalometry results are negative for nasopharyngeal obstruction in patients with mouth breathing symptoms, nasopharyngoscopy is suggested for a more accurate diagnosis due to its tridimensional and dynamic nature.

• According to pathologic features, a new primary tumor (NPT) is designated when it has a distinct histology type or changes from a more invasive to a less invasive carcinoma compared to the original tumor. In contrast, a change from ductal carcinoma in situ to infiltrating ductal carcinoma is considered a true recurrence (TR). The best way to differentiate NPT and TR is genetic sequencing, but classification criteria using molecular techniques are not yet standardized.

• Patients with NPT are significantly younger at initial diagnosis than those with TR, but there are no age differences at relapse. The rate of NPT in the ipsilateral breast is similar to the rate of primary contralateral tumors. Currently, salvage mastectomy is the standard treatment for all types of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), but there is no conclusive evidence of its superiority over conservative surgery.

Patients with NPT benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen, if indicated, to reduce contralateral and ipsilateral recurrence. With declining mortality rates due to screening and effective adjuvant therapy, follow-up care and screening for breast cancer survivors is important.

Both provide important information about visual function and are useful for assessing various ocular conditions. The study aimed to assess overall visual functioning after switching anti-VEGF treatment.

Patients were switched to aflibercept dosed per label and assessed at baseline and week 12 for CS, VA, CRT, and NEI VFQ-25 score. Mean CS significantly improved from 1.32 to 1.40 log units (p=0.00079), while mean VA remained stable (0.51878 vs 0.53204 logMAR). Mean CRT significantly decreased by 22 μm (p=0.004), correlating with CS improvement (p=0.000046) but not VA change.

* Two-thirds of patients had improved NEI VFQ-25 scores after switch. The study suggests that in ranibizumab suboptimal responders with persistent fluid, switching to aflibercept can improve CS and reduce CRT, while maintaining prior VA gains. CS may provide additional information on visual impairment and treatment response not captured by VA alone.

* Limitations include small sample size, long-term prior ranibizumab treatment, and short follow-up. Future larger, controlled studies with longer follow-up and CS assessment are warranted to better understand the benefits of anti-VEGF switching on visual function in neovascular AMD and other retinal diseases like diabetic macular edema.

First, studies have increasingly revealed ecosystem-level impacts, where a single invader can alter nutrient cycles, fire regimes, hydrology, or physical ecosystem structure in ways that affect many resident species. Second, with the rise of molecular genetics, research has uncovered frequent hybridization and introgression between native and introduced species, which can be difficult to detect phenotypically.

* Introgression from invasive species can drive substantial evolution of native species and even produce new invasive species. Molecular techniques are also used to trace invasion routes and sources, revealing that introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to detect invaders. Research has also revealed more cases of ""invasional meltdown"" where multiple invaders facilitate each other's spread and impact, as well as ""lag effects"" where the full establishment and impact of an invader occurs years after initial arrival.

* Despite the growing evidence of widespread and significant impacts of biological invasions, a small group of critics have assailed invasion biology and management on various grounds. The five main categories of objections are: 1) the problems are overblown and impacts also arise from native species, 2) introduced species sometimes increase biodiversity, 3) antipathy toward introduced species is xenophobic, 4) the spread of invasions is inevitable in the face of globalization, and 5) control methods used against invasive animals are inhumane. The key ecological criticisms are points 1 and 4.

• This study compared the biomechanical stability of short-segment posterior pedicle screw fixation for unstable burst fractures using monoaxial or polyaxial screws, with or without intermediate screws at the fracture level. Twelve calf lumbar spine specimens were used to create L3 burst fracture models. The specimens were divided into monoaxial pedicle screw (MPS) and polyaxial pedicle screw (PPS) groups, and tested with 4-screw and 6-screw (adding intermediate screws) constructs. Range of motion (ROM) was measured in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation.

• The addition of intermediate screws significantly decreased ROM and increased construct stability in both MPS and PPS groups compared to standard 4-screw fixation. The MPS group showed significantly less ROM than the PPS group in flexion and extension with the 4-screw construct. However, there was no significant difference in ROM between the MPS and PPS groups when intermediate screws were added.

• The study provides a biomechanical rationale for using intermediate screws with short-segment posterior fixation, especially with monoaxial screws, in unstable lumbar burst fractures. Limitations include the use of a calf model, small sample size, lack of cyclical loading and long-term effects, and no comparison to long-segment fixation. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the importance of intermediate screws in enhancing the stability of short-segment constructs for burst fracture fixation.

• A method for electrodeposition of highly porous and crystalline p-type CuSCN thin films has been developed. By selecting the bath composition, rhodamine B (RB) molecules can be loaded to occupy up to 30% of the precipitated solid volume, and subsequently removed by soaking in dimethylacetamide. This process is analogous to the technology developed for ZnO/eosin Y hybrid electrodeposition for high-performance dye-sensitized photoanodes.

• The porous nanostructure and crystallographic orientation of CuSCN can be controlled by the bath composition. Fluorescence quenching studies indicate that hole injection occurs from the excited state of adsorbed dyes like RB and fluorescein isothiocyanate to the valence band of CuSCN, making these films suitable as dye-sensitized photocathodes.

• The porous crystalline CuSCN thin films exhibit photocathodic behavior in photoelectrochemical cells, but the photocurrent is limited by dye desorption and the lack of suitable stable hole-injecting dyes and redox electrolytes. Overcoming these challenges and combining efficient dye-sensitized CuSCN photocathodes with existing photoanodes could enable high-efficiency tandem dye-sensitized solar cells with a simple structure.

• Gallstones affect approximately 20 million people in the US, with 1 million new cases diagnosed annually. Treatment of cholelithiasis is the most costly digestive disease, estimated at over $5 billion per year. In 1992, the National Institutes of Health held a consensus conference on the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The panel concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offered significant advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy without increased morbidity or mortality.

• Due to reduced pain and disability, the conference determined that treatment costs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy would be equal to or slightly less than open cholecystectomy. There would also be substantial savings to patients and society from the shortened disability period. However, traditional cost appraisal methods do not generally measure the disability and lost income following standard open cholecystectomy, which have been greatly reduced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Business and patients, who are most impacted, should request this type of cost analysis.

• Surprisingly, charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy, despite the reduced length of stay, nursing, and hospital support required by open cholecystectomy. The excess charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy are likely explained by the charges for equipment and other technical requirements of laparoscopic procedures. Surgeons at Maricopa Medical Center identified excessive length of stay and charges for cholecystectomy compared to 16 other regional hospitals. Reducing conversion rates or costs for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were the only options to lower charges.

• To precisely estimate laparoscopic charges, matched pair comparisons of charges between open cholecystectomy and converted laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed using the same database. By matching age, sex, and similar diagnoses, many confounding variables were eliminated. The only reason for increased charges was attributed to the laparoscopy, as complications and concomitant diseases were excluded. This comparison provided a straightforward statistical method to determine the charges for laparoscopy.

• In general, combination therapies were more effective than single therapies in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction, with triple therapy (Capt+Los+RU) being equal to or the most effective in both normal and diabetic hearts.
• RU alone was highly effective in normal hearts, whereas in diabetic hearts it was only effective when given before ischemia for certain cardiac parameters.
• The effectiveness of drugs appeared to be cardiac parameter specific, with some drugs being better at improving certain functions over others.
• Drugs rapidly improved cardiac function within the first 10 minutes of reperfusion, followed by steady improvement up to 30 minutes, with some differences in which specific cardiac parameters showed rapid recovery.
• Possible mechanisms of RU's beneficial effects include blockade of aldosterone-induced oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and abnormal calcium handling in the heart and coronary vasculature.
• In diabetic patients, RU may be particularly useful as it does not affect glomerular filtration rate, and its addition to ACE inhibitors and ARBs may allow dose reduction of the latter agents to minimize adverse effects.
• The study suggests that in normal patients, RU alone could be an effective preventative therapy, while ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs may be the drugs of choice for diabetics when administered after ischemia.
• MR antagonists may represent a novel class of RAAS inhibitor that could overcome limitations of ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations.
• Optimal usage of drugs alone or in combination may require selection based on relative benefit in normal versus pathological states, prevention versus treatment strategies, specific cardiac parameters needing improvement, and desired rate of cardiac function recovery.

• Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in many developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths, and its incidence is increasing. Ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) were proved in several observational and experimental studies. Their lipid lowering, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects have been observed.

• Low-grade chronic inflammation is recognized as a prominent process in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. In physiological conditions, endothelial cells maintain a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules, but in atherosclerosis this balance is disrupted, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines can induce oxidative stress by enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species by immune cells. PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response.

• The human body can produce almost all fatty acids except linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA), which are essential fatty acids that must be obtained from the diet. Endogenous conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is limited in humans. Fish is the major food source of long-chain n-3 PUFAs including EPA, DHA, and DPA, while ALA is mainly found in plant sources. A balanced intake of ALA and LA as precursors or their longer-chain products EPA, DHA, and AA is required.

• Rudolf Virchow, a 19th century Prussian physician-scientist, proposed that cancer arises from normal cells in response to chronic inflammation. Throughout the 20th century, evidence accumulated that gastric cancers tend to arise in stomachs affected by chronic inflammation, especially atrophic gastritis.

• Pelayo Correa, a pathologist from Colombia, devoted his career to understanding the etiology of gastric cancer. In 1975, Correa et al. published a model hypothesizing that intestinal-type gastric cancer develops through a stepwise progression from chronic atrophic gastritis to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over 30-50 years.

• Robin Warren, an Australian pathologist, and Barry Marshall discovered Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the stomachs of patients with peptic ulcers and gastritis. Although they did not directly investigate H. pylori's role in gastric cancer, they speculated it might be involved in these diseases.

• Initial studies in the 1980s and early 1990s provided inconsistent evidence for a link between H. pylori and gastric cancer. However, three large cohort studies with nested case-controls found significantly higher rates of prior H. pylori infection in subjects who later developed gastric cancer, leading the World Health Organization to classify H. pylori as a definite carcinogen in 1994.

• Subsequent research confirmed that H. pylori is a strong risk factor for both intestinal and diffuse subtypes of noncardia gastric cancer. Measuring H. pylori exposure by more sensitive methods like CagA antibodies reveals an even higher risk than previously appreciated.

• Meta-analyses of H. pylori eradication studies indicate that eradication decreases gastric cancer risk by approximately 40% for primary prevention and 54% for tertiary prevention (preventing second cancers). The number needed to treat to prevent one gastric cancer case may range from 15 in high-risk Chinese men to 245 in low-risk American women.

• There is growing interest in population-based H. pylori screening and eradication in high-risk regions, which could greatly reduce gastric cancer burden. However, this approach is controversial",0,"{'n_points': 9, 'n_sentences_per_point': 2, 'n_sentences_total': 18, 'symbol': '•'}"

* Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious complication of pregnancy that can lead to maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. The presence of proteinuria in women with gestational hypertension is used to clinically diagnose PE. However, several studies have shown that proteinuria is not a significant predictor of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The incidence of PE has increased in China after the opening of the two-child policy, but there is no indicator of severe PE.

* Hypoalbuminemia, which occurs mainly due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged and increased permeability of vascular endothelial cells, may serve as an indicator of PE severity. This intravascular dehydration may accelerate intravascular lesions, a predisposing factor for HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Additionally, the reduction of hepatic blood flow decreases albumin production.

• The development of a monoclonal antibody (Avastin) that inhibits VEGF-A and small-molecule inhibitors of VEGF receptors has enabled targeting the VEGF-A signaling pathway in cancer. However, the recent withdrawal of Avastin for treating breast cancer has highlighted the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments and the need for careful cost-benefit analysis.

• Other VEGF family members like VEGF-C, VEGF-D and PlGF may promote resistance to Avastin by providing alternative ligands for VEGF receptors. VEGF-C and VEGF-D in particular can bind VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 to promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

• Opportunities for targeting the VEGF-C/VEGF-D signaling pathways include monoclonal antibodies that block ligand binding to VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors of these receptors, and soluble VEGFR-3 that sequesters the ligands. Targeting VEGF-D signaling could inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis to restrict tumor growth and metastasis.

• Agents targeting other VEGF family members, in combination with Avastin, may improve clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Genome-wide approaches using siRNA technology could help strategize effective targeting of the complex signaling networks driving angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and drug resistance.

• While expensive drugs like Avastin allow treatment of specific cancers in the Western world, the ability to repurpose inexpensive off-patent small molecules with known biological effects, such as aspirin, could provide a cost-effective, preventative approach to cancer in Asian countries.

Deliberate implementation of control measures has substantially reduced malaria incidence in Iran in recent years, with cases decreasing from 11,460 in 2008 to 3,239 in 2011. Iran entered the malaria pre-elimination program in 2009, employing strategies such as prevention, active case detection, and timely treatment of patients in all endemic areas.

• To achieve malaria elimination, early recognition of all parasite carriers, including those with various symptoms and parasite rates, is crucial. Active surveillance using precise laboratory methods in endemic areas is essential for detecting all kinds of infections, especially asymptomatic ones with low parasite densities. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infections has been determined using different laboratory techniques in various endemic countries.

• Light microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears remains the standard laboratory method for malaria diagnosis due to its specificity and ability to quantify parasitemia levels. However, the reliability of light microscopy is limited due to associated limitations. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used in remote settings where microscopic diagnosis is impractical or unfeasible, and as a complementary method for confirming parasite-infected cases.

• The usefulness of molecular methods such as nested-PCR has been emphasized as a highly sensitive means of detecting malaria, particularly in sub-clinical parasitemia levels. This study aimed to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections using three diagnostic tests (microscopy, RDT, and nested-PCR) in the low transmission region of Bagh-e-Malek in Minab district, Hormozgan province, southern Iran.

PVDF films were coated with an acrylic polymer and bonelike particles, and implanted in osteotomies in a sheep model. The films were actuated with an alternating sinusoidal current, generating displacements of around 700 nm. Histological and histomorphometric analyses were performed on the surrounding bone tissue.

• Total bone area and immature bone area were significantly higher around actuated films compared to static controls, especially in the areas of higher displacement. The mineral apposition rate was also significantly elevated around actuated films. Immunohistochemistry showed increased osteopontin expression around actuators, suggesting a response to mechanical stress, but no differences in TRAP expression.

Nurses were found to have limited involvement in policy formulation, with only three national nurse leaders representing nurses' issues at the policy table. Frontline nurses and nurse managers felt excluded from policy decisions and that their priority issues were not being addressed. Reasons for nurses' limited involvement included the top-down policy-making approach, nurses' lack of knowledge and skills in policy processes, and the hierarchical nursing profession.

* The health system's decision-making structures and hierarchies were found to hinder nurses' participation in policy processes. The top-down policy-making process, with the central administration mandated to make policies, limited nurses' opportunities for direct engagement. Interprofessional hierarchies, with doctors dominating leadership positions, and intraprofessional hierarchies among nurses further excluded nurses from decision-making. The public health act legally reinforced the doctors' leadership in the system.

* Nursing-centric participation of nurse leaders at policy tables was shaped by the system, which mandated them to report only on nursing issues. Nurses' inadequate knowledge and skills in policy, advocacy, research, and political engagement were attributed to the nursing profession's failure to incorporate these aspects in training. Lack of teamwork with other professionals and the perception of nursing leadership as internally focused also hindered nurses' policy influence.

* To enhance nurses' participation in policy processes, participants suggested establishing mechanisms for nurses' views to reach national decision-makers, enacting legislation to allow nurses in leadership positions, and soliciting frontline nurses' views.

• The draft sequence of the human genome promises significant biomedical advances. Biologists must learn to navigate the vast genomic DNA data to find rich veins of knowledge. Surveying and signposting the genomic landscape should guide experiments to address hypotheses about gene function.

• Genes can be annotated by integrating diverse information about individual genes, or by predicting evolutionary relationships and homology. Homologous genes often have similar structures and functions, providing clues without starting from scratch. However, homology indicates approximate function since it is based on evolution, not function.

• A major problem in gene annotation arises when homologous domains are found in otherwise non-homologous genes, due to evolutionary fusing and dividing of genes using pre-existing components. Domains are homologous sequence portions that form structural units. Several domain lexicons, such as Pfam and SMART, are used to detect domains in protein sequences.

• Interpro was derived to combine multiple domain databases, and was used along with Pfam and SMART to annotate 40-60% of the predicted human proteome by domains rather than gene names. This implies a gene product's function is a synthesis of its component domains' generalized functions. While not as detailed as experimental characterization, this provides the best predictions for uncharacterized human genes.

• Automatic domain-based annotation allows proteome annotation to keep pace with rapid changes from new genome sequence data and understanding. Most human genes lack orthologs in key model organisms, so domain-based annotation will remain important until reliable high-throughput mouse studies are available. Comparative proteomics using domains has provided insights into chordate evolution.

• Web resources like LocusLink, GeneCards, EuGenes and Ensembl combine domain predictions with other information to provide multiple views of genomes, from protein structure to SNPs and diseases, although they may not always distinguish experimental from predicted annotations. As knowledge grows, genomic cartography will become more complex, requiring use of controlled vocabularies compatible with computational methods, such as the Gene Ontology.

* Heart rate monitors have been widely used in sports over the last 25 years. The development of handy heart rate monitors with chest belts to transmit signals wirelessly has made measuring heart rate an easily accessible and valuable tool. Validity and reliability of these tools have been shown to be high compared to ECG measurements. Recent technical development has focused on real-time monitoring for both individuals and team sports.

* Four different heart rate monitoring systems were tested in the present study: Polar Team Pro, Acentas Team Monitoring System, Suunto Pro Team Pack and Activio Sport System. All systems allow direct and real-time monitoring of several individuals simultaneously. Data are transmitted wirelessly to a receiver connected to a laptop with relevant software. A direct comparison of these systems and validity of recorded data are missing in literature.

One male subject participated for HR system validity against ECG, and the female subject was involved in operating distance measurement. Due to low case numbers, the latter two tests can only be considered pilot studies.

* A quality rating system was used, divided into measurement, software, and hardware categories. Measurement was the focus, represented by 200 of 500 total scores. Hardware and software were each allocated 150 scores. Subcategories were weighted subjectively considering team sport monitoring of 10+ subjects.

* In the main field test, failure ratio was measured during a 45-minute soccer match half. Mean failure ratio was determined only with transmitters sending valid data. Distance measurement was conducted on an uphill street. Comparison against ECG was done in a lab. Scores were allocated based on percentage deviations from reference values.

* In the 1960s, McCulloch and Till proposed three functional characteristics that define stem cells: self-renewal, extensive proliferation, and multipotency. Isolation of candidate stem cells has been enabled by identifying unique cell surface proteins that allow sorting by various methods. Advances in stem cell biology have provided insight into the role of stem cells in the lung, which have been identified by their response to airway injury.

* In proximal airways, pluripotent tracheal basal cells expressing keratin-5 (K5) or keratin-14 (K14) are capable of stem cell functions. Squamous cell carcinoma, which often arises in proximal airways, exhibits elevated levels of K5 basal cells, suggesting these cancers may arise from K5 stem cells. Targeting K5 cells may provide a direction for research into squamous cell carcinoma.

* In middle airways, mature Clara cells can act as facultative progenitor cells, proliferating into diverse cell types after injury. Clara cells within neuroepithelial bodies can independently repopulate the airway after injury, acting as true bronchial airway stem cells. Small cell lung carcinomas contain cells expressing stem cell markers CD44 and MDR1, and CD44+ cells have been implicated in cancer progression via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

* In distal airways, there is debate over the marker phenotype of lung stem cells. Some studies identified CCSP+/SP-C+/Sca-1+/CD34+/CD45-/PECAM- cells as pluripotent stem cells, while others argue CCSP+/SP-C+ cells are insufficient and propose ID2 as a marker. Consensus exists that stem cells reside in the bronchoalveolar duct junction, and distal airway carcinomas are associated with stem cells from this region.

* Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common curable sexually transmitted infection, with an estimated 173 million new cases occurring annually worldwide. It has been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes such as pelvic inflammatory disease, low infant birth weight, and premature delivery. Trichomoniasis also increases the transmission and acquisition of other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

* This study was a cross-sectional analysis of behavioral and biological data from socially marginalized women in low-income neighborhoods in three coastal Peruvian cities. Eligible participants were women aged 18-40 who reported having sex in the past six months and frequented the target venues at least twice a week. Participants underwent interviews, provided self-collected vaginal swabs for trichomoniasis testing, and had blood samples taken for HIV, HSV-2, and syphilis testing.

* The overall prevalence of T. vaginalis was 9.1% in this population of socially-marginalized young women from low-income communities in coastal Peru. Infection was more common among older women, those with less education, single women, those reporting unprotected sex with a non-steady partner, and those with multiple sex partners. No association was found between vaginal symptoms and T. vaginalis infection.

* The increased prevalence of trichomonal infection in older women suggests long-term infection that does not resolve spontaneously and would be missed by screening programs focusing on younger women. The lack of association between symptoms and infection suggests that syndromic management may result in both over- and under-treatment. The asymptomatic nature of trichomoniasis could contribute to long duration of infection and continued spread in the population.

* Limitations of the study include the small sample size, limited generalizability to other populations, and potential for response bias and selection bias. However, the use of standardized interviews and the collection of epidemiologic information prior to testing likely minimized differential bias associated with trichomonal infection status. The high prevalence of this curable STI in this population supports the need for improved disease control activities.

* Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave discharges on EEG, and cognitive impairment. LGS is difficult to treat due to the multiple seizure types and frequent evolution of seizures over time. Valproic acid is considered a first-line treatment, followed by lamotrigine, rufinamide, topiramate, clobazam, felbamate, and levetiracetam. Rufinamide is a novel anticonvulsant medication recently approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS in children 4 years and older.

* Rufinamide has a unique triazole derivative structure and acts by prolonging the inactivation of sodium channels and preventing high frequency firing of action potentials. It is well absorbed orally, has a half-life of 6-10 hours, and is primarily eliminated via metabolism. A randomized controlled trial in LGS patients aged 4-30 years found that rufinamide significantly reduced total seizures and tonic-atonic seizures compared to placebo, with good tolerability.

• The WHO experts state that if rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, there is a 90% chance of passing the virus to the fetus. The most serious complication is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which is related to lack of immunity during pregnancy. Vaccination of susceptible people, especially women of reproductive age, can prevent the disease in mothers and serious complications in the fetus. The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.

• Rubella is spread globally, and before the vaccination era, outbreaks occurred in winter and early spring in countries without effective childhood vaccination policies. In closed populations like military camps or prisons, the disease can spread rapidly. However, in those who have been vaccinated or had the disease before, the possibility of infection is minimized.

• The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the RA27/3 virus strain, which induces a strong immune response similar to natural infection. Seroepidemiological studies have been done globally to evaluate the situation of protective antibodies and assess the need for vaccination. Studies in Australia, Denmark, and various parts of Iran have shown significant increases in immunity levels after implementing vaccination programs.

• In Iran, studies on rubella seroepidemiology led health authorities to add rubella and mumps vaccines to the national vaccination plan in 2003. Almost all of the 5 to 25 age group (98%) were vaccinated, and the MMR vaccine replaced the measles vaccine alone in the country's vaccination program. The main goal of this survey was to evaluate and compare the susceptibility and resistance of Kermanshahi girls at marriage, before and after mass rubella vaccination.

• The study revealed that mass vaccination of rubella caused a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibody from 20.42% to 0.7%. This finding agrees with other studies conducted in various parts of Iran, which showed significant increases in immunity levels after vaccination. The effectiveness of the RA27/3 vaccine has been demonstrated by the elimination of rubella and CRS from the Western Hemisphere and several European countries that have achieved and maintained high vaccination coverage.

• Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) using RNA probes enables visualization of gene expression patterns during development. Traditional methods using radioactive or chromogenic probes have limitations in resolution and ability to detect multiple transcripts simultaneously. Fluorescent methods offer advantages but have been difficult to implement in many embryos like Xenopus due to background autofluorescence.

• Quantum dots (QDs) are a new type of inorganic fluorophore with ideal optical properties for biological imaging, including strong fluorescence emission, resistance to photobleaching, and ability to enable multiplexed detection. However, early attempts to use QDs for WISH faced challenges with aggregation, degradation and limited tissue penetration. Treatment with proteinase K was found to allow deep tissue penetration of QDs in Xenopus embryos.

• QD-based WISH was successfully performed in Xenopus embryos using RNA probes labeled with digoxigenin, biotin or fluorescein and detected with QD-antibody conjugates. The QD method yielded highly specific staining patterns matching those obtained with chromogenic methods, and enabled optical sectioning to more accurately determine expression domains. Two-color WISH to detect multiple transcripts simultaneously was also demonstrated.

• QD-based WISH provides unprecedented resolution compared to enzymatically amplified methods, allowing visualization of intracellular mRNA localization patterns. The QD signal remains localized and fluorescent after embryo clearing, overcoming a limitation of traditional methods. The high sensitivity allows imaging on a standard fluorescence microscope without confocal microscopy.

• The successful implementation of QD-based WISH in the highly autofluorescent Xenopus embryo suggests it will be readily applicable in other model organisms. QDs offer significant advantages as fluorophores for in situ hybridization assays. Overall, QD-based WISH is a viable alternative to current ISH protocols that expands the applications of QDs in biology.

The models were well-calibrated and had good discrimination power, with c-indexes around 0.70.

* The LPDAC and EPDAC models were used to develop a web-based prognostic tool called the ""estimator"" that provides real-time, personalized estimates of conditional and unconditional survival probabilities and their standard errors. The estimator's advantages include its applicability to the vast majority of PDAC patients, its ability to provide real-time predictions, and its incorporation of additional covariates and more recent data compared to previous models. The estimator's predictions are anchored to the 2007-2009 time period, the latest available in the SEER data at the time of the study.

• Cesarean sections (CS) performed for medical reasons can be life-saving, but women are increasingly undergoing CS without medical indication, contributing to higher CS rates worldwide. The World Health Organization recommends a CS rate of 10-15% based on countries with the lowest maternal and neonatal mortality. Many studies show the actual CS rate in numerous countries is far higher than recommended. The CS rate in Iran increased six-fold over the past three decades, confirming the growing rate of CS in the country.

• The postpartum period involves critical physiological, emotional, and social changes for women that may affect their quality of life (QOL), future health, and their children's health. Socio-economic deficiencies and medical problems are risk factors for decreased QOL and depressive symptoms postnatally. The mode of delivery and childbirth experience may have long-term effects on self-rated health. Studies on the association between delivery type and health-related QOL (HRQOL) have conflicting results, with some reporting decreased HRQOL after CS and others finding no relation.

• Maslow's hierarchy of needs proposes that human needs can be portrayed in a pyramid shape, with physiological needs at the bottom, followed by safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are physical requirements for survival, while safety needs are personal security, financial security, and health. Maslow suggested that if physiological needs are relatively satisfied, safety needs emerge and may dominate behavior. He found that safety can look more important than even physiological needs once those are satisfied.

• Safety needs being more fundamental than physiological needs can be seen in examples like a deer not being able to eat when chased by wolves. Emotions serve to regulate behavior in response to threats, such as fear heightening awareness of danger and suppressing hunger. Whether physiological or safety needs are more important affects views on mental disorders. Safety needs can block physiological needs, as shown in Miller's avoidance and approach experiments where animals exert more force to avoid shocks than to obtain rewards.

• Organisms tend to be more sensitive to threatening information, processing it faster than rewarding information, known as negativity bias. This is seen as an adaptive protective strategy through evolution. As potential threats loom, the brain amplifies them and initiates responses like fleeing, freezing, or attacking. These data support safety needs being faster and more fundamental than hedonic needs.

• Maslow used infants as an example of the need for safety, seen in their preference for undisrupted routine and rhythm. Inconsistency or unfamiliar situations frequently elicit danger or terror reactions in children. This fits with behaviorists' stimulus-reaction model and cognitive scientists' stimulus-opinion-reaction model. Stimuli have both hedonic value related to physiological needs and safety value related to expectedness.

• Safety value is independent of hedonic value, as both liked and disliked things can induce a lack of safety if unexpected. Even liked things, if unexpected, can cause fear and anger. Safety is related to unexpectancy and prediction error. Dopamine neurons fire in response to unexpected rewards but not expected ones, suggesting they signal reward prediction error.

• Radical retropubic prostatectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for localized prostate cancer, but erectile dysfunction remains a major long-term morbidity. Studies by Walsh and Donker using male fetuses proposed that erectile dysfunction occurred secondary to injury of the cavernosal nerves, which were identified as a plexus of small nerves within neurovascular bundles on the posterolateral border of the prostate. Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy has led to improvements in potency rates, but there is still variability and controversy regarding the exact periprostatic nerve distribution.

• In this study, the authors examined the periprostatic nerve distribution in male cadavers using whole-mount histologic sections stained with anti-S-100 antibody. The stained sections were divided into four sectors (two lateral, ventral, dorsal), and nerve fibers were counted and measured. A three-dimensional model of the periprostatic nerve distribution was constructed.

• The results showed that the number of nerve fibers was evenly distributed in the dorsal, right lateral, and left lateral parts of the prostate, with no significant difference. The ventral part had significantly fewer nerve fibers compared to the other parts at all levels. There was no significant difference in the distance of the nerve fibers from the prostatic capsule or the thickness of the nerve fibers among the different parts, except the ventral part had significantly thinner nerve fibers.

* Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein that increases dramatically during inflammation and injury. SAA is not only an acute-phase reactant but also an apolipoprotein involved in cholesterol metabolism. Persistently high SAA levels are a prerequisite for AA amyloidosis, a serious complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

* This study assessed SAA levels in 140 RA patients with different disease activity. Positive correlations were found between SAA and measures of RA activity, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular risk factors. Multiple linear regression confirmed significant associations of SAA with CRP, white blood cell count, and QTc interval.

* SAA levels were significantly higher in men, patients with high disease activity, those treated with glucocorticoids, and those with advanced atherosclerosis or increased cystatin-C (a marker of renal dysfunction). Women treated with biological DMARDs had lower SAA levels. Normal SAA levels were found in only 7.9% of patients, who had lower inflammatory markers and normal QTc duration.

* The results suggest that despite clinical improvement, sustained inflammation persists in most RA patients and may be associated with disease complications. SAA could be a biomarker of both current inflammatory activity and chronic complications in RA, including cardiovascular and renal involvement. Persistently elevated SAA also increases the risk of AA amyloidosis.

* Perforin-deficient mice have reduced bone-marrow cellularity, eosinophils, and neutrophils compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice, even when matched for weight and age. Peripheral blood neutrophil and eosinophil counts are also lower in perforin-deficient mice, while total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts are similar. In vitro, bone-marrow from perforin-deficient mice forms fewer granulocyte-macrophage colonies in response to GM-CSF and dexamethasone compared to wild-type controls. These findings suggest perforin deficiency is associated with defective granulopoiesis.

* In vivo, dexamethasone injection increases bone-marrow eosinophils and neutrophils in wild-type mice but not perforin-deficient mice. However, dexamethasone does reduce thymus weight in both wild-type and perforin-deficient mice, indicating perforin-deficient mice can still respond to glucocorticoids in other tissues.

It is administered by injecting anesthetic solution halfway between the midpalatine raphe and gingival margin of the premolars. The technique aims to achieve multiple teeth anesthesia without causing numbness of the lip and face.

• In this study, 30 patients received the AMSA nerve block using a conventional syringe with 1 ml of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000. Anesthetic success (two consecutive readings of 80 on the pulp tester) ranged from 16.7% to 66.6% for the tested teeth.

• All subjects had palatal soft tissue anesthesia, but no pulpal anesthesia from the second premolar to central incisor or facial anesthesia. In 26.7% of patients, there was no anesthetic success in any of the tested teeth. The low success rates could be due to using a conventional syringe instead of a computer-controlled injection system.

• Advantages of the AMSA nerve block include reducing the number of injections, quantity of anesthetic, and avoiding lip and facial numbness. However, it has unpredictable anesthetic success, variable duration, and is restricted to only the five anterior maxillary teeth. The infraorbital nerve block (IONB) is an alternative technique, but causes facial numbness.

• Recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy have enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome. The genome is folded hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are units of chromosomes exhibiting higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and regulatory regions, and are stable across species, cell types, and cellular conditions. TAD boundaries are associated with enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, histone marks, and replication timing in human cells.

• The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, contributes to TAD boundary strength. BRG1 knockdown in mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells resulted in differential expression of genes related to extracellular matrix, lipid synthesis, and long non-coding RNAs. ChIP-seq analysis showed BRG1 binding primarily at genic regions and super-enhancers. Comparison of Hi-C data revealed that while most TAD boundaries overlapped between control and BRG1 knockdown cells, over 10% were unique to each condition, and TAD boundary strength was significantly reduced upon BRG1 knockdown.

• Analysis of MNase-seq data from wildtype and BRG1 knockdown mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed decreased nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions in BRG1 knockdown cells. This suggests BRG1 plays a role at TAD boundaries by regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization. The orderly positioning and occupancy of nucleosomes at TAD boundaries may render the local chromatin less flexible, preventing long-range interactions surpassing the boundary. Loss or knockdown of BRG1 may reduce nucleosome occupancy at CTCF sites through loss of its ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity or by negatively impacting CTCF binding.

* Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new imaging method that visualizes the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). Resovist, an approved MRI contrast agent, is currently the best commercially available SPIO for MPI. This study evaluated the blood half-life of the MPI signal from Resovist sourced from two different manufacturers (Bayer Pharma AG and I'rom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) in rabbits using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS). The MPI signal from both Resovist products declined rapidly, dropping below the noise level within 15-30 minutes after injection.
* There was a statistically significant difference in the MPI signal decay between the two Resovist products, with the I'rom version showing a faster decline, although no significant differences were found in their hydrodynamic size, size distribution, or MPI performance in dilution series. The rapid MPI signal decay contrasts with the slower elimination of Resovist seen on MRI, likely because only a small fraction of Resovist particles with optimal properties contribute substantially to the MPI signal. The results highlight the need for MPI-specific SPIO tracers with longer blood half-lives and standardized testing protocols, while taking into account potential differences between Resovist products until a dedicated MPI tracer becomes available.

• The authors studied the early in vivo response of liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) to Leishmania donovani infection in mice, examining both infected cells and uninfected ""inflamed"" cells exposed to the inflammatory environment. They found that the transcriptomic response of Kupffer cells infected in vivo differed from previous in vitro studies. Uninfected Kupffer cells also underwent significant transcriptional changes, suggesting activation by soluble mediators in the infected tissue.

• Comparative analysis of gene expression in infected and inflamed Kupffer cells revealed that many interferon-stimulated genes were similarly induced in both cell populations. The authors identified an RXRα-centered gene network that was aberrantly regulated in infected cells compared to inflamed cells. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity perturbed this network in infected cells and reduced parasite survival in the liver.

• The authors used an approach studying both infected and uninfected cells from the in vivo inflammatory environment, which revealed host response pathways that would be missed in in vitro studies. Targeting such in vivo pathways, like the RXRα network, impacted parasite survival. While more mechanistic studies are needed, this approach could help identify new host-directed therapies for leishmaniasis.

• For the experiments, transgenic mice were used and infected with fluorescent L. donovani parasites. Intravital microscopy was performed to image Kupffer cell dynamics in the liver before and after infection.

• The control of appetite involves coordination of physiological and environmental inputs. Early theories focused on single factors like glucose, amino acids, or fat tissue. More recent models emphasize signals from fat tissue and the gastrointestinal tract along with food sensory features.

• An alternative approach to appetite control arises from studying energy balance - the relationships between energy expenditure and intake. Resting metabolic rate, the largest component of daily energy expenditure, may provide a tonic signal of energy demand that drives daily energy intake. In contrast, physical activity energy expenditure, being more intense and sporadic, likely exerts a different type of control over appetite.

• Studies show that single bouts of exercise do not consistently increase immediate or 24-hour post-exercise food intake. However, as exercise is repeated over days, a partial compensatory response begins to appear, though usually not enough to fully offset the increased energy expenditure. Large individual variability in body weight changes in response to exercise suggests a dual effect of exercise - increasing hunger while also enhancing meal-related satiety signaling.

• Using a multi-level experimental platform measuring biological, nutritional, behavioral, and metabolic variables, unexpected associations between body composition and appetite have been observed. Fat-free mass, but not fat mass or BMI, is strongly correlated with meal size and daily energy intake, suggesting signals from fat-free mass drive food intake. Resting metabolic rate is also positively associated with meal size, daily energy expenditure, and hunger.

• Current models of appetite regulation focus on roles of fat tissue and gastrointestinal peptides in inhibiting eating. However, they do not fully explain the initiation of eating or the drive to eat. The energy used to maintain physiological functioning and metabolism, largely determined by fat-free mass, may provide the tonic drive for food seeking.

• The physiology of appetite likely involves three key components: 1) a tonic drive arising from the body's demand for energy, 2) tonic inhibition from signals reflecting energy stores like fat tissue, and 3) episodic signals from the mouth and GI tract in response to food consumption. Prolonged exercise has a dual effect of stimulating hunger while also enhancing post-meal satiety signaling.

• Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a widely used denture base material due to its excellent esthetics, low water sorption and solubility, lack of toxicity, and simple processing. However, the compression molding technique used with heat-polymerized PMMA can lead to dimensional changes and inaccuracies in denture base fit.

• Chemically activated PMMA resins are less frequently used but display less polymerization shrinkage and greater dimensional accuracy compared to heat-activated resins. The injection molding technique has advantages over compression molding, including reduced processing time, lower cost, and compensation for acrylic resin shrinkage.

• Debonding of denture teeth from denture bases is a major problem, and attempts to increase bond strength include grinding the tooth surface, applying monomer, and creating mechanical retention features. Studies have shown that heat-polymerized resin has stronger bonding to denture teeth compared to microwave-polymerized or autopolymerized resins.

• In this study, denture teeth were processed with heat-polymerized (Meliodent) and autopolymerized (Futura Gen) acrylic resins, with three surface treatments: untreated, monomer application, and airborne particle abrasion. Shear bond strength was significantly affected by the type of acrylic resin and surface treatment, with treated groups having higher bond strength than untreated groups.

• The study concluded that treating the ridge lap surface of denture teeth with monomer or airborne particle abrasion significantly improved bond strength to denture base resins, with no significant difference between the two treatments. The bond strength differed significantly between the two studied denture base resins, and failure mode was predominantly adhesive with Futura Gen and mixed with Meliodent.

* The ultraviolet radiation (UVR) emitted during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild steel was measured for various welding conditions. The effective irradiance at a distance of 500 mm from the arc was found to be in the range of 0.51-12.9 mW/cm^2, corresponding to allowable daily exposure times of only 0.23-5.9 seconds. These results indicate that exposure to the UVR emitted by GMAW of mild steel is quite hazardous without adequate protection.

* The effective irradiance was found to increase significantly with increasing welding current for both 100% CO2 and 80% Ar + 20% CO2 shielding gases. At welding currents of 300 A and above, the irradiance was higher for 80% Ar + 20% CO2 than for 100% CO2. The large increase in irradiance above 250 A for 80% Ar + 20% CO2 is attributed to a change in metal transfer mode from globular to spray transfer.

* The use of pulsed welding current with 80% Ar + 20% CO2 shielding gas resulted in effective irradiances 3.0-6.7 times higher compared to non-pulsed current. The metal transfer mode was spray transfer across the entire pulsed current range, resulting in higher amounts of metal vapor in the arc and greater UVR emission compared to short-circuit and globular transfer modes seen with non-pulsed current. Welding operators need to recognize the very high UVR hazard when using pulsed current and take adequate protective measures.

• PCR amplification using two primer sets revealed 12 isolates with PHA synthase genes, including 6 Pseudomonas strains, 4 Janthinobacterium strains, and 2 undefined Betaproteobacteria. DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of genes for short-chain-length (SCL) and medium-chain-length (MCL) PHA synthesis.

• Phylogenetic analysis of PHA synthase genes suggested some strains acquired these genes through horizontal gene transfer rather than gradual evolution. Janthinobacterium isolates possessed either phac (SCL) or phac1 (MCL) genes, with phac1 genes being more similar to those from Pseudomonas.

• Bacteria with SCL-PHA genes were found in reservoirs with low trophy, characterized by low total phosphorus and high pheophytin levels. The highest number of PHA gene variants was found in pond 10, which had the lowest pH, highest pheophytin and chlorophyll levels, and highest temperature.

• The spatial distribution of bacteria with specific PHA synthase genes in the glacier forefield is influenced by glacier melting, with flowing water transferring microorganisms to new territories. Bacteria with the ability to store and degrade PHAs may act as pioneers during the succession process.

• Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob are characterized by the aggregation and spread of misfolded proteins in the brain. These diseases have high societal costs and dramatically reduce life expectancy and quality of life. The misfolded protein aggregates create a self-sustaining, exponential vicious circle leading to disease by amplifying, spreading between cells, and accumulating in the central nervous system.

• Molecular chaperones normally help proteins fold correctly and clear misfolded proteins. However, sustained cellular stress leads to an imbalance in normal protein homeostasis, causing misfolded proteins to aggregate into intra- or extracellular deposits. These aggregates can cause pathology through various mechanisms like membrane permeabilization, trapping of chaperones, and ability to recruit soluble forms of the proteins and amplify.

• Recent evidence suggests misfolded protein aggregates in major neurodegenerative diseases spread in a prion-like manner, not just in prion diseases. Injection of brain extracts containing these aggregates into animal models can induce lesions that spread to connected brain regions over time. In vitro, the misfolded proteins can also recruit their soluble counterparts and induce their aggregation.

• There is debate over whether oligomeric or fibrillar forms of the misfolded protein aggregates are most toxic and have the highest seeding capacity. Challenges include comparing assemblies at different concentrations, defining oligomers, and interconversion between oligomers and fibrils. When compared at identical particle concentrations, fibrillar assemblies with seeding and spreading ability appear most toxic.

• No reliable predictors of HCC development were found based on individual patient data from the first clinical visit, including serum assays (ALT, AST, AFP, albumin, platelets) or fibrosis assays (biopsy, APRI, FIB-4). Cirrhosis at first visit was not predictive of HCC development in African Americans.

• The study suggests that the development of HCC in African Americans after viral clearance may be less likely than in other populations studied. Surveillance for HCC in patients with significant fibrosis, not just cirrhosis, is warranted in this population.

• With the advent of more effective direct-acting antiviral therapies, differences in response rates between African Americans and Caucasians are no longer an issue, and more patients should achieve SVR. Elimination of the virus remains the optimal goal of therapy for preventing HCC in African Americans with chronic HCV.

• Stroke is a leading cause of death globally, with most deaths occurring in low and middle income countries. Genetic factors likely play a role in the development of ischemic stroke through multiple genes exerting small influences.
• Beta-2 adrenergic receptors (β2AR) are G-protein coupled receptors that bind epinephrine and norepinephrine. Several mechanisms contribute to loss of β2AR activity, including uncoupling from adenylyl cyclase, internalization, and phosphorylation.
• Cyclic AMP (cAMP) modulated by β2AR may influence atherogenesis through effects on vascular endothelium, reactive oxygen species, monocyte recruitment and differentiation, cytokine expression, and lipid levels. Two major non-synonymous SNPs in the β2AR gene, rs1042713 (Arg16Gly) and rs1042714 (Gln27Glu), affect receptor down-regulation.
• This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between β2AR polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk. A systematic literature search and screening was conducted to identify relevant case-control studies.
• Three studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls for the allelic association and 518 cases and 510 controls for the genotypic association. The Arg16Gly polymorphism showed no significant association with ischemic stroke risk under recessive, dominant, or allelic models.
• In contrast, the Gln27Glu polymorphism was significantly associated with increased ischemic stroke risk under recessive (OR 2.09), dominant (OR 1.47), and allelic (OR 1.58) models. The Glu27 risk allele frequency was consistently higher in cases compared to controls across studies.
• Limitations of this meta-analysis include lack of haplotype analysis, gene-environment and gene-gene interaction assessment, potential selection bias, inability to adjust for confounders, and heterogeneity across studies. Larger, well-designed prospective cohort studies are needed to validate these findings.

* Methadone, frequently used in opioid addiction treatment and pain management, has been reported to negatively impact cognitive abilities in patients. Changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) are involved in controlling many cellular processes including neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. Excitotoxic high glutamate concentrations can cause a delayed, irreversible rise in [Ca]cyt known as delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), which may result from mitochondrial calcium overload.

* SH-SY5Y cells exposed to high methadone concentrations died through a necrotic-like mechanism, with methadone inducing changes in [Ca]cyt. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying methadone-induced [Ca]cyt alterations in SH-SY5Y cells. Four types of [Ca]cyt responses were observed: no rise, continuous rise shortly after methadone addition, delayed continuous rise, and transient rise.

* Methadone increased the proportion of cells showing short or delayed calcium deregulation. Pharmacological experiments ruled out involvement of extracellular calcium entry, intracellular calcium stores, and opioid receptors in the methadone-induced [Ca]cyt changes. However, drugs affecting mitochondrial calcium handling, such as oligomycin, FCCP, CGP37157, and cyclosporine A, modulated the methadone-induced delayed calcium deregulation.

* Methadone treatment caused mitochondria to become shorter and more fragmented in a dose-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y cells. The effects of FCCP and methadone on mitochondrial calcium uptake were comparable, although more pronounced with glutamate/malate as the respiratory substrate. Methadone's effect on mitochondrial calcium uptake may depend on the respiratory substrates.

* Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), the removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, is a cancer prevention strategy used by many women who carry germline mutations in the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes (BRCA1/2). However, the magnitude of the risk reductions in women with BRCA1/2 mutations who have undergone RRSO compared to those who have not is unclear. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted, pooling results from 10 published reports of RRSO and the risks of breast and/or ovarian or fallopian tube cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. RRSO was found to be strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

* The summary risk reduction estimates should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies. Data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO. To identify all reports of RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the researchers searched the PubMed database and evaluated the full text of citations to identify articles presenting primary data that provided estimates of risk reduction due to RRSO. No publications were excluded based on quality, sample size, language of publication, or other objective criteria related to study design and analysis.

* This study investigated the expression and regulatory role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in oral lichen planus (OLP). Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR analyses revealed overexpression of IL-23 and IL-17 in OLP lesions compared to normal oral mucosa. The expressions of IL-23 and IL-17 were positively correlated in reticular OLP lesions.

* In vitro experiments showed that IL-23 stimulation significantly increased the percentage of Th17 cells and IL-17 production in CD4+ T cells from OLP patients. IL-17 stimulation selectively upregulated the mRNA expressions of hBD-2, hBD-3, IL-8, CCL-20, and TNF-α, but not hBD-1, CXCL-9, CXCL-10, CXCL-11, CCL-5, or IL-6 in oral keratinocytes. These findings suggest that the IL-23/IL-17 axis may play a role in the crosstalk between keratinocytes and CD4+ T cells in OLP pathogenesis.

* The authors propose a model for the involvement of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in OLP: keratinocytes produce IL-23, which promotes Th17 cell accumulation and IL-17 overproduction in OLP lesions. IL-17 then induces keratinocytes to selectively produce various inflammatory mediators, contributing to the complex immune network in OLP. Further research is needed to explore the intrinsic mechanisms and regulatory effects of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in OLP.

Many academic investigators lack the skills and motivation to think beyond their research to address commercial issues. As a result, many promising technologies languish in the lab without a clear path to commercialization.

* Universities and academic medical centers need to better prepare and support investigators interested in translating research into practice.

* This study investigated the usefulness of Dolotest as a screening tool for depression in 715 adult primary care patients in Denmark. Dolotest is a validated assessment tool that measures pain intensity and its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using 8 visual analog scales. The study found that 34.4% of patients visited primary care due to a pain problem, and 16.1% of all patients met criteria for depression using the Major Depression Inventory scale. The prevalence of depression was significantly higher in patients visiting due to pain compared to other reasons.

* Patients meeting depression criteria scored significantly worse on all Dolotest domains compared to those not meeting depression criteria. A cut-off score of 65 on the ""low spirits"" domain provided a sensitivity of 0.78, specificity of 0.95, and positive predictive value of 0.74 for detecting patients meeting depression criteria. The study highlights the importance of screening for the co-occurrence of pain and depression, as it is associated with reduced function, work capacity, increased opioid misuse risk, and healthcare costs if not properly treated.

* The visual Dolotest profiles can facilitate awareness and communication about the co-existence of pain and depression between patients and healthcare providers. Existing depression diagnostic tools like HADS, BDI, and MDI do not include pain, increasing the risk of not identifying this important co-occurrence. Treating both pain and depression simultaneously is crucial for achieving the best possible HRQoL outcomes.

* The study's strengths include its representativeness of the Danish population due to the country's universal healthcare system and the inclusion of both urban and rural patients. Limitations include the self-reported nature of the Dolotest and MDI scores and the lack of further examination to confirm depression diagnoses. Overall, Dolotest proved to be an easy-to-use screening tool for identifying patients with co-occurring pain and depression, enabling individualized treatment plans to optimize HRQoL.

The study analyzed the synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV genomes and found that all preferred codons end with A/U. Nucleotide composition is the main force affecting codon usage bias in HMPV.

• HMPV genomes have stable effective number of codons (ENC) values, suggesting conserved genomic compositions. Correlation analysis reveals that nucleotide constraint, especially U3% and GC3%, plays a significant role in shaping the synonymous codon usage bias. Correspondence analysis shows that different HMPV genotypes have distinct codon usage biases, which may reflect differences in viral replication and virulence. The ENC-GC3% plot indicates that mutation pressure is the primary factor influencing codon usage bias in HMPV.

• HMPV exhibits a complementary codon usage pattern compared to its human host, with only one shared preferred codon. This complementary trend benefits virus replication and may contribute to persistent infection in humans. Phylogenetic differences and host factors also influence the codon usage bias in HMPV.

Given the chronic impairments faced by those with SMI, it was hypothesized that using a health home within the mental health clinic where these individuals receive the majority of their care would be ideal to maximize exposure to health home services. A case study presents preliminary results on a new ""behavioral health home"" (BHH) that used population-based care to identify abnormal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and clarify the severity of findings to permit enhanced, individualized interventions for individuals with SMI.

• The BHH was embedded in the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, consisting of outpatient mental health clinics, assertive community treatment teams, and a psychiatric rehabilitation program, serving 2000 individuals annually. Referrals were made for patients requiring the most assistance, determined by selecting persons with SMI enrolled in more intensive services. The BHH provided a minimum of 2 services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager, including care coordination, transitional care, and health promotion.

• A population-based health management program was created to target highly prevalent somatic conditions for individuals with SMI, such as diabetes and hypertension. Monitoring a specific health condition for several consecutive months provided a better understanding of the population's care needs and impact of interventions. Patients who did not have their HbA1c level drawn within 6 months were identified as not in compliance with clinic recommendations for individuals prescribed atypical antipsychotics.

• Of the 120 patients enrolled, 54 (45%) were identified as not having HbA1c levels drawn per the clinic's recommended guideline. 33",0,"{'n_points': 5, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 15, 'symbol': '•'}"

• This article reviews Oppenheimer's theory that men's socioeconomic position influences marriage and family formation. It discusses how her theory challenged prevailing explanations that focused on women's economic independence or ideological change as driving the decline in marriage.

• The article tests Oppenheimer's theory in the European context using panel data from 13 countries. It examines the effects of men's employment, income, work experience, and type of contract on the transition to cohabitation and marriage.

• The results show that men's unemployment, low income, little work experience, and temporary employment deter union formation, supporting Oppenheimer's theory. Income effects are strong, supporting the male breadwinner hypothesis, while employment effects remain even after accounting for income, supporting the career uncertainty hypothesis.

• Marriage is found to be more sensitive to men's economic position than cohabitation in Europe. Men with unstable employment are more likely to choose cohabitation over marriage.

• The transition from cohabitation to marriage is less strongly influenced by men's economic position. This may be because the cost of setting up a household matters less for this transition, and because women's economic position is unobserved.

• The influence of men's employment and income on union formation is weaker in more gender egalitarian societies than in traditional societies. This suggests men's economic status matters less when the costs of forming a household are more often shared.

• The article concludes by calling for greater attention to the role of women's economic prospects in marriage timing. It proposes that certainty in either the man's or woman's career, or in both partners' careers, may be important for transitions to committed unions.

* Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength leading to increased fracture risk, reflecting the integration of bone mass and bone quality. Bone is continually adapting to changes in its mechanical and hormonal environment via bone remodeling, which maintains bone structure and mechanical competence. Diseases and drugs that impact bone cells and remodeling influence bone structure and fracture resistance.

* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease affecting the myelin sheath of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, leading to various functional impairments. Impaired mobility or lack of weight-bearing activity reduces mechanical stress on bone, causing imbalance in bone remodeling. Management of MS often requires long-term glucocorticoids, further negatively affecting bone remodeling and strength.

* Studies have shown that patients with MS have lower bone mineral density (BMD) compared to healthy controls, with vertebral BMD being less affected than femoral BMD. Patients with progressive forms of MS showed more severe BMD loss than those with relapsing-remitting MS. Fracture rates were also higher in MS patients compared to controls.

* The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in MS include progressive immobilization, long-term glucocorticoid treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly the presence of various cytokines involved in MS pathogenesis. Chronic use of antidepressants may also contribute to osteoporosis and fractures. Functional impairments and increased fall risk, combined with bone loss and impaired bone quality, further increase fracture frequency in MS.

* Immobilization causes an overall progressive bone loss at a similar rate to osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency, but with more deteriorated bone structure and mechanical properties. The duration and degree of motor disability is a major contributor to secondary osteoporosis in MS, with site-specific effects on BMD. Non-ambulatory patients have lower BMD compared to ambulatory patients.

* Reduced mechanical stress on bone causes imbalance in bone remodeling, with a transient increase in bone resorption and a sustained decrease in bone formation. This is likely due to disruption of the oste",0,"{'n_points': 10, 'n_sentences_per_point': 3, 'n_sentences_total': 30, 'symbol': '*'}"

* miRNAs, including the miR-200 family, are expressed in a cell type-specific manner and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in cancer by regulating genes involved in processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
* The miR-200 family represses ZEB1 and ZEB2, which are transcription factors that promote EMT by repressing E-cadherin and other epithelial genes, and ZEB1 can also repress miR-200 family members in a double-negative feedback loop.
* Restoring miR-200c in cancer cells that have undergone EMT leads to decreased migration, invasion, and adhesion to extracellular matrix components, independent of E-cadherin expression.
* Increased miR-200c expression enhances chemosensitivity to microtubule-targeting agents like paclitaxel by repressing its direct target TUBB3, a tubulin isoform associated with taxane resistance.
* The reciprocal repression between miR-200c and ZEB1 is not always present in cancer cells, allowing for the distinct roles of miR-200c and ZEB1 to be identified.
* Decreased proliferation in cells with increased miR-200c or decreased ZEB1 suggests that the enhanced chemosensitivity is due to TUBB3 repression rather than increased cell division.

They decided to keep the LCD despite the added cost, as it was a key differentiating feature. However, the remote locator functionality had to be removed to meet the budget.

• The marketing criteria evaluation of the prototype scored it a 3 out of 7 on average. The design performed well on reducing unused buttons and having an easy-to-use interface, but scored lower on technological innovation and being inspired by the latest fashion trends. There were concerns that the radical design with few buttons could be daunting for less tech-savvy users.

• In the end, the team had to make compromises to get the cost down to the target $25 price point. This included using cheaper plastic materials instead of rubber, removing the locator feature, and simplifying the design. They speculated that a more expensive ""deluxe"" version with the bio-morphic rubber design could potentially sell well to early adopters.

• The team was generally satisfied with their collaboration and creative ideas. However, they were frustrated by the budget limitations and wished the cost information had been provided earlier in the process. This could have allowed them to design to the cost constraints from the beginning.

• Some additional market research was suggested, such as producing mock-ups of both a base and deluxe version to gauge consumer interest and price sensitivity.

• The project manager opened the meeting by discussing the goals of determining user requirements, technical functions, and working design of the remote control. The user interface designer presented first, covering the basic functions the remote needs to include like power, numbers, volume, channel, and menu buttons. She showed examples of a more complex remote with many buttons and a simpler remote with fewer buttons.

• The marketing expert presented survey findings showing 75% of users think current remotes are ugly, 80% are willing to spend more for a fancier remote, and the remote needs to be simple yet high-tech looking. She noted the channel, volume and power buttons are used most, and speech recognition is an up-and-coming feature that consumers are interested in. Her recommendation was to make a user-friendly remote that is modern and eye-catching but simple, possibly incorporating speech recognition.

• The industrial designer discussed the internal components needed like a power source, smart chip, and infrared bulb to communicate with devices. She suggested using standard batteries, a large on/off button for older users, a device selection button, and a smart chip to enable universal use. Her rough schematic showed the key internal components of the remote control.

• The project manager then reviewed some new requirements - the remote will only control the TV (not DVD, stereo, etc.), it needs to include the company color and slogan, and it does not need to support teletext which is becoming outdated. The team discussed the target user group, deciding it should accommodate a wide age range from kids to adults, with little to no technical experience needed to operate it. They determined the core functions should be power, channel, volume, and mute, with the number of buttons kept to a minimum.

• Ideas were discussed for making the remote easy to locate if misplaced, such as a ""find remote"" button on the TV or a locator alarm. Having a charging station was considered but decided against due to added cost. Speech recognition was debated in terms of which user demographics would value that feature and the best way to implement it.

• The team felt the number buttons were necessary to include and could not be eliminated. They looked at ways to incorporate less-used functions like subtitle, audio and video settings in a menu to keep the remote simple.

• The project manager Danny Wolfs introduced himself and had the team members introduce themselves. He explained the cameras and microphones in the room and had the team place their laptops to not block the cameras. As an icebreaker, he had each person draw their favorite animal on the smartboard and explain why they chose it.

• The project aim is to create a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. There are three design stages - functional, conceptual, and detailed, each broken into individual work and a meeting. The selling price will be 25 euros with a maximum production cost of 12.5 euros, and the profit target is 50 million euros which would require selling 2 million remotes.

• The marketing expert Tim presented some initial ideas, suggesting the remote should be intuitive, small, fairly cheap, brand independent and multi-purpose to distinguish it in the market. He proposed using alternate technology to infrared like radio waves or Bluetooth, and possibly including an LCD screen to show upcoming programs. The project manager noted these ideas but cautioned to also keep user-friendliness and price in mind.

• The user interface designer Juergen asked if they should first agree on the key aspects of what they are making, such as if it will control multiple devices or have a screen. The industrial designer suggested they could get back to those details in the next meeting. The project manager proposed they each come up with the most important things from their own perspective and then fit the pieces together next time.

• The project manager said the next meeting will be in 30 minutes, and in the meantime the industrial designer should look at the working design while the user interface designer looks at technical functions. He said they will receive specific instructions from their personal coaches. The team agreed to each work on their own list of what to include and then decide the specifics in the next meeting.

• The meeting ended after about 25 minutes. The project manager reminded them to be careful with the equipment in the room as they packed up to leave and work individually before the next group meeting in half an hour. The marketing expert accidentally knocked over something on his way out.

• The group discussed how to represent and store transcription data, annotations, and acoustic features in a structured format. They considered using an XML format developed by Adam that captures time information and allows cross-referencing between sections. The main question was whether to adopt this format or use the ATLAS framework being developed by NIST.

• For frame-level acoustic features, a binary format like ICSI's P-file was suggested rather than including them directly in the XML, to avoid huge file sizes. The P-file format has an established API and tools, though the name's meaning is unknown. Alternatives to P-file should also be considered.

• Querying the data efficiently was a concern, such as finding where certain prosodic events occur in relation to words and speaker turns. Perl scripts could be written to parse a flat XML file and build an internal graph representation for searching, or XML query languages could be used. Storing the data in a relational database and using XML for import/export was another option discussed.

• The ATLAS framework aims to provide a unified API for accessing annotation data, regardless of the backend storage (flat XML or databases). However, the learning curve for using ATLAS is steep. A simpler flat XML format would allow getting started quickly with Perl tools, while still having a path to transition to ATLAS later if needed.

• There was some debate about whether the text XML representation itself could be searched efficiently, or if an internal graph representation would always need to be constructed for querying. The structure of the XML (e.g. hierarchical vs. graph-based) affects how easily queries can be expressed.

• The ability to represent multiple hierarchies (e.g. dialogue acts vs. prosodic phrases) over the same word sequence was discussed. Cross-references using IDs can link words to the units they belong to in each layer of annotation. Maintaining consistency when the underlying words are edited was noted as a challenge.

• Liz proposed using a separate ""green ribbon"" annotation layer in Dave's channelized transcription viewer to mark the first word of each overlap instance. This would timestamp the overlap in a way that is robust if the underlying segmentation changes.

* The project manager welcomed everyone to the kickoff meeting for designing a new remote control. The goal is to create an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control to gain an advantage over competitors. The design process will involve three main steps: functional design to identify user needs and technical functions, conceptual design to specify components and user interface, and detailed design to implement the chosen design.

* To start, the project manager asked each person to draw their favorite animal on the whiteboard. The user interface designer drew an abstract orangutan, the marketing expert drew a cat named Caramel, and the project manager drew a simplified cow that looked more like a donkey. The project manager hoped this exercise would help in the process of designing the remote control.

* The financial objectives are to have a production cost under €12.50 and a selling price of twice that, targeting a profit of €50 million. They discussed whether it should control a single device or multiple devices, with the user interface designer suggesting it depends if the remote is bundled with another product or sold standalone. The industrial designer suggested having few buttons and the project manager proposed making it lighted for use in the dark.

* Other ideas included making it rounded to fit well in the hand, waterproof, and able to withstand shocks from falls. An original idea was a ""whistle tracking"" feature where the remote beeps in response to a whistle to help locate it when lost. The project manager assigned the industrial designer to research the proposed functions, the user interface designer to consider the controls and user convenience, and the marketing expert to determine absolute user requirements for the next meeting in 30 minutes.

* The group discussed differences in early childhood education and care provision across different parts of Wales. There is variation due to different patterns adopted by local authorities in providing early education and the geographically targeted Flying Start program.

* The Welsh Government is looking at ways to simplify the complex early years system and make it more integrated. They have pilot projects in 8 local authorities to look at joining up services and will announce a direction soon, possibly before Christmas.

* The primary objectives are supporting both child development and helping parents work, as these are seen as linked. The government wants to give parents the opportunity to work while also ensuring children have the best early years experiences.

* 29% of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, which is seen as positive. The government has established a program with the National Centre for Learning Welsh to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce.

* The childcare offer is currently taken up by many parents who were already using formal childcare, so it hasn't necessarily been an incentive for parents to enter work yet. However, take-up is increasing each month and the government plans to expand it to parents in education and training after a review reports back early next year.

* For Flying Start, an estimated 45% of children in the targeted areas are living in poverty. The program is seen as successful but the government wants to look at extending elements of it to reach more disadvantaged children outside the current geographic boundaries.

• Suzy Davies questioned why only 45% of children in Flying Start areas are estimated to be in poverty when the areas are targeted based on benefit take-up. Jo-Anne Daniels explained poverty in Wales is more dispersed than appreciated and people move in and out of poverty, so the percentage is a snapshot.

• Only 18% of Flying Start parents attend parenting courses, but Jo-Anne Daniels noted parenting support is also provided through enhanced health visitor services, the Healthy Child Wales programme, and advice from childcare workers.

Deputy Minister Julie Morgan said the government wants to support both child development and parents' ability to work, seeing the two as interconnected. She acknowledged the current system is complex and needs simplifying, with plans to make an announcement on the direction they will take soon.

• The committee inquired about inconsistencies in the amount of early childhood education and care provision across different parts of Wales. Julie Morgan explained this is due to historical differences in what local authorities have provided and Flying Start being geographically targeted based on income data. The Welsh Government is looking at ways to develop a more integrated approach and ensure quality across settings.

• The committee asked about the impact and future of the childcare offer. Julie Morgan said it's too early to fully evaluate the impact since it only became available across all of Wales in April 2019, but they are seeing increasing uptake each month. The Welsh Government is considering extending the offer to parents in education and training and those ""on the cusp"" of returning to work, with a review due to report in early 2020.

• The committee inquired why the Welsh Government ended its work with HMRC on the childcare funding system. Julie Morgan explained they wanted more flexibility to expand the offer in the future, had concerns about Welsh language provision, and determined it would be more cost-effective to administer the system through local authorities. She said the work with HMRC helped highlight the best path forward.

• Regarding Flying Start, the committee asked about geographic targeting, reaching disadvantaged children, and parental engagement. Julie Morgan said Flying Start aims to provide universal services in targeted areas to avoid stigma while focusing on poorer communities.

* The technical aspects should not restrict the user interface design, as IR remote control technology is very common. Even with new TV functions, a standard remote can still be used. The technical functions are not special and should not limit the design.

* For the user interface, a key decision is whether to target novice users or expert users. Targeting a huge market like the elderly would require a very simple novice-friendly design. However, this depends on how prevalent remote controls already are among the target users.

* The remote should have the basic necessary functions like power, volume, mute, channel up/down, and number buttons. Additional functions beyond that depend on user requirements and trends. Having fewer buttons allows for a trendier design.

* Teletext is becoming outdated with the rise of the internet, so only a single teletext on/off button is needed rather than advanced teletext functions. The remote will focus on controlling the TV only, without VCR or DVD functions, to keep the project simple and on schedule.

* The company wants to target a new market of customers under 40 years old, which is only 30% of the total market. A compromise is to primarily design for younger users while still keeping the remote acceptable for older users. The corporate slogan ""We put the fashion in electronics"" must be reflected in the product design.

• The group discussed the working design of the remote control, including using batteries as the energy source and an infra-red signal sent by an electronic chip to the TV. The chip would be controlled by the user interface. The sender would send the signal to tell the TV to switch on or change channels. There were some suggestions about using alternative energy sources like solar power or making the signal strong enough to go through walls, but these ideas were deemed unnecessary.

• For the user interface, the designer looked at existing remotes for inspiration on what to retain and perfect in the design. The goal is to maintain basic, familiar functionality that people want while making some improvements. Must-have features seem to be volume and channel up/down controls, a number keypad for direct channel access, and a mute button. A lock function, similar to those on mobile phones, was also discussed as a possibility.

• In the designer's research, he found two main types of remotes - engineer-centered ones that provide a lot of functionality but can be overwhelming, and user-centered ones that focus on ease of use. The group seems to be leaning towards a user-centered design. The industrial designer noted that the remote design should overlap with the findings from the marketing research on what consumers want.

• The project manager relayed that the remote design needs to maintain the company's corporate image and colors of yellow with blue writing, to make the product easily recognizable as being from their company. The remote should look fashionable and new. The user interface designer suggested they could make big improvements in the ergonomic design compared to other remotes on the market.

* The Children, Young People and Education Committee held an evidence session on the impact of Brexit on higher and further education in Wales. Cabinet Secretary for Education Kirsty Williams and Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning Eluned Morgan were questioned by committee members. They were joined by Huw Morris, group director at SHELL, and Marie Knox, deputy director overseeing European transition. The Cabinet Secretary said they have been working closely with higher education and further education colleagues to understand the potential impact of Brexit.

* Huw Morris said the higher education Brexit working group has been meeting since September 2016 to look at the impact in general. More recently, officials have been visiting individual institutions to discuss their preparedness for a ""no deal"" scenario. Most funding is believed to be secure until December 2020 even under ""no deal"". Research is being done on the impact on HE, FE and apprenticeship providers.

The prototype scored an average of 1.9, which is close to the best possible score of 1.

• In reviewing the project, the team felt there was room for creativity but they were limited by time and materials. They thought the leadership and teamwork went well, with everyone suited to their roles and good time management. The project came in under the budget of 12.50 euros per unit, and the team was satisfied with the outcome.

* The meeting began with introductions of the project manager Adam Duguid, marketing expert Ebenezer Ademesoye, industrial designer Tarik Rahman, and user interface designer Dave Cochrane. They discussed the agenda and goal of designing a new, original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control.

* Each team member drew their favorite animal on the whiteboard as an icebreaker activity. Ebenezer drew an elephant, Tarik drew a tiger, Dave drew a monkey, and Adam mentioned liking cats.

* The project has a budget of 12.5 Euros per unit and a target of selling the remote controls for 25 Euros each, with a goal of 50 million Euros in profit. This means they will need to sell a very large volume of the remote controls.

* Ideas were discussed for differentiating the new remote control in the market. High-end remotes have LCD touch screens with advanced programmability, but this would be too expensive for their price range.

* The team discussed having the remote control multiple devices in an integrated way, such as turning on the TV, DVD player, and sound system together with one button press. It could also have limited ability to program macros or sequences of commands.

* Marketing noted the popularity of interactive TV and games, and that current remote controls wear out easily and are not ideal for gaming. The new remote could be designed for durability and better gaming controls like a joystick.

* Industrial design suggested the remote could have a small joystick or control pad for easier navigation, similar to a gaming console controller. Many people are already familiar with this type of interface.

* User interface design emphasized the importance of an ergonomic shape that fits comfortably in the hand. A curved, biomorphic shape could allow for an unconventional yet attractive style while conforming to the hand.

• The attainment gap between children on free school meals and other pupils widened in 2017 despite the Pupil Development Grant (PDG). Cabinet Secretary Kirsty Williams acknowledged the results were extremely disappointing and concerning. She said there was no single reason, but factors like the move from BTECs to science GCSEs and changes to English/Welsh literature may have contributed. The government is working to understand why free school meal pupils were less resilient in the exam system last year.

• Williams said over the period PDG has been used, the attainment gap had narrowed overall, with the proportion of free school meal pupils achieving Level 2 increasing from 1 in 5 in 2009 to 1 in 3 by 2016. However, she agreed more work is needed to improve outcomes for disadvantaged pupils. The government has appointed new PDG regional advisers and is challenging schools on how the grant is used and its impact.

• On Schools Challenge Cymru, a 3-year school improvement program, Williams said some schools made more progress than others due to factors like the complexity of their challenges, quality of support advisers, and recent leadership changes. She said key lessons included the importance of leadership, tracking systems, teacher quality and collaboration. Many effective Schools Challenge staff have transitioned to roles in the regional consortia to spread best practices.

• While the program was always intended to be time-limited, some academics felt it needed 5 years to fully achieve its goals. Williams said schools were aware it was time-limited from the outset. She acknowledged a ""transition phase"" as it ended but denied it ""faded out"", saying it transitioned to a new regional support model with ongoing investment to build consortia capacity.

• On engagement with Professor Mel Ainscow, who led Schools Challenge Cymru, Williams said the government has spoken to many involved to learn lessons, including Ainscow, school staff, consortia and local authorities.

• There are challenges in tracking adopted children, as parents cannot be forced to disclose this information to schools. However, the government is actively looking at creating a dataset to track adopted children while being sensitive to privacy concerns.

• The latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing and a source of huge concern. An independent review is being conducted on the impact of PDG for looked-after children.

• Looked-after children are over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion. Addressing this requires a cross-government approach beyond just PDG, including getting additional learning needs support right for these children.

• The Schools Challenge Cymru program aimed to improve educational outcomes in 39 underperforming schools in Wales. The program ran for 3 years and had mixed results, with some schools showing significant improvement while others did not progress as much. Factors like school leadership, support from advisers, and the starting point of each school affected the level of improvement seen. The Welsh government is looking to apply lessons learned from the program to the wider school improvement agenda.

• Schools Challenge Cymru was always intended to be a time-limited 3-year program, and schools were aware of this from the outset. While some argue the program needed more time to fully achieve its goals, the government points out that challenge programs in other parts of the UK also varied in length. A key legacy of the program was the investment it made in building school improvement capacity in the regional consortia, which were in their infancy when the program began.

• After the program ended, the government provided resources to the regional consortia to continue supporting the Schools Challenge Cymru schools. The current school categorization system allows a high level of support to be targeted to schools most in need across Wales, in both primary and secondary sectors. Some former Schools Challenge Cymru schools have continued to make good progress since the program ended, while the government remains focused on supporting those schools that did not improve as much through the program.

• There was a transition period as the Schools Challenge Cymru program wound down and the regional consortia took over supporting schools. The government says this transition was well-managed, with a formal closing event to recognize successes and key program staff moving over to roles in the consortia. However, the program director Professor Mel Ainscow perceived a ""fading out"" of momentum in the final year which he felt impacted the program.

• There is some disagreement over the level of engagement between the Welsh government and Professor Ainscow since the program ended in March 2017. Prof. Ainscow told the committee he has had no contact with the government since then, while officials say there have been some meetings and discussions.

* Dr Frank Atherton said they need to consult on whether to choose a target for reducing childhood obesity in Wales. He advised that the target adopted in England and Scotland to halve childhood obesity was more aspirational than deliverable. If Wales chooses a target, it needs to balance deliverability with challenge.

* Gaps in data could be addressed by measuring children's weight at a later age in addition to the current measurement at age 4-5, to provide a longitudinal view. This would have significant resource implications that need to be considered. The millennium cohort study data on 14-15 year olds could also be utilized to look at the longitudinal picture.

* Dr Atherton said legislation may be one outcome of the consultation to help reduce childhood obesity, but the timing would be subject to other pressures. Legislation is one tool, but they need to deploy all tools available. Resourcing will be important and they need to look at making current programs more effective, but there may be a case for new investment.

* In terms of leadership and accountability, Dr Atherton said they will need some national oversight structure, but also local ownership and leadership through directors of public health and chief executives working with their public services boards. Accountability lies further up the chain than individual teachers. Public services boards and local education authorities should consider how effective schools are at driving healthy behaviors.

* On physical activity, Dr Atherton said it's important for overall health, not just weight, but doesn't have as much impact as diet. Making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive is key, tailoring to different audiences. Statutory guidance for schools on physical education could be considered.

* Regarding the clinical obesity pathway for children, Public Health Wales is reviewing it with the aim to inform the final strategy in October. Key elements include access to information, identifying overweight children, providing interventions through primary care/communities, and more targeted support for very overweight children. The pathway needs to be updated based on current evidence and provision gaps addressed.

• The group discussed using a scroll wheel on the remote control for channel and volume selection. There was agreement that a scroll wheel would be a useful feature. They decided to include two scroll wheels, one for channel and one for volume.

• A ""turbo button"" was proposed to allow users to quickly scroll through channels without having to view each one. This would let users skip over channels if desired. The turbo button could light up to indicate it is being used.

• Speech recognition technology was discussed but determined to be too limited for use in controlling the remote. The current technology can only recognize a small set of pre-recorded phrases. It is not advanced enough to recognize a large number of commands needed to control a TV.

• Fruit and vegetable design themes were proposed to make the remote control more stylish and appeal to young people. Ideas included making the remote banana or pepper shaped and using textures inspired by fruit. However, concerns were raised about the ergonomics and practicality of some fruit shapes.

• A base station that the remote control sits in was suggested, which could recharge the remote's batteries. Pressing a button on the base station would make the remote beep to help locate it if misplaced. This locator feature was seen as very useful.

• The remote will use a regular chip to keep costs down. The chip can support a small speaker for the locator beeping feature. The speaker needs to be positioned near the surface of the remote casing to ensure the beeping can be heard.

• A stylized banana shape made of plastic was chosen for the remote design. It will have a double curved shape for ergonomics. The exact texture and color are still to be determined.

• Traditional push buttons will be included along with the scroll wheels to appeal to a wider range of users. The push buttons will be on the side, with the scroll wheels positioned for thumb use. An LCD screen will not be included to manage costs.

• Next steps are to develop a prototype based on the agreed design. The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on the look and feel. The marketing expert will conduct product evaluations. Speech recognition will not be included in the initial prototype but may be considered for future versions.

• In discussing the user interface, the team decided on a ""command interface"" with physical buttons rather than an LCD-based graphical interface. This will keep the design simple, low-cost and user-friendly. The marketing expert noted that many remote interfaces are cluttered with confusing buttons, so they aim to avoid that.

• The team reviewed which functions are most important to include on the remote. Channel and volume controls and a power button were deemed essential. Infrequently used features like screen and audio mode settings will be omitted, as they differ between TV models. Simplicity will be a selling point.

• Current fashion trends were discussed, such as fruit and vegetable themes, spongy textures, and bright colors. The team wants the remote design to follow these trends to some degree while still having broad appeal across age groups and international tastes. Completely fruit-shaped remotes were rejected as too extreme.

• More subtle ways to incorporate fruit and vegetable elements were considered, such as using colors and abstract shapes that suggest produce without being too literal. For example, the number buttons could be purple and arranged in a triangular bunch to resemble grapes. The team agreed to pursue this theme in their design proposals.

• The Professor discussed the Aurora project and competition between different groups. There was disagreement over the use of voice activity detectors and the criteria for improvement in recognition accuracy. The Professor's group argued for keeping the 50% improvement requirement, while others wanted to lower it to 25% for mismatched conditions. The Professor felt the testing was flawed due to arbitrary decisions and data issues.

• The Professor's group at OGI is working on improving noise robustness, such as using the LPC spectrum instead of FFT and considering techniques like spectral subtraction and adding noise to all data. They are also researching a new approach called TRAP that uses temporal patterns of energy in frequency bands for phoneme classification. This requires a lot more computation currently and likely won't be ready for the next Aurora evaluation.

• Stephane observed that the C1 cepstral coefficient is not very important for recognition accuracy in their system. This led to a discussion of how to test the importance of individual features by modifying the trained models. The Professor proposed multiplying model components by constants and taking powers of the corresponding feature values in the test data to increase or decrease the importance.

• However, the group realized it would be simpler and achieve the same effect to just modify the variance of the corresponding Gaussian components in the models, without changing the input feature vectors at all. Increasing the variance would make a feature dimension less important, while decreasing it would make it more important. This would allow testing many combinations without retraining models each time.

• The Professor shared an anecdote about a company that was paid by the amount of computer time used on a government contract, so employees would just hit carriage returns to rack up time. He also told a story about soldiers stationed to watch for American spy planes who outsourced their job to a pub owner. The group agreed experimenting with modifying model variances would be straightforward to implement on their new Linux cluster.

<summary>
• Remote controls with many small buttons were hard to use, as it was difficult to see which buttons did what. Users were frustrated that they only used a few of the many buttons.
• Current remote controls lack backlighting, making them hard to use in a dark room. Backlighting that adjusts based on the amount of light in the room would be an improvement.
• Having only two discrete buttons for volume control was not preferred. A slider or potentiometer for quickly adjusting volume would be better.
• However, a slider for volume could cause problems if the remote is dropped or picked up and the volume suddenly increases to a high level. This could be startling or even cause a ""heart attack"".
• Infrared remote controls have to be pointed directly at the device which can be inconvenient. Radio wave remote controls avoid this problem and don't require a line-of-sight.

The sector had a PS17 million operating deficit in 2016-17 and expects a similar or slightly higher deficit for 2017-18. However, these are managed deficits and there are no critical short-term cash issues, but the increase in funding recommended by the Diamond Review is key for the sector's long-term financial sustainability.

* Brexit's impact on fee and access plans is uncertain and will depend on future student numbers. Five universities referenced Brexit in their 2019-20 fee plans. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales monitors universities'financial forecasts and governance to ensure they are properly managing risks and challenges.

* The council works closely with students and has measures in place to protect student interests, such as student charters and arrangements if a university gets into financial difficulty. The quality of the student experience could be impacted if there are fewer EU students to provide diversity. Baseline academic quality requirements will still be met regardless of Brexit.

* The Welsh Government has not provided clarity on the level of transition funding that may be needed if Brexit negatively impacts university income streams. In 2017-18, the sector expected PS38 million from EU students and PS91 million from EU research and structural funds. The council has provided this information to the government.

• The group discussed how to handle pragmatic inferences in the dialogue system, such as whether asking ""Where is X?"" implies the user wants to enter the location or just know its location. They debated whether this should be handled by separate constructions for each pragmatic reading or by a single construction with the pragmatic inference made separately. The current Bayes net implementation favors increasing the probability of the ""enter"" decision when words like ""admission fee"" are mentioned, rather than a spreading activation approach. They agreed they need to be able to handle both conventional implicatures that are part of constructions as well as conversational implicatures made via pragmatic reasoning.

• The team discussed the conceptual design of a new remote control, focusing on components, user interface, and market trends. For components, they considered case materials like plastic, wood, latex, titanium and rubber, button types like pushbuttons and scroll wheels, chip complexity, and battery options including kinetic batteries. The industrial designer recommended a curved case, pushbuttons, a simple chip, and a kinetic battery to balance fashion and simplicity.

• For the user interface, the main goals were simplicity and a fashionable look. The interface designer suggested modeling it after the iPod's minimalist design with a few core buttons and a menu system for advanced features, either on a small LCD screen on the remote or displayed on the TV screen. Having the menu on the TV screen was preferred for visibility and ease of use.

• Market research indicated a trend towards fancy looking remotes over the next year, with fruits, vegetables and spongy materials being in fashion. However, the team was skeptical about making the remote too trendy or gimmicky. They considered ways to incorporate these fashion elements tastefully, such as using fruit and vegetable colors or a latex coating for a better grip.

• The team aimed to make a final decision on the remote control concept. They agreed on a curved case made of plastic with a latex coating in fruit and vegetable colors for a fashionable look and comfortable grip. To keep costs down, they chose to use pushbuttons and a simple chip rather than a scroll wheel or LCD screen.

• For the user interface, they decided on core buttons for power, volume, pre-set favorite channels, and a menu button to access additional features through an on-screen TV menu. An up/down button could double as the volume control. This minimalist button setup would keep the design sleek and simple to use.

• In the last few minutes, the project manager reviewed the team's decisions - a simple chip, pushbuttons, and an on-screen menu interface in a curved latex case. She then outlined the next steps, with the industrial designer and user interface designer collaborating on a clay prototype, and ended the meeting. The team was excited to move forward with the fashionable yet functional remote control concept.

• The committee discussed a bill to ban physical punishment of children in Wales. Nearly 70% of individuals who responded to the consultation do not support the bill.
• Deputy Minister Julie Morgan said the bill aims to prohibit all physical punishment to protect children's rights, not address child abuse. She acknowledged people have different views but believes the law should not defend any physical punishment of children.
• Some parents said they use a gentle smack as part of a toolkit to deal with challenging behavior. Morgan said there are other ways to help parents and give advice on different methods.
• Statistics from Sweden showed a large increase in child-on-child violence after banning physical punishment in 1979. However, Morgan said a recent study of 88 countries found prohibiting corporal punishment is associated with less youth violence.
• The bill's explanatory memorandum says there is no definitive evidence that reasonable physical punishment causes negative outcomes. Equal Protection Network Cymru found this confusing as international evidence shows physical punishment is harmful.
• Teachers would need training on the new law and how to respond if a child reports being smacked. The government believes this could be incorporated into existing safeguarding training at minimal cost.
• Social services already investigate reports of physical punishment and the threshold of significant harm is not expected to change. Evidence from other countries shows they were not overwhelmed with referrals after introducing a ban.
• The government is exploring a diversion scheme focused on advice and support that police could use instead of cautions or prosecutions. Enhanced DBS checks could still disclose non-conviction information like complaints in a small number of cases.
• The government estimates the bill will cost £2.2 million over 6 years, mostly for awareness campaigns. Some unknown costs may arise but evidence from other countries introducing similar laws shows the impact is manageable.
• 58% of the public already think the law does not allow parents to smack children. This shows the current law is confusing and needs to be simplified through the proposed legislation along with awareness campaigns.

<summary>
• The group discussed the final design of a banana-shaped TV remote control. It has an ergonomic shape, scroll wheels for volume and channel control, and a ""turbo"" button for fast scrolling. The remote sits in an attractive banana leaf-shaped base station for charging.

• The remote uses rechargeable batteries and a regular control chip to keep costs down. It has an infrared port at the top and the base station has a button to locate the remote if lost. The group decided against including LCD screens, speech recognition, or solar cells to stay within budget.

• In evaluating the design, the group rated it highly on being fancy, handy, cool-looking, and easy to use. However, some had reservations about whether they would actually buy it themselves at the 25 euro price point. They thought it might appeal more to younger trendsetters.

• To meet the 12.5 euro production cost target, the group made some adjustments like using plastic instead of rubber. With a simplified design and cheaper materials, they projected being able to produce it for around 12.4 euros, leaving some margin for additional costs like the charging cord.

• The group identified some limitations in their design process, such as not getting direct input from the young trendsetter target market. They suggested doing focus groups and street interviews with this demographic to gauge interest in the product. This could also reveal potential appeal with additional markets like young children.

• For future iterations, the group brainstormed expanding functionality to control other devices beyond just TVs, such as DVD players, mood lighting, and other room environment factors. They also discussed further simplifying the internal electronics and researching cheaper component options to reduce production costs even more.

• Overall, the group was satisfied with their final banana TV remote design and the creative design process. They planned to have the production department create a working prototype that they could test at home. The project stayed on budget and generated some interesting ideas for future exploration.

• In evaluating the design, the team rated it high on style, ease of use, and coolness factor. However, some team members expressed doubts about whether they would actually buy it for themselves. They thought it might appeal more to young trendsetters.

• The cost estimate came in just under the €12.50 target price by using a standard chip, rechargeable batteries, and plastic casing. Rubber casing would have put it over budget. About 90 cents was left for the charging base station.

• For next steps, the team wants to get feedback from the actual target market of young people to see if they would buy the product. They also discussed possibly expanding it to control other devices beyond just the TV. Making a working prototype to test at home was also suggested.

* The team discussed the newsflash about the new remote control requirements, though not everyone saw it. The remote should be designed for a user group below 40 years old and have the company's corporate identity.

* The marketing expert presented research findings showing users dislike the look and feel of current remotes, think they are ugly, get lost easily, and are bad for RSI. The most used functions are power, channel, and volume selection, while less used ones are audio and screen settings.

* The user interface designer showed examples of an advanced remote with many options and an easy remote with fewer buttons. The team agreed they need to combine the best aspects of each and make the remote easy to use for basic functions like channel surfing.

* The industrial designer was working on the technical functions of the remote but didn't finish the presentation in time after getting the design brief late. The remote works by sending infrared signals to the TV corresponding to each button press.

* The team decided the remote should have a screen on top to access advanced functions, with the company logo also on top. Basic buttons like numbers, volume and channel should be in the center within thumb's reach.

* The remote will have a microphone for speech recognition, likely placed on the top or side. A menu button will activate the screen menu, navigated using arrow keys in the center.

* The screen menu will include options like sound settings (treble, bass, mono/stereo), screen settings (brightness, color), and channel programming (auto-seek, swapping channels). These are accessed less frequently so are put in the menu.

* The project manager welcomed everyone and reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The product was developed and reviewed, with implications from the 4 million sales target and new ideas like fewer buttons, bright colors, and Japanese influence. The project manager noted new requirements that the remote only control the TV and incorporate the corporate image, color and slogan. The group accepted the minutes from the previous meeting.

* The marketing expert presented research showing users are unhappy with current remote controls, with 50% only using 10% of the buttons and 80% willing to spend more for a fancy-looking remote. There was interest in speech recognition from younger age groups, but it was unclear if this was a large enough market. The marketing expert recommended focusing the remote on power, channel and volume, with everything else up to the designers.

* The user interface designer agreed they need a more streamlined remote with no extraneous functions. She looked at existing remotes and suggested they don't need functions for video/DVD, only channel selection, volume control, and a menu access button. The remotes need to be revolutionized in style, materials, size, shape, colors - the current designs are terrible.

* The industrial designer outlined the basic components needed: energy source, user interface with chip to compose messages from button presses, and a sending mechanism, all for under 12.50 euros. He hadn't considered it being repairable, just a cheap, mass-produced device, making speech recognition unlikely in that price range. Solar power was suggested but deemed impractical; however, a rechargeable internal battery with a docking station was considered as a potential selling point if feasible cost-wise.

* The team discussed the target market, wondering if the younger demographic buying personal electronics are the ones buying TV remotes or if it's better to sell the remotes through TV manufacturers. They agreed to focus on making the remote attractive and user-friendly with big buttons. The industrial designer questioned if special functions like using the power button also as an enter key would be too complicated for older users.

* In discussing which functions to include, the team leaned towards simplicity, including only the most important: channel, volume, and power. Less relevant functions like screen and audio settings would be adjusted on the TV itself.

They expressed general support for the Bill, stating it would bring needed clarity and reflect the rights of the child under the UNCRC.

• The representatives said evidence shows physical punishment is harmful to children and can be a pathway to more serious abuse. They believe the current reasonable punishment defence is confusing and the Bill would accelerate the culture change in Wales of not accepting physical punishment of children. However, they emphasized the need for discussion around the definition of ""corporal punishment"" during the implementation phase.

• In terms of the impact on social services, the representatives do not anticipate a large increase in referrals, as physical punishment has become less common in Wales. Each incident would be assessed proportionately. They stressed social services aims to support families, not have long-term involvement, and many referrals result in no action after initial assessment.

• For the education sector, the main impact would be around awareness raising and training for professionals. The duty to report safeguarding concerns would remain the same. Schools play a key role in supporting families and investment in preventative services in schools is important.

• The representatives emphasized the need for a major awareness raising campaign so parents and the public understand the legislation is not aiming to criminalize parents. This should utilize various avenues like preventative and universal services, regional safeguarding boards, etc. There were differing views on whether an awareness raising duty should be on the face of the Bill.

• In terms of resources, the representatives believe the Bill itself would not divert substantial resources from children's services, as it deals with a small number of cases. However, any additional costs for training, awareness raising etc. across agencies should be met by the Welsh Government, as it is their legislation. Work is underway to try to quantify the potential costs.

The representatives said the defence of reasonable punishment is rarely used currently and the Bill represents a natural progression in how children are cared for in Wales.

* The representatives said evidence shows physical punishment is harmful to children and can be a pathway to more serious abuse. While incidents of physical punishment have declined, they argued legislation should reflect society's values. Passing the Bill could accelerate awareness and cultural change in how children are cared for.

* In response to concerns the Bill could criminalize parents, the representatives emphasized proportionate responses would be used. They said the Bill aims to protect vulnerable children, provide clarity on acceptable discipline, and offer support to parents who are struggling. Most parents would not face long-term intervention from social services.

* The representatives said if the Bill passes, they would encourage the public to report incidents of children being physically punished. However, not every report would lead to an investigation or meet the threshold for social services involvement. Each case would be assessed proportionately by qualified professionals.

* The committee discussed whether the Bill could strain social services, which are already overstretched. The representatives said they anticipate a small, temporary increase in referrals but not a huge impact on social services. They emphasized the importance of investing in preventative and support services for families.

* Regarding schools, the representatives said the Bill would not significantly change safeguarding procedures, as school staff already have a duty to report suspected significant harm. Some additional training and awareness-raising for education professionals would be needed. Schools play a key role in identifying concerns and supporting families.

* The representatives stressed the importance of a public awareness campaign so parents understand the Bill aims to protect children, not criminalize parents.

• The witnesses expressed general support for the Bill, saying it would bring needed clarity for children, parents and professionals. They said the current law is ineffective and unclear, and the Bill reflects the rights of children under the UNCRC. The aim is not to criminalize parents, but to accelerate the culture change in how children are cared for in Wales. The number of parents who view physical punishment as acceptable has steadily declined over the past 15-20 years.

• Social services already encourage the public to report if they see a child being physically punished. If the Bill passes, each incident would be assessed proportionately to determine if action is needed, but there would not be automatic long-term intervention in families' lives. The goal is for families to find their own solutions with support, not punitive approaches from social services. Countless referrals are made currently that result in no action after assessment.

• For the education sector, the main impact would be around training and awareness for professionals. The duty to report safeguarding concerns would remain the same. As long as there is clarity that significant harm to a child must be reported, education professionals will be able to implement the law. Support and preventative services for parents that can be provided or signposted by schools will be key.

• The witnesses emphasized the need to make it very clear to the public that the legislation is not seeking to criminalize parents. A major awareness campaign using various avenues will be critical for parents and the public to understand the change. Some suggested putting a duty on the face of the Bill for Ministers to raise awareness, similar to legislation in Scotland, to provide clarity on who is responsible.

• On the issue of costs, the witnesses said more work is being done to estimate and quantify the potential impacts on social services, police, courts and other agencies. They do not expect a large surge in referrals to social services based on the small numbers of cases currently. Training costs can be incorporated into existing programs. However, they believe any additional costs incurred must be met by the government so it does not detract from current services for vulnerable families.

* The project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting, including the decision to use a simple chip on print, plastic with rubber casing, kinetic energy, and a scroll-like design with push buttons. The team also previously decided on yellow with black buttons, the company logo, and a slogan. There were some production issues, cost constraints, and conflicts that needed to be resolved after the last meeting. The team prepared prototypes for this final meeting.

* The industrial designer and user interface designer presented two prototypes - one shaped like a banana and one rounded ""blob"" design, both featuring large, easy-to-use buttons in a cross configuration. They discussed options for materials, including hard plastic or a rubber casing. The prototypes had an on/off switch on the back for easy access. The simple, rounded designs were meant to evoke an organic, friendly, and ""fun"" feeling.

* The marketing expert led an interactive evaluation of the prototypes based on the previously established user requirements and market trends. The team rated the prototypes on several criteria using a 1-7 scale, with 1 being the best score. They felt the designs were stylish/fancy, very easy to use, quite trendy, and had well-designed buttons without excess keys. The prototypes were also rated as attractive, sellable, cost-saving, and environmentally friendly due to the kinetic energy source.

* During the evaluation, the team discussed some of the pros and cons of the designs. They liked the prominent scroll wheel-like button layout, which was intuitive and differentiated the product from other remotes. However, they were unsure about the durability of a curved or banana-shaped rubber casing. They also recognized that the simplified button interface would require more programming work to make the on-screen menus user-friendly. Overall, the team felt the designs were innovative for the push-button remote market, even if they lacked high-tech features like voice control.

For the NSF ITR, a full proposal is due in about a month and will require more work in March to prepare it. If awarded, the grant would fund new research extending the current work to higher-level issues in meetings.

* For naming sound files, they agreed to make all the filenames the same length by adding leading zeros (e.g. ""MRM001"" instead of ""MR1""). This will make sorting and extracting bits of the filenames easier. They plan to take a few days to reorganize the file structure and naming while the transcribers take a break.

* PhD C presented an update on his work with harmonicity detection algorithms. He tried two methods - one based directly on the FFT spectrum and multiples of a frequency, and another using instantaneous frequency from the phase derivative of the FFT. The instantaneous frequency method showed the spectrum concentrating around the harmonics, but applying the rules from the paper did not work well and he is unsure why.

* Professor A suggested some alternative approaches for PhD C to try, such as making a sieve to hypothesize a fundamental frequency and its harmonics, and looking at the fraction of energy at those frequencies compared to the total energy. This ratio could help distinguish single speakers from overlaps. Low-pass filtering and a voiced/unvoiced determination may also help.

* PhD C will prepare all his harmonicity results for next week to discuss further with the group. He needs more time and discussion to understand what is happening with so many frequency peaks that are not all harmonics. Finding the best way to use the instantaneous frequency information is an open question.

* The team discussed the prototype remote control design, which included an on-off button, mute button, volume and channel selectors, number buttons, and buttons for teletext and subtitles. Marketing questioned the functionality of the teletext buttons. The project manager thought there were too many buttons and they should try to keep it simple with just a few large buttons. The team debated which buttons were truly necessary and which could potentially be eliminated.

* To reduce costs, the team considered discarding the mute button by pressing volume-down twice, and possibly eliminating the help button. They discussed having a long press of a button bring up help on the LCD screen, but thought elderly users may not know that option. They determined the number buttons, teletext, and subtitle buttons were necessary. Marketing pointed out that if the remote only controlled the TV, there wasn't much functionality to remove.

* The team reviewed the pricing of components and determined it would be very difficult to meet the €12.50 per unit cost target with the current design. The LCD display, advanced chip, and large number of buttons were the biggest costs. They brainstormed ways to reduce the number of physical buttons by using multi-function buttons or a scroll wheel to select channels. However, this could negatively impact usability for the elderly target users.

* Marketing was discontent with the many changes being made to the buttons and overall design just to meet the cost requirements. He would prefer to go to the board and request a higher budget of €18 per unit in order to make a remote that is better suited to the target user group. The project manager said they must find a way to stay within the €12.50 budget. The team struggled to find an optimal balance between functionality, usability, and cost.

* The team determined they could use a single curved case design instead of double curved to save €1 per unit. They decided to replace the 10 number buttons with a single scroll wheel. The scroll wheel could also control volume and channel when pressing the volume or channel buttons. This would result in a remote with just 5 buttons and a scroll wheel.

The late financial data forced the team to make significant changes to their remote control design to meet the cost target of 12.50 euros per unit. Marketing was not satisfied with the resulting design that uses a scroll wheel and fewer buttons, feeling it would not be easy to use or appeal to their target market of older consumers. Despite the design changes, Marketing still thinks the remote will require a lot of marketing effort to convince older people to purchase it.

* The Project Manager acknowledged they should have had the financial information earlier and there was a lack of price information that restricted the design. The Project Manager noted some positives of the final design, such as the docking station and removable covers that could allow them to market it to younger consumers as well.

They also looked at reducing the number of buttons, but were concerned this would hurt ease of use too much.

* Ultimately, the project manager decided they needed to remove the LCD screen and speech recognition to get the cost down to 12 euros. This essentially meant going with the basic remote design, since removing those features from the advanced design made it very similar to the basic one. The team agreed to move forward with the streamlined basic design.

* In summary, while the advanced design was more full-featured and trendy, the team was constrained by the budget and decided to go with a more basic design at a lower price point.

Users also get frustrated by remotes being hard to find, taking too long to learn, and causing repetitive strain injuries.
• The technical functions of a remote were reviewed, with the key components being an energy source, user interface, chip, and infrared lamp. A universal remote that could control many devices was deemed too complex and expensive, so the team decided to focus on a remote for just controlling TVs. The remote should be user-friendly with a simple interface and minimal buttons.
• New design requirements were introduced, specifying that the remote should only control TVs, not have teletext, and incorporate the company's colors of yellow and grey and the slogan ""We put the fashion in electronics"". Based on the research findings and new requirements, the team agreed the remote should have an attractive, modern appearance, a simplified interface, and an easy way to find it if lost.
• Speech recognition technology was discussed as a potential feature, but the team felt it would be too expensive, complex and unreliable to incorporate. Younger users were more open to paying extra for speech recognition, but it was seen as more of a gimmick that would wear off. The team decided not to pursue speech recognition and instead focus on the remote's visual form and user interface.
• Various form factors were considered for the remote, such as a ball shape or flared rectangular design.

* The project manager led a meeting to discuss the functional design of a new TV remote control called ""Mando"". The team decided on this name as it means ""control"" in Spanish and could appeal to the U.S. market. The project manager shared new requirements that the remote should be restricted to TV only, focus more on internet aspects, and clearly identify the company's corporate image.

* The marketing expert presented a report on current remote controls, finding that people think they are ugly, worry about repetitive strain injury, and often lose them. Younger people are more interested in incorporating new technologies. The marketing expert suggested the remote should not be too small, should have a design that fits the hand shape, and could incorporate an LCD screen or speech recognition if budget allows.

* The user interface designer researched current remotes and suggested a scroll wheel for easier channel changing, similar to a mouse scroll wheel. He proposed an LCD screen to display program information downloaded from the internet, allowing navigation to programs by name rather than channel number. He also suggested limiting the number and varying the size and shape of buttons to make frequently used buttons easier to find without looking.

* The industrial designer presented a working design incorporating both traditional buttons and speech recognition to appeal to a range of users. The speech recognition would use a limited vocabulary system with a microphone. Buttons would still be included for users not comfortable with the new technology. The components would include a power switch, LED indicator, microphone, and infrared transmitter.

* The team discussed the pros and cons of including speech recognition and an LCD screen. Speech recognition may be cheaper than an LCD but could have problems with background noise from the TV and supporting multiple languages. An LCD could display program information but would require an internet connection and may be too expensive for the 25 euro price point.

* The project manager summarized that the remote should target TVs, be fancy and easy to hold, bring in new technologies for young people, and push towards using the internet. Including an LCD is still under discussion but speech recognition will not be included due to cost and concerns about guaranteed performance. The user interface designer questioned whether the 25 euro price point was feasible for adding more advanced features.

* The user interface designer and project manager discussed the design of the remote control, including the scroll wheel, buttons, and overall shape and size. They felt the power button was a bit of a reach and considered adding a trigger button by the scroll wheel, but ultimately decided against it since they couldn't determine an important enough function for it. The project manager was impressed with the design overall but noted the scroll wheel might rotate too easily if the remote landed on it.

* The user interface designer explained that the white plastic and red rubber areas on the prototype would not necessarily be the final colors, which would be determined by the marketing team. When the scroll wheel accidentally broke off the prototype, the project manager commented that they would need to ensure the wheels are attached securely in the final product. The project manager asked about the two blue lights, which the UI designer confirmed were for charging the device in the cradle.

* The UI designer mentioned they considered adding a trigger button where the user's index finger naturally rests, but couldn't decide on a function that was important enough to dedicate a button to in that location. The project manager suggested that requiring both the scroll wheel and a trigger button to be pressed simultaneously could prevent accidental scrolling if the remote lands on the wheel. The UI designer agreed this might be tweaked in the final design phase.

* The project manager asked if the red and white color scheme was final, and the UI designer reiterated that would be up to marketing to determine. The marketing representative suggested using silvers and blacks to match most televisions. The project manager was satisfied with the design presentation and impressed by the prototype.

• The Minister was asked how schools causing significant concern could be identified. She said the primary route is the school categorisation system, which is used to identify where resources should be allocated based on risk. Estyn inspections are part of the accountability system to hold schools responsible for their performance. Both systems are evolving over time.

• The Minister said a new multi-agency approach is being piloted for schools causing concern, with panels including the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn and Welsh Government working together to support improvement. Initial feedback on this approach has been very positive. The Minister wants to see sustainable improvement in these schools over 6, 12 and 18 months, not just short-term fixes.

• Regarding regional consortia, the Minister said she has been convinced of the value of regional working and it would be reckless to go back to school improvement being organized by 22 individual local authorities. While there is variation in effectiveness of the consortia, increasingly they are developing a national approach delivered regionally. The Minister is disappointed Neath Port Talbot has given notice to withdraw from its consortium and would want to see their alternative plans.

• The Minister said changes to school performance measures have been made for good reasons to ensure they are in the best interests of learners, even if it makes comparisons over time more challenging. A broader range of data beyond exam results is being looked at to evaluate school performance. The Welsh Government wants to ensure performance data is used intelligently to truly understand how a school is doing, not to create misleading comparisons or a false sense of security.

• Regarding equity, the Minister acknowledged more progress is needed to improve outcomes for disadvantaged pupils, looked after children and some ethnic minority groups. Wales has invested significantly in the Pupil Development Grant to help close attainment gaps. PISA results show pupils in Wales are relatively more able to overcome disadvantage compared to the OECD average, but the Minister is not satisfied and knows more work remains to be done.

* The text is a transcript of an evidence session with Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education in Wales, and Steve Davies, director of education. They discuss various aspects of the Welsh education system and efforts to improve school standards. The discussion covers topics such as the role of the OECD in reviewing progress, powers of intervention in underperforming schools, and a new national evaluation and improvement resource.

* The Minister states that while local authorities have powers to intervene in schools, there is a mixed picture in terms of them using those powers. A new multi-agency approach is being piloted for schools causing concern, with panels including the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn, and Welsh Government working together to support improvement. The Minister believes earlier intervention is needed to prevent schools from going into special measures.

* There is discussion about the role and effectiveness of the four regional education consortia in Wales. The Minister has been convinced of the value of regional working in the absence of local government reform, though there is variation in performance between the consortia. Neath Port Talbot council has given notice of wanting to withdraw from ERW consortium, which the Minister finds disappointing.

* A strategic delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones is reviewing the roles and responsibilities of the middle tier in the education system. This work aims to ensure clarity and consistency in supporting the implementation of the new curriculum. The Minister states that successful implementation of the co-constructed curriculum is a key priority.

* The Minister explains that while changes to school performance measures can make it more challenging to look at long-term trends, those changes are made for good reasons to ensure they are in the best interests of learners. A broader range of data beyond exam results is being developed to give a more holistic picture of education performance. The Welsh Government has emphasized to consortia and others the importance of using performance data intelligently, not just relying on headline figures.

* The current interim school performance measures aim to encourage a focus on the progress of all learners, not just those at certain grade boundaries. These measures will eventually need to align with the new curriculum and any changes to qualifications. An independent review will provide feedback on the effectiveness of the interim measures.

* A new national evaluation and improvement resource is being developed to enable more robust self-evaluation in schools. It is being tested and evaluated, with plans to introduce it across the system in September 2020.

* The Minister said 11% of secondary schools being judged as unsatisfactory and needing urgent improvement is not acceptable. A new multi-agency approach is being piloted to provide extra support to schools causing significant concern and enable sustainable improvement.

* The Minister explained that changes have been made to school performance measures, even though it makes comparisons over time more difficult, because the changes are in the best interest of learners. The Welsh Government is looking at a broader range of data beyond exam results to evaluate school performance.

However, she is concerned about the situation with the ERW consortium and Neath Port Talbot's plans to withdraw.
