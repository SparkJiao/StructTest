1. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanical systems exhibit complex behaviors, making it challenging to predict their behavior accurately. Understanding the transport properties of such systems is crucial for various applications, including energy management and control.
2. Chaotic deterministic ratchets are a specific class of non-equilibrium systems characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Studying the transport properties of these systems is essential for developing efficient energy management strategies.
3. The transport properties of chaotic deterministic ratchets are sensitive to the parameters of the system, making it difficult to generalize results across different systems. This highlights the importance of considering ensemble behavior in studying these systems.
4. The current reversal phenomenon in chaotic deterministic ratchets is a key characteristic of these systems. Understanding the current reversal is crucial for predicting the behavior of the system and for designing efficient energy management strategies.
5. The current reversal in chaotic deterministic ratchets is a result of the system's sensitivity to initial conditions. This suggests that the current reversal is not a result of a bifurcation, but rather a general property of the system.
6. The current reversal in chaotic deterministic ratchets is a manifestation of the system's sensitivity to initial conditions. This highlights the importance of considering ensemble behavior in studying these systems.

The paper discusses the detection of normal galaxies in deep x-ray surveys, particularly focusing on the cdf-n survey. It highlights the importance of normal galaxies in the universe and their potential to dominate the number counts at 0.52 keV fluxes. The study extends to the entire plus  flanking fields region, focusing on galaxies at 0.52 keV to complement the study of spiral galaxies performed in paper 6. The paper also considers the evolution of x-ray luminosity per unit band luminosity with redshift, which is an indicator of current star formation rates. The authors use statistical methods to estimate the x-ray luminosity per unit band luminosity of normal "" spiral galaxies up to 0.52 keV fluxes. The study also includes the fraction of the diffuse x-ray background explained by galaxies lingering below the cdf-n detection threshold, and the contribution to the x-ray luminosity by normal galaxies. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the detection of normal galaxies in deep x-ray surveys and the potential impact on models of x-ray binary production in galaxies.",0,{'n_points': 4}

7,"1. Spin polarization and binary logic gates: The visionary who first thought of using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode a binary bit of information has never been identified conclusively.
2. Advantages of spin: First, there is the possibility of lower power dissipation in switching logic gates. In charge-based devices, such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors, switching between logic 0 and logic 1 is accomplished by moving charges into and out of the transistor channel.
3. Spin and noise: Second, spin does not couple easily to stray electric fields (unless there is strong spin-orbit interaction in the host material). Therefore, spin is likely to be relatively immune to noise.
4. Spin-based logic gates: Finally, it is possible that spin devices may be faster. If we do not have to move electrons around, we will not be limited by the transit time of charges.
5. Spin-based logic gates: If we do not have to move electrons around, we will not be limited by the transit time of charges.
6. Spin-based logic gates: Instead, we will be limited by the spin flip time, which could be smaller.
7. Spin-based logic gates: In 1994, we proposed a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (nand) using three spins placed in a weak magnetic field.
8. Spin-based logic gates: By ""three spins,"" we mean the spin orientations of three conduction band electrons, each confined in a semiconductor quantum dot.
9. Spin-based logic gates: The system is shown schematically in fig. 
10. Spin-based logic gates: exchange interaction is allowed only between nearest neighbor spins (second nearest neighbor interaction is considered too weak to have any effect).
11. Spin-based logic gates: because of the magnetic field, the spin orientation in any quantum dot becomes a binary variable; it is either parallel or anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field.
12. Spin-based logic gates: in the presence of exchange interaction between two electrons confined to two separate potentials (such as two different quantum dots), the anti-ferromagnetic ordering, or the singlet state, is preferred over the ferromagnetic ordering, or triplet state (two neighboring spins are anti-parallel).
13. Spin-based logic gates: we will assume that the tendency to preserve this anti-ferromagnetic ordering is stronger than the tendency for all spins to line up along the magnetic field.

9,"1. The powerful h@xmath5 emission detected by @xcite surprisingly represents only a small fraction of the group-wide warm h@xmath5 (with a lower limit luminosity of @xmath89 spread over @xmath90 kpc@xmath7) that dominates the mid-infrared emission of the system.
2. There is evidence for another shock-excited feature, the so-called h@xmath5 bridge between the main shock and ngc 7319, which is likely a remnant of past tidal interactions within the group.
3. The spatial variation in the distribution of the h@xmath5 0-0 line ratios implies differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked system, which will be explored fully in paper ii.

1. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity in the outer regions of the solar nebula, focusing on the effects of single-shot and continuous injection processes.
2. The authors examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity in the outer regions of the solar nebula, comparing the results of single-shot and continuous injection models.
3. The isotopic heterogeneity in the outer regions of the solar nebula is found to be highly heterogeneous, with the dispersion of the color field being significantly higher than in the inner regions.
4. The dispersion of the color field is found to be a strong function of orbital radius and time, with the dispersion initially being relatively large (180 yr) due to isotopes traveling downward and radially inward and outward.
5. The dispersion of the color field is found to decrease dramatically in the outer regions of the disk for both single-shot and continuous injection models by 777 yr to a value of 1% to 2%.
6. The dispersion of the color field is found to converge to similar radial distributions after 1370 yr, indicating that the dispersion of the color field is not particularly sensitive to the exact choice of the initial isotopic profile.
7. The dispersion of the color field is found to be significantly higher (10% to 20%) in the outer regions of the disk compared to the inner regions, due to the stronger mixing associated with the cooler outer disks.
8. The dispersion of the color field is found to be higher in the outer regions of the disk compared to the inner regions, suggesting that the dispersion of the color field is not controlled by the underlying mgu disk evolution.

21,"The standard model of elementary particles (SM) has been very successful in describing the nature at the electroweak (EW) scale. Recently, the Atlas and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have discovered a new particle that is consistent with the SM Higgs boson. This discovery strengthens the correctness of the SM. Several groups have reported an anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment (μg-2), which has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions (e.g., see references therein). The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than xmath10, as listed in table [tab: g-2]. Although it is too early to conclude that this anomaly is evidence of new physics beyond the SM, we expect new particles and interactions related with the muon sector once we regard it as a hint of new physics. Gauge interactions have been playing a central role in constructing fundamental models in particle physics history. Following this line, in this paper, we propose the possibility that the muon has a new gauge interaction beyond the SM. The measured muon g-2 (μg-2) and the estimated differences (Δμg-2) from the recent SM predictions in several references have been calculated. From the charge assignments, renormalizable terms in a Lagrangian that contribute to the lepton masses are given by xmath13. The Yukawa couplings of the charged leptons are not related to the neutrino mass. The neutrino mass is determined from the Yukawa couplings, majorana masses, and Yukawa couplings. Note that the mass terms between the left and right-handed neutrinos are diagonal. Therefore, the neutrino mixing is obtained by mixing among the right-handed neutrinos. If the majorana masses (μm) and μm are of the same order, the seesaw mechanism provides the observed order one neutrino mixing. From the seesaw formula, a relation between the parameters is given by xmath22. The interactions given by eq. (eq: mass terms) break the lepton symmetry. On the other hand, the anomaly against the gauge interaction is efficient at the early universe by the sphaleron process in the finite temperature. Therefore, the baryon asymmetry is washed out if both effects are important simultaneously. Let us calculate a condition such that the washout does not occur. First, the sphaleron process is efficient only at the temperature above the",0,{'n_points': 7}
22,"1. The study of entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is a unique property in the quantum world.
2. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems plays an important role in quantum information processing.
3. The study of entanglement essential features and dynamical behavior under the ubiquitous decoherence of relevant quantum systems has attracted much attention in recent years.
4. For example, it was found that the entanglement of qubits under the markovian decoherence can be terminated in a finite time despite the coherence of single qubit losing in an asymptotical manner.
5. The phenomenon called ""entanglement sudden death"" (ESD) has been observed experimentally.
6. This phenomenon is detrimental to the practical realization of quantum information processing using entanglement.
7. Some further studies indicated that ESD is not always the eventual fate of the qubit entanglement.
8. It was found that the entanglement can revive again after some time of ESD.
9. This revival entanglement plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.
10. Even in some occasions, ESD does not happen, instead finite residual entanglement can be preserved in the long time limit.
11. This can be due to the structured environment and physically results from the formation of a bound state between the qubit and its amplitude damping reservoir.
12. These results show rich dynamical behaviors of the entanglement and its characters.
13. The entanglement does not go away, it is still there but just changes the location.
14. This is reminiscent of the work of Yonac et al.
15. In the double-j-c model, the entanglement dynamics has been studied.
16. They found that the entanglement is transferred periodically among all the bipartite partitions of the whole system but an identity (see below) has been satisfied at any time.
17. This may be not surprising since the double-j-c model has no decoherence and any initial information can be preserved in the time evolution.
18. However, it would be surprising if the identity is still valid in the presence of the decoherence, in which a non-equilibrium relaxation process is involved.
19. In this paper, we show that it is indeed true for such a system consisting of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs.

23,"Summary 1: The origin of cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a mystery, with the most likely candidates being the collapse of a massive star and the coalescence of a compact binary system. The observed afterglow emission at lower wavelengths indicates that GRBs are at cosmological distances, with measured red shifts up to 4.5. The most likely candidates for GRBs are the collapse of a massive star and the coalescence of a compact binary system. The duration of a GW burst is predicted to be of the order of a few milliseconds for various sources, including the coalescing and merging black holes and neutron star binaries. The sensitivity of the present resonant detectors to detect GW bursts is limited by the unknown possible time difference between GRBs and GW bursts. The probability inversion method is used to infer the gw amplitude from the observed data, and the results are presented in a figure. The summary ends with the conclusion that the method can be applied to any expected delay between GRBs and GW bursts, with appropriate time shifting of the integration window.",0,{'n_points': 2}
24,"<summary>Scientific publications can be challenging to select, as they are often discovered through citation mechanisms. The citation distribution of scientific publications follows a power-law form with an exponent of 0.8, which is a consequence of highly cited papers being more likely to acquire further citations. The citation distribution of scientific publications is well studied and there exist a number of network models to mimic its complex structure and empirical results to confirm predictions. The proposed model for the citation network is a simple model that only considers two research areas and references within and across each other. The time evolution of the network can be described by a rate equation, and the total in-degree distribution can be found using the recurrence relation. The asymptotic behaviour of the total in-degree distribution is a power-law form with an exponent of 0.8, which only depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of the nodes. The distribution of average number of nodes with incoming cross-links can be found by summing over all possible values of the degree of the nodes in the network. The distribution of average number of nodes with incoming links can be found by summing over all its intra-links.

25,"1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) in either hadronic or nuclear collisions at high energies is traditionally framed in a two-step process that involves first a hard scattering of partons, followed by the fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.
2. The first part is calculable in perturbation QCD, while the second part makes use of fragmentation functions that are determined phenomenologically.
3. Such a production mechanism has recently been found to be inadequate for the production of particles at intermediate @xmath2 in heavy ion collisions, instead of fragmentation.
4. It is the recombination of partons that is shown to be the more appropriate hadronization process, especially when the soft partons are involved.
5. Although at extremely high @xmath2 fragmentation is still dominant, it is desirable to have a universal description that can be applied to any @xmath2, based on the same hadronization scheme.
6. To achieve that goal, it is necessary that the fragmentation process can be treated as the result of recombination of shower partons in a jet.
7. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and to determine their distributions in order to represent the phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
8. The subject matter of this work is primarily of interest only to high-energy nuclear collisions because hadronization in such processes is always in the environment of soft partons.",1,{'n_points': 8}

The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions is a topic of growing interest due to its applications in various complex systems. Recent progress has been made in understanding the stationary states of complex interacting particle systems using approximate analytical methods and simulations.

46,"Summary 1:
During the past few years, research in wireless ad-hoc networks and wireless sensor networks (WSNS) has escalated. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is targeted for wireless body area networks (WBANS), which requires low power and low data rate applications. The invasive computing concept is used to describe the future of computing and communications. Personal and business domains are densely populated with sensors. One area of increasing interest is the adaptation of technology to operate in and around human body. Many other potential applications like medical sensing control, wearable computing, and location identification are based on wireless body area networks (WBANS). Main aim of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is to provide a low-cost, low power, and reliable protocol for wireless monitoring of patient health. This standard defines physical layer and MAC sub layer. Three distinct frequency bands are supported in this standard. However, 2.4 GHz band is more important. This frequency range is same as IEEE 802.11b/g and Bluetooth. The paper focuses on analysis of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with non-beacon enabled mode configured in a star topology. We also consider that sensor nodes are using CSMA/CA protocol to access channel data. In literature, beacon enabled mode is used with slotted CSMA/CA for different network settings. In [1], performance analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 low power and low data rate wireless standard in WBANS is done. Authors consider a star topology at 2.4 GHz with up to 10 body implanted sensors. Long-term power consumption of devices is the main aim of their analysis. However, authors do not analyze their study for different data rates. An analytical model for non-beacon enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control (MAC) protocol is provided in [2]. Nodes use un-slotted CSMA/CA operation for channel access and packet transmission. Two main variables needed for channel access algorithm are back-off exponent (be) and number of back-offs (nb). Authors perform mathematical modeling for the evaluation statistical distribution of traffic generated by nodes. This mathematical model allows evaluating an optimum size packet so that success probability of transmission is maximize. However, authors do not analyze different MAC parameters with varying data rates. Authors carry out an extensive analysis based on simulations and real measurements to investigate the unreliability in the IEEE 802.15",0,{'n_points': 2}

In the cases where moped does accurately represent the likelihood function, its compression of the data and consequent much faster likelihood evaluation does provide orders of magnitude improvement in runtime.

69,"Summary 1: The transition from a liquid to an amorphous solid, often associated with a sharp increase in characteristic relaxation times, is a largely unresolved problem in statistical physics. The transition is triggered by an underlying thermodynamic equilibrium transition, which is believed to occur at a specific temperature (kauzmann temperature). The transition is characterized by the presence of one minimum-energy basin of attraction accessible to the system. The transition is not observed in experiments, but in simulations of polydisperse hard-core disks, which fail to detect any evidence of a thermodynamic transition up to extremely high packing fractions. The discrepancy between the simulated behavior of hard disks and soft spheres is attributed to inappropriate sampling at low temperatures and high densities. The value of the critical temperature predicted by the idealized mct is estimated to be around 1005 K, which is closer to the observed value of 1120 K. The transition is also observed in simulations of a ni@xmath1zr@xmath2 computer model, based on the electron theoretical description of transition metal alloys by hausleitner and hafner.",0,{'n_points': 2}

91,"<summary>During the last decades, a new type of artificial materials, the so-called left-handed metamaterials (lh), have attracted significant attention. These materials exhibit negative indices of refraction for certain wavelengths, with notable applications in modern optics and microelectronics. The localization length in disordered systems, where negative refraction in one-dimensional (1D) materials suppresses Anderson localization, is observed. Mogilevtsev et al. reported that the localization length in 1D disordered metamaterials is modulated by the reflection amplitude between alternating layers, leading to a linear dependence on disorder for low-disordered m stacks. The localization length in homogeneous stacks is found to be quadratic for long wavelengths, while in asymmetric stacks, it saturates for low-disordered m stacks. The localization length in mixed stacks of alternating lh and rh layers is also studied, showing a linear dependence on disorder for low-disordered m stacks and a quadratic dependence for long wavelengths.</summary>",0,{'n_points': 8}

In the absence of interactions, if impurity distributions are completely random, all states of the spectrum are exponentially localized in dimensions one (1d) and two (2d).

3. The 2d - drdm model is studied in the context of a weakly interacting boson system, where the presence of correlated impurities leads to a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength.

127,"<summary>Understanding Phase Transitions: From Macroscopic to Microscopic</summary>

Phase transitions are pivotal in understanding the behavior of physical systems, particularly in condensed matter physics, where they play a crucial role in the phase diagram of materials. The most dramatic changes in macroscopic properties occur at phase transitions, often involving symmetry breaking. The theory of such phase transitions was formulated by Landau as a phenomenological model, later developed from microscopic principles using the renormalization group. One can identify phases by knowledge of an order parameter, which is zero in the disordered phase and nonzero in the ordered phase. In many known models, the order parameter can only be defined in a complicated non-local way. These systems include topological states like topological insulators, quantum spin Hall states, and quantum spin liquids. Therefore, we need to develop new methods to identify parameters capable of describing phase transitions. Such methods might be borrowed from machine learning. Since the 1990s, this field has undergone major changes with the development of powerful computers and artificial neural networks. It has been shown that such neural networks can approximate every function under mild assumptions. They quickly found applications in image classification, speech recognition, natural language understanding, and predicting from high-dimensional data. Furthermore, they began to outperform other algorithms on these tasks. In the last years, physicists started to employ machine learning techniques. Most of the tasks were tackled by supervised learning algorithms or with the help of reinforcement learning. supervised learning means one is given labeled training data from which the algorithm learns to assign labels to data points. After successful training, it can then predict the labels of previously unseen data with high accuracy. In addition to supervised learning, there are unsupervised learning algorithms which can find structure in unlabeled data. They can also classify data into clusters, which are however unlabelled. It is already possible to employ unsupervised learning techniques to reproduce Monte Carlo-sampled states of the Ising model. Phase transitions were found in unsupervised manner using principal component analysis. We transition from principal component analysis to variational autoencoders, and finally test how the latter handles different physical models. Our algorithms are able to find a low-dimensional latent representation of the physical system which coincides with the correct order parameter. The decoder network reconstructs the encoded configuration from its latent representation. We find that the reconstruction is more accurate in the ordered phase, which suggests the use of the reconstruction error as a universal identifier for phase transitions. In contrast, physicists use unsupervised learning to determine phase",0,{'n_points': 8}

The success of the cold dark matter cosmological model, which includes baryons in the form of elementary particles, argues strongly for a significant component of the dark matter being in the form of an elementary particle.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a triangular quantum dot (TQD) can serve as a qubit. The TQD is a system of three coherently coupled quantum dots with a single electron spin on each dot. The qubit exchange interactions between the spins are described by an effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian, where the Zeeman term accounts for an external magnetic field. The qubit states are encoded in the doublet subspace and can be controlled by exchange interactions. The qubit dynamics is described by a time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a Hamiltonian that includes the exchange interactions. We show that the qubit can be read out using a measurement of currents flowing through the system. The qubit can be prepared in the state of the doublet subspace for moderate magnetic fields, and the qubit dynamics can be controlled by the qubit states.

The topological phases are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interactions, such as bismuth or iridium. The honeycomb lattice is a promising system for topological insulators due to its non-trivial topological invariants. The extended hubbard model is used to study the stability of the tmi phase. The mean-field analysis and variational Monte Carlo methods are employed to examine the stability of the tmi phase. The stability of the tmi phase is studied by tuning the fermi velocity at the dirac cone and the on-site coulomb repulsion. The results show that the tmi phase is stabilized by reducing the fermi velocity and tuning the on-site coulomb repulsion. The stability of the tmi phase is robust in the region where the cdw phase dominates.

161,"1. The paper discusses the detection of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (llagns) in the millimeter and submillimeter bands, highlighting their presence in about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and occupying a majority of the population of active galactic nuclei.
2. The authors propose that the low-luminosity nature of llagns is caused by very low accretion rates on to supermassive black holes, which is explained by the adaf model, a model of optically thin disc accretion flows.
3. The adaf model predicts a submillimetre bump in the spectral energy distribution (sed) of llagns, while the standard disc is responsible for a big blue bump in the sed of luminous agns such as quasars. Since the adaf model successfully explains the broadband spectra of llagns, the first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very-long baseline interferometry (vlbi) instruments.
4. The authors note that the submillimetre bump means a highly inverted spectrum at centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelengths of spectral index 1.5, where flux density at frequency 6.5 is 510 times larger than that at centimetre wavelengths in sgr A* (e.g., @xcite).

170,"<summary>Modern Accelerator-Based Neutrino Oscillation Experiments Require Good Control over Intermediate-Energy Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering Cross Sections</summary>

The analysis of modern accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments requires good control over the intermediate-energy neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section. In particular, the importance of multi-nucleon events has been suggested in many calculations of charge-changing quasielastic cross sections. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations is now thought to be essential for a proper description of data on neutrino experiments with accelerators. Thus, a growing interest has arisen in including 2p-2h models into the Monte Carlo event generators used by the neutrino collaborations. The only 2p-2h model implemented up to date in some of the Monte Carlo neutrino event generators corresponds to the ific valence model, which has been incorporated in genie. There are also plans to incorporate the lyon model in genie, while phenomenological approaches like the effective transverse enhancement model of xw are implemented, for instance, in nuwro generator. One of the main problems to implementing the 2p-2h models is the high computational time. This is due to the large number of nested integrals involved in the evaluation of the inclusive hadronic tensor with sums over the final 2p-2h states. To speed up the calculations, several approximations can be made, such as choosing an average momentum for the nucleons in the local fermi gas, neglecting the exchange matrix elements, or reducing the number of integrations to two nested integrals by performing a non-relativistic expansion of the current operators. The latter approach is only useful for some pieces of the elementary 2p-2h response. In this work, we present a fast and very efficient method to calculate the inclusive hadronic tensor for two-nucleon emission in the relativistic fermi gas, given by the following expression: <br><br> <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody><tr><td width=""100%""><img src=""https://dashscope-result.s3.amazonaws.com/160408423/160408423_1.png"" alt=""table_denom""></td></tr></tbody></table> </summary>",0,{'n_points': 8}

184,"1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the early 1980s.
2. Stochastic resonance is the effect of nonmonotone dependence of the response of a system on the noise when this noise is added to a periodic input signal.
3. An extensive review on stochastic resonance and its presence in different fields of applications can be found in @xcite.
4. Following @xcite, as stochastic resonance we intend the phenomenon in which the transmission of a signal can be improved (in terms of statistical quantities) by the addition of noise.
5. The problem is to estimate a signal @xmath4 transmitted through a channel.
6. This signal has to be detected by a receiver that can reveal signals louder than a threshold @xmath1.
7. If @xmath2 is bounded from above by @xmath1, the signal is not observable and the problem has not a solution.
8. But, if some noise @xmath3 is added to the signal, the perturbed signal @xmath4 may be observable and inference can be done on @xmath2.
9. Too few noise is not sufficient to give good estimates and too much noise deteriorates excessively the signal.
10. The optimal in some sense level of the noise will be called stochastic resonance in this framework.
11. Usually, the criterion applied to measure optimality of estimators are the shannon mutual information or the kullback divergence.
12. More recently, the fisher information quantity have been also proposed (see @xcite and @xcite).
13. Here we are concerned with the fisher information quantity.
14. It happens that this quantity, as a function of the noise, can be maximized for certain noise structures.
15. If there is only one global maximum, the corresponding noise level is the value for which we have stochastic resonance, if several local maxima are present, the phenomenon is called stochastic multi-resonance.",0,{'n_points': 7}

3. The authors also measure the angular patterns of the longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures for the twinned and untwinned crystals, showing that the angular patterns are not free of phononic contributions.

192,"1. Rapidity gaps, which are pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity, have been observed in hadronic collisions at the HERA and Tevatron colliders.
2. Such rapidity gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons, the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state, and the survival probability of rapidity gaps of order 10%.
3. The survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without soft interactions between other partons in the scattering hadrons.

199,"Summary:
The nucleon in the low-energy regime is described by a unified chiral interaction that includes both the short-range interaction (giving rise to the spin-singlet states) and the long-range Yukawa interaction (giving rise to the spin-singlet states). The short-range interaction is crucial for the nucleon's stability and is related to the fermi nature of constituent quarks and the specific interactions between them. The chiral interaction is responsible for the short-range repulsion in the nucleon, which is also responsible for the hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the long-range attraction in the nucleon, which is implied by the Yukawa part of the pion-exchange and correlated two-pion exchanges. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the tensor and spin-orbit forces, which come from the pseudoscalar- and vector-exchange Yukawa tails. The chiral interaction is also responsible for the necessary effective repulsion in the dominant configuration of the chiral interaction, which is related to the energy ballance.

2. The present disclosure relates to a person support apparatus, such as a bed and with a mechanism suitable for adjusting the height and orientation of a patient support frame forming part of that bed.
3. The patient support frame is supported on a deck support or intermediate frame and the deck support frame is provided with a mechanism for adjusting the height of the deck and hence the height of the support surface above the floor on which the apparatus is located, and to control the orientation or inclination of the deck and hence the patient support surface relative to the floor.
4. The mechanism includes a guide element arranged on its side (i.e., with its open side extending in a vertical direction) and arranged around the outside of longitudinal elements having a rectangular cross-section. This arrangement results in a deck support frame which is robust and stable and can accommodate the changes in geometry necessary for movement or adjustment between the horizontal, Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg positions.
5. Some embodiments of the channel and roller mechanism change the height of a patient support deck by pivoting one or more leg assemblies relative to the under surface of the patient support frame.
6. Features of some illustrative embodiments include the following: 
   - Lower part count than known systems and are therefore likely to be both cheaper and more robust.
   - Opening of the channel carrying the guide elements or rollers faces the floor. This means that dirt is less likely to enter it and interfere with the mechanism.
   - Any dirt that enters will not be visible in normal use.
   - The leg assembly works vertically within the channel edges and a reduced force is therefore necessary to lift the patient support frame especially from the low position where the leg assemblies suspend a narrow angle relative to the underside of the patient support frame.

231,"<summary>1. The invention is based on a generic hydraulic unit for a vehicle brake system. The hydraulic unit has at least one pump that has a piston, and the piston is indirectly drivable by an electric motor via an eccentric that is rotatable inside an eccentric chamber. Because it cannot be precluded that the moving piston may entrain pressure fluid into the eccentric chamber through a sealing ring or the like on the occasion of pump operation, a conduit extends downward from the eccentric chamber and opens to the atmosphere through a housing block that receives the at least one pump; a check valve that can open toward the atmosphere is built into the conduit. Pressure fluid that has been entrained into the eccentric chamber and drips from the piston enters the conduit and stresses the check valve, causing it to open, and finally flows out of the housing block. As a result, filling of the eccentric chamber with pressure fluid is averted, so that pressure fluid remains far away from the electric motor, or in other words does not penetrate the electric motor and impair the operability thereof. 2. In a hydraulic unit known from International Patent Disclosure WO 96/13416, the electric motor is located above an eccentric chamber, in which the eccentric acting on at least one piston of a pump is rotatable. Once again, a conduit leads downward from the eccentric chamber, directly or indirectly to a so-called central venting point, where an element is installed that is permeable to air but not to water from the environment, so as to equalize the pressure of the eccentric chamber, for instance, relative to the ambient atmosphere and on the other hand to prevent at least splashing water from entering the unit. As an additional provision, the central venting point may have a check valve mentioned in this aforementioned patent disclosure. For instance, a check valve disclosed in the first reference cited, EP 0 629 836 B1, could be used.

234,"<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>

1. The invention involves a valve for controlling bulk dispensing of viscous substances, particularly where it is desirable to have a valve that can be operated with one hand while the other hand holds a receiving vessel, such as in fast-food restaurants, etc.
2. The valve comprises a tubular sleeve adapted to be inserted into the spout of a bag or pouch, having a dispensing package extending therethrough. At the outlet end of this passage is a guide extending at a right angle to the axis thereof and this slide carries a receprocable gate. Cooperating lugs are provided on the gate and guide so that by engagement thereof with the fingers of one hand, the gate can be reciprocated to position it over the discharge or dispensing outlet.
3. The valve includes a gate valve guide member integral with the sleeve and extending radially outward from the sleeve. The guide member is in the form of a transversely-curved plate with curved edges that provide inwardly-opening grooves for receiving the opposite side edges of the sleeve. The guide member is curved transversely relative to the axis of the sleeve in a manner and for a purpose to be described.
4. The gate valve member comprises a plate curved transversely complementally to the curvature of the guide plate. This plate has flanges of channel-formations that produce opposed guide-receiving formations for receiving the opposite side edges of the guide plate. The guide channels are precisely fitted onto the edges of the plate so as to draw the transversely curved gate plate tightly into engagement with the complementally transversely curved guide plate.
5. The gate valve member is reciprocated on the guide member by means of an integral upward guide and operating channel-like extension extending upwardly from the gate plate. This extension is disposed at the center-line of the gate plate and guide plate, radially of the discharge outlet of the sleeve. It is formed so as to have a flat-finger lug at its upper or outer end and a similar but split lug at its inner or lower end. The extension has opposed side guide flanges that slideably fit in an undercut guide slot in the wall of the sleeve for vertical or radial reciprocation.
6. The valve assembly is mounted on the spout of a bag by guiding the tapered sleeve into the spout until the outer edge of the spout is engaged by the guide plate. The interior surfaces of the spout will frictionally seal with the adjacent exterior surface",0,{'n_points': 10}

238,"<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary> The inventor has designed a novel sanitizable rotary valve that combines elements previously found in the valve art but adds a unique feature of partial (sealed) separation of the rotor-stator faces to allow flushing across the process fluid-contacting surfaces. This partial separation would normally result in sanitizing fluid leaking out of the valve, leading to non-aseptic operation, but a novel diaphragm-like elastomeric seal has been invented which functions to both seal the two faces together in normal use and retain sanitizing process fluids when the faces are partially separated for cleaning. This design allows the unique sanitary operation of the valve that is disclosed herein, enabling the ability to sanitize in place (SIP) without disassembling the valve. Additionally, the invention provides a sliding multi-port diaphragm valve with at least two inner surfaces, including a rotor with a stator-facing surface and a diaphragm with a dynamic wipe sealing lip, which allows periodic sanitization and cleaning of the port sealing faces of the stator and rotor without loss of fluid to the outside. The invention also provides an insert molding process for forming in place a rotary valve diaphragm seal, including the steps of affixing a mold base to the rotor, capping ports with flange-forming plugs, and injecting the rotor with an elastomer suitable for forming a diaphragm seal. The invention also provides a multi-port sliding valve with a linear slider, a stator with a plurality of connection ports and associated channels in liquid communication with external fluid sources and separation means, and orthogonal separation means for partially separating the slider body from the stator body to allow flushing of sanitizing fluid across the stator face without loss of fluid to the outside. The invention also provides a simple and reliable elastomeric means of ensuring sealing of all ports in a slider valve which is tolerant of imperfect flatness or parallelism of the stator or slider sealing faces, which maintains an acceptable sealing integrity over a useful life at least equal to that of typical chromatographic beds used for pharmaceutical manufacturing purification processes.",0,{'n_points': 3}
239,"<summary>Enhanced Gas-Liquid Contacting Tray Assembly and Method</summary>  
The present invention provides an improved tray valve assembly for a gas-liquid contacting tray, including a circular disc with a first and second leg disposed in a downwardly inclined orientation. The valve assembly includes a valve cover mounted on the disc, with the valve cover having a first leg disposed to intercept the liquid flow across the tray and a second leg disposed along a line perpendicular to the downcomer. The valve assembly further includes means for selectively biasing the rear region of the valve cover upwardly against the liquid flow for facilitating initial, directionalized vapor flow therethrough. The valve assembly also includes a circular disc mounted above the active tray area, with the disc having first and second legs in support thereof, the first leg wider than the second leg for directing flow therearound. The valve aperture is circular in shape and the valve legs are disposed in slotted regions disposed outwardly of the circular aperture to prevent the rotation of the valve plate for maintaining the orientation of the valve leg relative to the tray. The biasing means comprises a detent portion formed on the cover of the valve for preventing the surface thereof from resting flush against the tray surface. This design facilitates the initial passage of vapor through the valve. The valves are also comprised of circular discs mounted in and above circular apertures formed in the active tray area. Certain ones of the valves are oriented for the directional thrust of vapor therethrough in a select orientation that is not parallel to the initial flow of liquid thereacross for imparting a directional thrust to the liquid flow. In this manner, the direction of liquid flow can be effected, which further enhances the effectiveness of a raised active inlet area adapted for the discharge of vapor into the liquid coming from a downcomer for passage onto the valve area.",0,{'n_points': 3}

Pyrazolotriazoles, such as those described herein, are useful magenta couplers for photographic products. However, they are difficult to synthesize. Only a few synthetic routes are known. One of the preferred synthetic routes involves preparation of the triazolothiadiazines 1 and subsequent desulfurization reaction to give the pyrazolotriazoles 2. The triazolothiadiazines 1 can be prepared in two ways; the first, by reaction of 4-amino-5-mercapto-3-substituted(R)-1,2,4-triazoles (4) with alpha-haloketones, or the second, by reaction of 2-hydrazino-5-substituted-(R&#39;)-1,3,4-thiadiazines (5) with acyl halides and subsequent dehydrative ring closure. Both the triazoles 4 and the thiadiazines 5 are readily available from thiocarbohydrazide; ##STR4## The desulfurization of these triazolothiadiazines 1 to the pyrazolotriazoles 2: ##STR5## is effected in two steps; the first, a ring contraction reaction of 1 by heating in acetic anhydride to give 1-acetyl-7-acetylthio-3,6-disubstituted-1H-pyrazolo[5,1-c]-1,2,4-triazoles (6) and, the second, hydrolysis of acetyl groups and desulfurization at the same time with hydrochloric acid to give the desired 2. ##STR6## Although this is the most attractive and practical method for desulfurization among those available, there are several drawbacks in using this as a manufacturing process.

The invention provides a lockstitch sewing machine with a rotary hook arrangement that prevents the bobbin housing from rotating with the hook body. The rotary hook includes a bobbin housing, a bobbin capsule carrier, and a spring-loaded holding finger. The spring-loaded holding finger is arranged on the bobbin capsule carrier and engages with a cutout in the bobbin capsule. The cutout is located at a distance before the holding finger in the direction of hook rotation. The spring-loaded holding finger is approximately centered between the two cams when the sewing machine is running, so that a thread passage gap is formed on both sides of the holding finger. During the looping around the bobbin housing, the spring-loaded holding finger is bent back briefly by the needle thread loop, which causes it to move through the rear and front thread passage gaps without using a capsule release device and without having to rotate the bobbin housing. During the pulling back of the needle thread loop, the spring-loaded holding finger is simply bent back by the needle thread. The spring-loaded holding finger offers not appreciable resistance if the spring force is rated correctly. The rotary hook is particularly useful for lockstitch sewing machines with a bobbin housing that is rotatable.",0,{'n_points': 4}

The invention relates to a jointing structure in vehicle traveling path joints and the like having an expansion function and also to a method of mounting an elastic member therein, and is useful in applications mainly to vehicle traveling path joints in new transit systems, monorails and the like and besides, to road bed plate joints in road bridges, footbridges and the like.  
2. The invention comprises more than one step provided face to face at the coaxial built traveling path ends with an expansion gap between, more than one elastic member respectively mounted inside the above more than one step, and a joint block mounted on the above more than one elastic member across the above expansion gap.  
3. The present invention is adapted to prevent, by blocking up the expansion gap in a bridge girder joint with the joint block while permitting an expansion gap function to be maintained, the occurrence of tire fall-in and/or stuck-in situations for the achievement of smooth and safe vehicle traveling (see  FIG. 2 ).  
4. It will be appreciated that even in the occurrence of any displacement such as the vertical differences in level and/or the lateral displacements and besides, the kinked joints in the joints of the bridge girders especially due to the earthquake or the like, the joint block may be conditioned to be always in the center of the expansion gap thanks to elastic member deformation for the elimination and/or relief of the differences in level and/or the lateral displacements and the like, resulting in the achievement of smooth vehicle traveling without the need for any emergency measures involving the use of the steel sheets or the like.  
5. It will be appreciated also that the joint block is placed across the expansion gap, and thus, the adequate management of accuracy of each member if given may be adapted to prevent the differences in level from occurring in any joint portion between the joint block and the traveling path.  
6. It is noted that the use of a joint block made of the same concrete as that of the traveling path may be adapted to provide more substantially increased slip resistance to the tires, as compared with the rubber or steel expansion joint. It is noted also especially that a high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete joint block is as highly durable as hardly worn away, and is thus considered to be suitably applicable to the joint block for use in the present invention.

The invention relates generally to downhole tools for conducting mechanical activities in wells, and more specifically, to a simply and efficiently operable mechanism for installing and removing objects in wells, including objects that might be stuck or lost within a well bore.

<summary>Background of the Invention</summary>
The subject matter hereof is related to the subject matter of U.S. Pat. No. 4,061,389 and is directed specifically to the improvement that promotes effective connection of a pull tool to a down hole object or fish and simple and effective disconnection of the pull tool from the article if such is desired. 

<summary>Background of the Invention</summary>
During drilling operations, well servicing operations, and the like, objects may become lost or stuck within a well bore and these objects are typically referred to in the industry as ""fish."" For example, a section of drill pipe or production tubing might become disconnected from a pipe string and it is then necessary to introduce a pull tool into the well bore, establish connection with the fish and then remove the fish. Many different types of pull tools, grap pling devices, spears, etc. have been developed for the purpose of conducting fishing operations in well bores. It is typical for wire line operations to be utilized for the purpose of introducing a pull tool into the well bore for fishing operations. 

<summary>Background of the Invention</summary>
In many cases, down hole devices are positioned within casing and tubing strings for the purpose of controlling well operations. In most cases, such down hole devices are equipped with API Standard fishing necks which normally include an undercut shoulder to enable grappling by standard installation and retrieval tools. Quite often the API Standard fishing neck will become corroded or eroded by well conditions to the point that only a stub pipe is exposed without the usual undercut shoulder that is provided on the fishing neck. Connection between a wire line controlled fishing tool and a worn fishing neck may be accomplished by means of an overshot type grappling device generally defined by a collet structure having internal teeth that establish a gripping relation with the worn fishing neck. Although overshot type retrieving tools are successfully utilized in many cases, a common problem with such tools is the inability of the operator to achieve disconnection from the worn fishing neck in the event the tool is unable to accomplish an effective pulling operation. Occasionally, disconnection can be achieved by a substantial jarring or other violent mechanical movement, but, in some cases",0,{'n_points': 9}

These sensors generate electrical signals proportional to the distance between moving objects and a fixed reference point. The sensor monitoring system provides a method to multiplex multiple sensors on a minimum number of wires, reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency. The sensor window reference circuit continuously compares the sensor output to the existing output, adjusting the output if it is above a preset high reference signal or below a preset low reference signal. The sensor generates a relatively small reference signal that is large enough to eliminate small values of drift in a negative going direction yet not generate a significant amount of signal due to the discrete nature of the calibration voltages from a DAC and counter combination. The sensor also includes a digitally stored offset and error correction closed-loop compensation circuit that constantly compares the sensor output to a desired minimum value and generates a correction signal to deliver a sensor signal output that is as close to the desired minimum as practical without requiring unnecessary circuitry.",0,{'n_points': 3}

The system comprises a control unit that receives signals indicating accelerator pedal position and throttle valve position, processes these signals to provide a control signal to a DC motor, which automatically sets the throttle position for optimum performance. The control unit also provides an output signal which controls a clutch. The clutch connects the accelerator pedal directly to the throttle valve when manual control is desired. During manual control, the vehicle driver has full control of the vehicle. Changing control from automatic to manual, however, does not occur until the throttle valve is moved either to a predetermined position or is positioned to match what is commanded by the accelerator pedal. Thus, the vehicle is prevented from lurching forward or stalling when control is shifted from automatic to manual.

1. The invention proposes a method for compressing natural gas in a compressor station for a gas pipeline, particularly in permanent frost areas. The method includes compressing the gas at least during individual intervals to a substantially higher pressure than the desired exit pressure, cooling the compressed gas by the heat exchange to a temperature above the exit temperature, and obtaining the further cooling to the desired exit temperature by expanding the gas from the excess pressure to the desired exit pressure. 

2. The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series. Between the compressor stages and particularly after the last compressor stage, cooling by heat exchange takes place (usually air/gas heat exchange), in order to reach the required lower exit temperature of at most 0° C., preferably -5° C., for the re-entry of the compressed gas into the gas pipeline. 

3. During the warmer period of the year, in which the use of re-cooling units was necessary for ensuring the required exit temperature, the invention provides for a different type of cooling. The invention utilizes the known physical effect according to which a compressed gas is inevitably cooled when expanded to a lower pressure, either by throttling or with the simultaneous performance of work. In order to ensure the required exit pressure or nominal pressure at the exit of the compressor station, the invention provides that the gas to be transported is compressed to an excess pressure which is substantially above the exit pressure, for example, 10 to 50 bar above the exit pressure, to carry out at the end of the single-stage or multiple-stage compression a cooling by heat exchange, particularly by air/gas heat exchange, and subsequently to expand the compressed gas to the desired exit pressure.

The invention starts from the fact that it is known to carry out the compression of a gas supplied at an entry pressure below the nominal pressure (rated pressure of the gas pipeline) to an increased pressure, wherein the compression can be carried out in a single stage or in multiple stages in compressors which are connected in series.

The fan housing includes an air inlet and an air outlet, and the air streams produced by the impeller can be effectively concentrated to the center and then blow to the center portion of the heat sink having the highest temperature when the heat sink is assembled with the heat-dissipating device. The air passage formed by the sidewall of the passage of the housing reduces gradually and evenly in its cross-sectional area, thus enhancing the air streams produced by the rotation of blades of the impeller and effectively concentrating the air streams to the center. The air inlet side of the housing extends radially outwardly so as to enlarge the intake area of the air streams, and the air outlet side extends radially outwardly so as to enlarge the discharge area of the air streams. The design of the sidewall of the passage at the air inlet side of the housing is preferably formed with an inclined portion or a beveled edge, and the inclined portion can greatly enlarge the intake airflow area and reduce noises of the turbulent flow produced owing to uneven intake airflow area of the conventional fan. The design of the sidewall of the passage at the air outlet side of the housing is preferably formed with an inwardly inclined portion from the air inlet side to the air outlet side of the housing, and the air streams can be concentrated toward the center to provide better heat-dissipating performance for the heat-dissipating device that requires concentrated air streams. The design of the sidewall of the passage at the air inlet side of the housing is preferably formed with an inwardly inclined portion from the air inlet side to the air outlet side of the housing, and the air streams can be concentrated toward the center to provide better heat-dissipating performance for the heat-dissipating device that requires concentrated air streams. The design of the sidewall of the passage at the air outlet side of the housing is preferably formed with an inwardly inclined portion from the air inlet side to the air outlet side of the housing, and the air streams can be concentrated toward the center to provide better heat-dissipating performance for the heat-dissipating device that requires concentrated air streams.

369,"<summary>Summary of the Invention</summary>

1. Pb/Bi-containing high-dielectric materials are convenient but Pb and Bi are very reactive and diffuse into and through metals such as Pd or Pt, making it difficult to integrate them directly on Si.
2. A Ge buffer layer on Si oxidizes less readily and can be used to prevent or minimize the formation of a low dielectric constant layer.
3. An epitaxial Ge layer on Si provides a good buffer layer which is compatible with Si and also many oxides.
4. Unlike other buffer layers, Ge is a semiconductor (it can also be doped to provide a reasonably highly conductive layer) and is compatible with Si process technology.
5. The epitaxial growth of Ge on top of ferroelectric or high-dielectric constant oxide is much easier than Si which makes it possible to form three-dimensional epitaxial structures.
6. However, not all oxides are stable next to Ge. For example, all ferroelectrics containing Pb such as Pb(Ti,Zr)O (PZT) are not thermodynamically stable next to Ge (since PbO is not stable).",0,{'n_points': 6}

394,"<summary>Summary of the Application</summary>

The application is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/737,546, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,332, which was filed on Dec. 12, 1996, and designated the U.S. The application focuses on a simplified connection system for high voltage cables, including an apparatus and/or a second high voltage cable consisting of a cable termination and a rigid insulator. The interface between the cable end and any accessory, between two cable ends or between two apparatus is generally applicable, resulting in a number of advantages, such as factory pretesting, reduction of installation time and cost, and simplified field testing. The stress cone design and dimensions would also be the same for all applications, the only variation being the diameter of the cable or apparatus entrance. The interface components do not include any gas or oil and, therefore, they cannot leak or explode. The outer cone concept over the inner cone concept has the advantage of a shorter solution outside an SF6 cubicle, and the substantially plane surface interconnection has the advantage of simplifying complete alignment of meeting surfaces without risking glow discharges. The compact design, lower material and installation cost, complete independence between gas insulated switchgear and cable installations, standardization, and the outer surface configuration of the rigid insulator with a conical interface surface are the key advantages of the invention.",0,{'n_points': 3}

413,"Summary 1: The Food Stamp Program provides eligible low-income households with paper coupons or electronic benefits that can be redeemed for food in stores nationwide. FNS funds food stamp benefits and about half of the states' administrative costs and establishes regulations for implementing the Food Stamp Program. FNS regulations require that states certify household eligibility at least annually and establish requirements for households to report changes that occur after they are certified. Recently, FNS introduced several options and waivers to food stamp rules and regulations in order to increase program access and reduce the reporting burden on working families while minimizing the potential for payment errors. These include options and waivers related to program eligibility, reporting requirements, extending food stamp benefits to households leaving TANF, and options related to TANF recipients. To monitor program accountability, FNS’s quality control system measures states’ performance in accurately determining food stamp eligibility and calculating benefits. States implement the Food Stamp Program by determining whether households meet established limits on gross income and assets, calculating monthly benefits for eligible households, and issuing benefits to households. The actual amount of the food stamp benefit is based on household income after certain deductions—including shelter, dependent care, and child support. To be eligible for benefits, a household’s gross income may not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level and the value of its assets may not exceed $2,000. If the household owns a vehicle worth more than $4,650, the excess value is included in calculating the household’s assets.",0,{'n_points': 2}

2. Medicare payments for ambulance services are made up of two components: a service-level payment for the type of transport provided and a mileage payment. Providers may be affiliated with an institution (such as a hospital or a fire department) and share resources and operational costs, or they may be independent and freestanding.
3. Providers may rely heavily on volunteers, use both volunteers and paid staff, or use only paid staff. Providers may specialize in nonemergency transports, or offer both nonemergency and emergency (those responding to a 911 call) transports.
4. Some providers offer only basic life support (BLS) services, while others offer advanced life support (ALS) services. ALS services require the skills of a medical technician who is more specialized and trained, such as a paramedic, than the technician who can provide BLS services.
5. Revenue sources depend on the resources available in communities and communities' choices about funding ambulance services. They may include community tax support, charitable donations, in-kind contributions, state and federal grants, subscription programs, and payments from Medicare or Medicaid and private health insurance companies (including patient copayments or coinsurance).
6. Communities differ by the level of tax support for specific services, such as ensuring a minimum level of service in remote areas, sophistication of transport vehicles, and the training level of the staff. Medicare pays ambulance providers through a national fee schedule.
7. Improvements, and Modernization Act of 2003, temporarily extended by subsequent acts, and most recently extended through the end of 2012 by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.

2. The first wave of the baby boom generation will start turning age 65 in 2011 and the last of the boomers will be 65 in 2029.
3. This development will lead to significant changes in the ratio of the working age population to the population age 65 or older. The aged dependency ratio will rise from 21% in 2000 to 35% by 2030.
4. The increase in the aged dependency ratio is not only occurring because of the growing numbers of older persons but also due to the slowing growth of the labor force of younger workers over the last decade.
5. Several recent changes in Social Security retirement policy could strengthen incentives to work longer. Social Security provides monthly benefits to qualified retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured workers. These benefits are the primary source of income (more than 50%) for nearly 57% of the population age 65 and older.
6. In April 2000, the practice of reducing Social Security benefits when a beneficiary has earnings and has reached the normal retirement age (currently 65 years and 4 months) was eliminated, at least in part to remove the disincentive to work.
7. The delayed retirement credit for persons who first claim benefits after the normal retirement age is steadily being increased until it reaches 8% per year in 2008.
8. Prior to these increases, those who chose to work beyond normal retirement age might receive less Social Security over their lifetime because the start of their benefit receipt was delayed. Some members of Congress have also put forward proposals that would raise normal retirement age for benefits beyond the current schedule of increases, as well as proposals that increase the early retirement age of 62.

519,"1. DOD relies on its research laboratories and test facilities to develop new technologies and systems that improve and enhance military operations and ensure technological superiority over adversaries.
2. Historically, DOD has experienced problems in bringing technologies out of the lab environment and into real use. At times, technologies do not leave the lab because their potential has not been adequately demonstrated or recognized. In other cases, acquisition programs that receive the bulk of DOD's funding in research, development, testing, and evaluation of technology are unwilling to fund final stages of development of promising technologies, preferring to invest in other aspects of the program that are viewed as more vital to success.
3. DOD and Congress have established a number of ""technology transition"" programs, each with a particular focus. (See table 1.) The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, for example, was initiated by DOD in 1994 as a way to get technologies that meet critical military needs into the hands of users faster and at less cost than the traditional acquisition process. Under this program, military operators test prototypes that have already been developed and matured in realistic settings. If they find the items to have military utility, DOD may choose to buy additional quantities or just use the remaining items after the demonstration. In 1980, DOD established the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program to identify, evaluate, and procure technologies that have already been developed and tested in other countries—saving DOD the costly burden of maturing the technology itself. Other programs include those that seek to quickly identify and solve production problems associated with technology transition (the Manufacturing Technology Program—MANTECH) and to partner with the commercial sector in completing projects that are useful to both military and industry (the Dual Use Science and Technology program). Even taken together, however, these programs represent a very small portion of DOD dollars spent on applied research and advanced technology development—about $9 billion annually—and considerably less of total money spent on the later stages of technology development, which includes an additional $60 billion spent on advanced component development and prototypes, largely within weapons acquisition programs. As such, they cannot single-handedly overcome transition problems, but rather demonstrate various ways to ease transition and broaden participation from the industrial base.

564,"1. The September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have drawn attention to the security of many institutions, facilities, and systems in the United States, including the nation's water supply and water quality infrastructure.
2. Water infrastructure systems are highly interconnected with other infrastructure systems, especially electric power and transportation, as well as the chemical industry which supplies treatment chemicals, making security of all of them an issue of concern.
3. These types of vulnerable interconnections were evident during the August 2003 electricity blackout in the Northeast United States: wastewater treatment plants in Cleveland, Detroit, New York, and other locations that lacked backup generation systems lost power and discharged millions of gallons of untreated sewage during the emergency.
4. Natural disasters such as the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and 2007 Mississippi River floods caused extensive and costly damage to multiple infrastructure systems—transportation, water, electric power, and telecommunications.
5. Broadly speaking, water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources of untreated water for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and household needs; dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipes that contain and transport raw water; treatment facilities that remove contaminants from raw water; finished water reservoirs; systems that distribute water to users; and wastewater collection and treatment facilities.
6. All of these systems and facilities must be operable 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ownership and management are both public and private; the federal government has ownership responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures, but the vast majority of the nation's water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by non-federal units of government.
7. A fairly small number of large drinking water and wastewater utilities located primarily in urban areas (about 15% of the systems) provide water services to more than 75% of the U.S. population. Arguably, these systems represent the greatest targets of opportunity for terrorist attacks, while the larger number of small systems that each serve fewer than 10,000 persons are less likely to be perceived as key targets by terrorists who might seek to disrupt water infrastructure systems.
8. Attacks resulting in physical destruction to any of these systems could include disruption of operating or distribution system components, power or telecommunications systems, electronic control systems, and actual damage to reservoirs and pumping stations.

The U.S. Constitution establishes two methods by which Presidents may appoint officers of the United States: either with the advice and consent of the Senate, or unilaterally ""during the Recess of the Senate."" These two constitutional provisions have long served as sources of political tension between Presidents and Congresses.
2. The Recess Appointments Clause authorizes the President to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session. However, the Senate fell seven votes shy of the 60-vote threshold necessary to reach cloture and move to a vote on the nomination.
3. The Senate, at various times during the 112 th Congress, has held ""pro forma"" sessions, which are intended, at least in part, to prevent the existence of a Senate recess sufficient to permit the President to exercise his constitutional authority to unilaterally appoint officers.
4. The pro forma sessions typically consist of a single Senator gaveling in the session and, shortly thereafter, gaveling the session out. On December 17, 2011, the Senate adopted a unanimous consent agreement that scheduled a series of pro forma sessions to occur from December 20, 2011, until January 23, 2012.
5. The pro forma sessions generally have been held every three or four days, and typically consist of a single Senator gaveling in the session and, shortly thereafter, gaveling the session out. On January 4, 2012, despite the periodic pro forma sessions of the Senate, the President, asserting his authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, announced his intent to appoint Cordray to serve as the first CFPB Director and Block, Griffin Jr., and Terrence F.

6. The appointments occurred in the time between pro forma sessions on January 3 and January 6, 2012. The President's actions have proven to be contentious. In addition to their impact on relations between the executive and legislative branches, these appointments also raise a number of significant legal questions regarding the scope of the President's authority under the Recess Appointments Clause and the statutory authorities these individuals may exercise—questions that may spark litigation.

575,"<summary>Source: T rade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) provides federal assistance to workers who involuntarily lose their jobs due to foreign competition. The primary benefits for TAA-eligible workers are funding for training and reemployment services as well as income support while a worker is enrolled in training. Workers may also be eligible for other benefits, including a tax credit equal to a portion of qualified health insurance premiums. Workers age 50 and over may be eligible for Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance, a wage supplement program. After a brief discussion of the program's purpose and most recent reauthorization, this report describes TAA as reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA, Title IV of P.L. 114-27 ). Reduced barriers to international trade are widely acknowledged to offer benefits to consumers in the form of increased choices and lower prices. Expanded trade may also offer expansionary opportunities to firms that produce goods or services that see increased exports. Reduced barriers to trade may, however, have concentrated negative effects on domestic industries and workers that face increased competition. TAA is designed to provide readjustment assistance to workers who suffer dislocation (job loss) due to foreign competition or offshoring. Generally, TAA provides a more robust set of benefits and services than would be available to a worker who lost his or her job for reasons other than foreign competition. TAA is designed to assist workers who have been adversely affected by reduced trade barriers and increased trade. Its availability to workers who are adversely affected by declines in international trade may be limited. TAA was created in 1962 and, historically, has been reauthorized alongside expansionary trade policies. A detailed legislative history of the program is in the Appendix . In June 2015, TAA was reauthorized by TAARA. The eligibility and benefit provisions of TAARA are authorized to continue through June 30, 2021. TAARA was part of a bill that extended other trade-related policies. TAARA was also passed in conjunction with a separate bill that reauthorized the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA, Title I of P.L. 114-26 ).

614,"Summary 1: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide, particularly prevalent in developing countries and males. Risk factors for HCC include chronic liver inflammation, autoimmune hepatitis, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases. HCC is refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations. Currently, systemic therapeutic options in locally advanced or metastatic HCC are limited to sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting RAF kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. The transition from normal hepatocyte to HCC is not fully understood, and hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex multistep process driven by accumulation of heterogeneous molecular alterations from initial hepatocyte injury to metastatic invasion. Dysplastic nodules progress to early HCC through cumulative genetic alterations, while advanced HCC often involves intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein invasion. Molecular alterations implicated in HCC development include mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic alterations, chromosomal changes, and aberrant activation of signaling cascades. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) axis plays a crucial role in tumor progression, serving as a hub for multiple heterogeneous signaling networks and modulating the activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of HGF and cMET [37,41] is observed in 33% and 2048% of HCC samples, respectively, and dysregulated HGF and cMET signaling upregulates protease production and cell dissociation via extracellular matrix degradation, facilitating tumor invasiveness and metastasis. The HGF-CMET axis is implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including the activation of multiple signaling pathways. Overexpression of HGF and cMET [37,41] is observed in 33% and 2048% of HCC samples, respectively, and dysregulated HGF and cMET signaling upregulates protease production and cell dissociation via extracellular matrix degradation, facilitating tumor invasiveness and metastasis.",0,{'n_points': 2}

2. Generally, a relatively low-light reflectivity can be obtained for crystalline silicon solar cells by combining surface texturization with six-nanometer thin-film deposition.
3. However, to further reduce the light reflectivity for the improvement of solar cell efficiency, various nanostructures with size comparable to the wavelength of the light are proposed, such as photonic crystals, porous structures, plasmoids, monics, etc.
4. All these nanostructures should be based on wide-bandgap materials that themselves cannot absorb sunlight.
5. The ZnO material has a wide-bandgap, which has been widely used in fields such as photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices.
6. For photovoltaic applications, the ZnO nanostructures as antireflective layers can be fabricated by various approaches like pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition, vapor-liquid-solid growth, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical deposition technique.

Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a wide range of causes and can roughly be divided into three categories: (1) an imbalance between the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, which is the most frequently observed form; (2) abnormal cerebral development such as partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum and neuronal proliferation / migration disorders; and (3) destructive disease processes leading to loss of neuronal tissue by vascular insults or infectious pathogens.
2. The incidence of additional anomalies detected on fetal MRI following normal ultrasound findings varies greatly between several reported studies and depends on the severity of ventriculomegaly, the expertise of the sonographer, and the selected patient population. The prevalence of ventriculomegaly ranges between 0.3-1.5, with mild cases having a prevalence of 10-12 mm, moderate cases having a prevalence of 12-15 mm, and severe cases having a prevalence of >15 mm.
3. The sensitivity of fetal MRI to detect fetal anomalies is limited by fetal motion, which can affect the image acquisition and spatial resolution. The accuracy of fetal MRI to detect fetal anomalies is high, but the interobserver agreement is low, especially in cases of mild ventriculomegaly.
4. The added value of fetal MRI is difficult to statistically demonstrate due to the lack of postnatal / postmortem (imaging) correlates, uncertainty between the time span between prenatal ultrasound and mri, a lack of ultrasound findings by the fetal MRI specialist, and the lack of data investigating the sonographic detection / confirmation of fetal anomalies following mri scans.
5. The interobserver agreement between experts using the same imaging modality is low, especially in cases of mild ventriculomegaly. The level of subspecialty training of individuals interpreting fetal MRI is significantly improved by pediatric neuroradiologists, which enhances the interobserver agreement.

Although use of the term personalized medicine is often limited to the identification of optimal drug and dosage for subgroup patients, current personalized medicine applications are far more broad and might include situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
5. In contrast, in other instances, genetic profiles may be used to determine preventive interventions.
6. This approach is already used for some forms of hereditary cancer, in which individual genetic testing is the basis for deciding on specific, sometimes very radical interventions such as preventive surgery (Kroll et al., 2008).

658,"<summary>Myosin Va (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton. Each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n- terminal motor domains connected to lever arms, followed by a coiled-coil rod domain, ending in a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis. The lever arms consist of six tandem-helix motifs stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains. Calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova; however, in the presence of high calcium ( > 1 m), motor processivity is reduced and one or more calmodulin molecules may dissociate from each lever arm. Single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro. Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusion search. The structural domains that are critical to myova's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction. Here, we used tethered particle microscopy (TPM) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains. In addition, we hypothesized that calmodulin disassociation from the myova lever arm decreases the lever arm's flexural stiffness, thus contributing to the motor's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium. Various myova constructs, listed as follows, were expressed in the baculovirus/SF9 cell system and purified as described previously. These constructs allowed the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains to be defined by TPM (figure 2). Full-length murine myova (myova-fl) was expressed as was a double-headed short construct (myova-hmm), engineered by truncating the myova-fl heavy chain at residue 1098, followed by a biotin tag and a flag epitope tag at the c-terminus to facilitate purification. Double-headed myova constructs were coexpressed with calcium-insensitive calmodulin (camall) as described previously. Single-headed myova (myova-s1) was truncated at amino acid 908 with a biotin tag at the c-terminus and coexpressed with wild-type calmodulin and purified as described.

659,"1. The study aimed to determine whether clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (eac) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in different proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
2. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aurka (rs2273535), erbb2 (rs1136201), mdm2 (rs2279744), cdh1 (rs5030625), cdkn2a (rs11515), and tp73 (rs2273953) were genotyped in a consecutive cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
3. The association with disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
4. Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients with eac or escc.
5. However, in a multivariate analysis, patients with eac carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t / g genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.450.88], p < 0.007).
6. Patients with eac harboring the homozygous cdh1 (rs5030625) ga / ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.0, 95% CI [1.411], p < 0.008).
7. In a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients, the mdm2 t / g and cdh1 ga / ga genotype confer risk of death in patients with eac.
8. These data suggest that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with eac.

The incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in patients previously treated for breast carcinoma through breast-conserving surgery, systemic adjuvant therapy, and radiation therapy is estimated to be less than 6%. However, each case has different clinical relevance (evolution, prognosis, and therapeutic management), and it is necessary to distinguish between a true local recurrence (TR) of a previous tumor and the appearance of a new primary tumor (NPT). To do this, we must study the location of the new tumor (distance from the previous tumor), staging (by imaging and biopsy), and determine their histological subtype (through immunohistochemical studies and determination of HER2 and hormone receptor expression). Additionally, a 35-year-old premenopausal woman with no relevant medical history of interest, except for a family history of a maternal cousin with breast cancer at age 28, was referred to the oncologic gynecology department by palpation of a 1-cm nodule in the right axilla. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed, with the pathological result of suspicion of malignancy. Immunohistochemical study of the tumor cells showed positive staining for both estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in 50 and 15% of the tumor cells, respectively, and negative membrane staining of HER2 marker. Computer tomography performed after surgical intervention revealed no other organs compromised or distant metastatic extension. Preoperative serum levels of the marker CA-15-3 were normal. With this diagnosis, the patient was referred to our medical oncology department where she received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of adriamycin 60 mg/m and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m every 3 weeks. Then, adjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy) was performed on the right breast residual tissue, followed by adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen 20 mg daily during the following 4 years. Meanwhile, the patient continued routine follow-up visits in our department. In January 2008 (4 years after surgery), the patient noticed the presence of periareolar thickening in the right breast with redness and heat. In the physical examination, mammography showed the presence of breast architectural distortion with high suspicion of malignancy (birads-4).

The prevalence of mucosal changes or lesions in the present study was 64%, which was higher than that of mujica et al. and espinoza et al., who noted a prevalence of 57% and 53%, respectively. However, cebeci et al. observed a prevalence of oral changes to be 15.5% in the elderly patients. The most common lesion in the present study was nicotinic stomatitis (43%), which was higher than the findings of mujica et al. and cebeci et al., who noted leukoplakia to be the most common premalignant lesion (13%). The prevalence of oral cancers, especially squamous cell carcinomas involving the mucosal tissue, is usually evident in the present study. The odds of having a lesion increased with age, even after adjusting for tobacco use, the presence of faulty dentures, race/ethnicity, and sex. The use of prostheses or their condition in the elderly helps to determine the number of oral lesions present in these individuals. The length of denture use and diabetes mellitus can be considered as significant risk factors for denture stomatitis and denture hyperplasia.

2. Chondroblastoma localized in the head and neck region is uncommon but can occur in the temporal bone or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and results in various symptoms such as occlusal abnormalities, trismus, clicking of the TMJ, hearing impairments, dizziness, and otorrhea.
3. Malignant changes in chondroblastoma, although rare, have been observed after irradiation [3, 4]. In order to avoid the inherent risk of malignant progression, radiation therapy should not be considered.
4. Chondroblastoma in the temporal bone has unusual histological features that make diagnosis difficult, and incomplete resection carries a high risk of recurrence [5, 6].
5. Thus, it would seem advisable, provided the diagnosis is accurate, to attempt a complete surgical removal for the curative treatment of chondroblastoma.
6. Following 5 years of unsuccessful treatment, the patient was referred to our department presenting with chronic hearing impairments and subsequently progressive trismus.
7. A tumor mass was present in the middle cranial fossa, including the TMJ and cochlea, in spite of earlier treatment regimens.

703,"1. Preeclampsia (pe) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, complicating 25% of all pregnancies.
2. Proteinuria is clinically diagnosed as pe and associated with increased maternal or neonatal morbidity and mortality compared to gestational hypertension.
3. The incidence of pe increased in China, as the opening of the two-child policy, but there was no indicator of severe pe.
4. Severe pe is often combined with hypoalbuminemia; we hypothesize that hypoalbuminemia may serve as an indicator of the severity of pe.
5. Hypoalbuminemia occurs mainly due to systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged and increased permeability of vascular endothelial cells, leading to large numbers of proteins and liquid leaking in tissue clearance and loss of plasma proteins, causing intravascular dehydration.
6. This intravascular dehydration may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions, which is thought to be a predisposing factor of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet (hellp) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
7. In addition, the reduction of hepatic blood flow due to the production of albumin is decreased in two recent studies, indicating that maintaining adequate blood protein levels during early pregnancy may prevent severe pe.",1,{'n_points': 7}

711,"Summary 1: Nurses have not been adequately involved in national policy development, and applying critical theory perspective in the analysis reveals important health system structures and hierarchy as well as nursing professional factors hindering nurses' participation in policies making processes. These factors must be addressed if nurses' input in policy-making is significantly altered. To enhance nurses' participation in policy processes, the policy-makers should address hierarchies, domination, and gender issues inherent in the health care system and establish mechanisms through which nurses' views could get to national level decision-makers when policies are being formulated. This can be achieved by enacting legislation in Kenya that would allow nurses with leadership and policy competencies to hold senior positions in the health care system like doctors. With governance opportunities created through decentralization of power, there is a need for all health professionals to have equal opportunities to be in leadership and management positions that are embedded within the decision-making structures in the health care system.

2. Biologists must become adept at navigating the vast expanses of genomic DNA data that may seem devoid of features, yet beneath this facade of uniformity are rich veins of knowledge.
3. Surveying and signposting this apparently bland genomic landscape should guide investigators towards experiments that address specific hypotheses about gene function.
4. If the genome is to offer its secrets to all scientific communities, its surveyors need to adopt universal vocabularies.
5. Broadly speaking, there are two common ways of annotating genes: websites such as locuslink, genecards, eugenes, and ensembl integrate information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes.
6. Proteins that are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor are defined as homologs: where additional copies have arisen by gene duplication within a single genome they are defined as paralogs, whereas corresponding genes in different species are orthologs.
7. Homologous gene products have similar tertiary structures and frequently also have similar functions.
8. The surveying and way-marking of each new gene need not always be an arduous process of discovering structure and function from scratch, since clues can be inferred from what has already been experimentally gleaned from its homologs.
9. The first completely sequenced genomes, such as that of haemophilus influenzae, were annotated following searches of all available sequence databases with each predicted gene product.

2. The device was electrostatically actuated and the driving voltage was applied to a side-gate parallel to the resonator.
3. The drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency 2, thus the amplitude of motion of the resonator was proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
4. A bias voltage at (+) through the gauges was used to down-mix their resistance change (occurring at the actuation frequency).
5. Typical measurement values were 1.5 V for the bias voltage at a measurement frequency of 500 kHz.
6. All measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature.
7. Thermomechanical noise was measured using the same set-up, with the drive electrode disconnected.
8. Measurements were taken with a lock-in amplifier, which also generated the drive and bias signals.
9. The Allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
10. The phase of the measured signal (t) was monitored for a certain amount of time and then transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.
11. Close to the resonance frequency, this phase response was linear, f2qf0.
12. Using the complete phase response of the resonator instead of this linearization does not significantly alter the Allan deviation.

2. The dynamic folding of chromatin is crucial for regulating gene expression and DNA replication, and the genome is folded hierarchically into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs).
3. TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions.
4. The replication timing, presence of histone modifications, and expression of genes within TADs are highly correlated.
5. The underlying features that generate invariant tad boundaries remain unknown, with human cells showing association with ctcf, cohesin, dnase I hypersensitivity, and certain histone marks.
6. In drosophila, the combinatorial binding of insulators (also known as architectural proteins) such as beaf32 and tfiiic is associated with the strength of tad boundaries.
7. The boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, thus the most likely interaction partner for a genomic region is another region within the same tad.

776,Summary 1: The study investigates the expression patterns and regulatory roles of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in oral lichen planus (OLP). The research aims to identify whether IL-23/IL-17 is involved in the local pathogenesis of OLP. The study found that both erosive and reticular olp lesions have significantly increased immunostaining scores of IL-23p19 and numbers of IL-17 + cells compared to normal oral mucosa. The data also revealed that the overexpression of IL-23 in olp lesions contributes to the induction of th17 and the production of IL-17. The study suggests that IL-23/IL-17 axis may be involved in the early stages of OLP lesion progression. The data also indicate that the overexpression of IL-23 may be an early event in the pathogenesis of OLP lesion and may be maintained at a high level in the later stages of lesion development.,0,{'n_points': 2}

Healthcare innovation and evidence-based practices have expanded rapidly over the past fifty years, with the number of scientific papers published doubling over 10 years. Studies indicate that 5 questions per hospitalized patient and 2 questions per outpatient patient are raised for physicians. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a new paradigm that attempts to direct clinical services and care toward effective, efficient services with minimal complications and errors. EBM is influential in filling the knowledge gap in helping physicians find the best evidence for patients care. Thus, it is a systematic approach for solving clinical problems which allows integration of available best evidence with clinical experience and preferences and values of the patients. The main challenge today is transfer and translation of knowledge which help physicians to make the best clinical decisions based on the best evidence in the minimum time. <summary>Healthcare System and Evidence-Based Practice</summary>
