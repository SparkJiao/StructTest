0," To find out how many eggs Janet has left to sell after consuming some for breakfast and using for baking muffins, we first need to determine the number of eggs she lays daily and then subtract the ones she uses for her personal consumption and baking.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, she uses a total of 7 eggs per day.

Therefore, the number of eggs she has left to sell is:
16 eggs/day (Janet lays) - 3 eggs/day (for breakfast) - 4 eggs/day (for baking muffins) = 9 eggs/day

Now that we know Janet sells 9 eggs daily at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, we can calculate her daily earnings:

Daily earnings = Number of eggs sold * Price per egg
Daily earnings = 9 eggs/day * $2/egg = $18/day

Result: Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1," To find the total number of bolts of fiber required to make a robe, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, and half that much white fiber. So, the amount of white fiber is half of the amount of blue fiber.

Let's denote the number of bolts of blue fiber as x. Then, the number of bolts of white fiber is x/2.

The total number of bolts required is the sum of the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:

Total bolts = Bolts of blue fiber + Bolts of white fiber

Substituting the expressions for the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber, we get:

Total bolts = x + x/2

To simplify this expression, we can use the common factor of x:

Total bolts = x(1 + 1/2)

Now, we can simplify the fraction 1/2 by multiplying it by the reciprocal of 1, which is 1:

Total bolts = x(1 + 1)/1

Total bolts = x(2)/1

Total bolts = 2x

So, the robe takes a total of 2 bolts of fiber (either blue or a combination of blue and white). Since the question asks for the total number of bolts, it doesn't matter if we specify that they are blue or a combination of blue and white. Therefore, the final result is:

\boxed{2}

2," To find the profit that Josh made from flipping the house, we first need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. We know that the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. So, we can calculate the new value by adding the original price of the house to the cost of repairs and then finding 150% of that sum.

First, let's calculate the cost of the repairs as a percentage of the original price:

Cost of repairs as a percentage of original price = Cost of repairs / Original price
Cost of repairs as a percentage of original price = $50,000 / $80,000
Cost of repairs as a percentage of original price = 0.625

Now, we can calculate the new value of the house:

New value = Original price + Cost of repairs * 1.5
New value = $80,000 + $50,000 * 1.5
New value = $80,000 + $75,000
New value = $155,000

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the original price and the cost of repairs from the new value:

Profit = New value - Original price - Cost of repairs
Profit = $155,000 - $80,000 - $50,000
Profit = $125,000

The final answer is $125,000.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

4," To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens in a day.

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens in a day is:

15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups

Now, we know that Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken receives three cups of feed per day. So, the total amount of feed Wendi needs to have on hand to feed her chickens for one day is:

Total feed needed = Number of chickens * Cups of feed per chicken per day
Total feed needed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Since Wendi already gives her chickens 40 cups of feed during the morning and afternoon meals, she needs to give them an additional 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day to meet their daily requirement. Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{20} cups.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
5," To calculate the total cost of the glasses that Kylar wants to buy, we need to determine how many glasses cost the regular price of $5 and how many cost 60% of that price. Let's denote the number of regular-priced glasses as x and the number of discounted glasses as y.

We know that the total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is 16, so:

x + y = 16

Now, let's find the cost of regular-priced glasses and discounted glasses:

Cost of regular-priced glasses = $5 * x
Cost of discounted glasses = $5 * 0.6 * y

The total cost of all the glasses is the sum of the cost of regular-priced glasses and discounted glasses:

Total cost = $5 * x + $5 * 0.6 * y

Since we want to find the total cost, we need to solve the equation x +y = 16 for x and y. One way to do this is by using the method of substitution. We can find the value of x when y = 15 (since 16 - 1 = 15):

x + 15 = 16
x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can find y:

1 + y = 16
y = 15

So, Kylar needs to buy 1 regular-priced glass and 15 discounted glasses. The cost of regular-priced glasses is $5, and the cost of discounted glasses is $5 * 0.6 = $3. Therefore, the total cost of the glasses is:

Total cost = $5 + $3 * 15 = $5 + $45 = $50 + $40 = $90

7," First, let's calculate how long it takes Carla to download 40% of the file at her normal download speed: 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

However, the download was interrupted for 20 minutes due to the Windows update installation. So, the actual time Carla spent downloading before the interruption was 40 minutes - 20 minutes = 60 minutes or 1 hour.

Since Carla had to restart the download from the beginning, she will need to spend an additional hour downloading the remaining 60 GB (100% - 40% = 60%) of the file.

8," To find the distance John traveled during each segment of his trip and the total distance, we need to calculate the distance covered in each part of the journey.

First, let's find the distance John drove during the first 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance1 = Speed * Time
Distance1 = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance1 = 180 miles

Next, let's find the distance John didn't cover during the 2 hours of standstill traffic:
Distance2_not_covered = Speed * Time
Distance2_not_covered = 0 mph * 2 hours
Distance2_not_covered = 0 miles

Since John didn't cover any distance during the 2 hours of traffic, we need to subtract the time spent in traffic from the total time he intended to spend traveling and find the distance he would have covered if he hadn't encountered the traffic:

Total Time = 3 hours (driving) + 2 hours (traffic) + 0.5 hours (30 mph) + 1.5 hours (80 mph)
Total Time = 7 hours

Now, let's find the distance John would have covered if he hadn't encountered the traffic:
Distance2 = Speed * Time
Distance2 = 60 mph * 4 hours
Distance2 = 240 miles

Since John didn't cover 2 hours of the intended 4 hours, we need to find the distance he covered during the remaining 2.5 hours:

Distance3 = Speed * Time
Distance3 = 80 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance3 = 120 miles

Finally, we can find the distance John is from home at the end of the 4 hours by subtracting the distance he didn't cover during the traffic from the total distance he intended to travel:

The final answer is: Distance from home = Distance2 - Distance2_not_covered = 240 miles - 0 miles = 240 miles.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
9," To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we first need to find out how many hours she worked regularly (40 hours) and how many hours she worked overtime (5 hours).

For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour. So her earnings for the regular hours are:

Regular earnings = Hours worked * Regular hourly rate
Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour
Regular earnings = $400

For the overtime hours (5 hours), Eliza earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. So her earnings for the overtime hours are:

Overtime earnings = Hours worked * Overtime hourly rate
Overtime earnings = 5 hours * ($10/hour * 1.2)
Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12
Overtime earnings = $60

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for this week are:

Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $400 + $60

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in a week:
   She eats 3 eggs every morning, so:
   Eggs per week = Eggs per day * Days per week
   = 3 eggs * 7 days
   = 21 eggs

2. Next, we need to convert the number of eggs she eats in a week to dozens:
   Eggs per dozen = 12 eggs
   Eggs per week in dozens = Eggs per week / Eggs per dozen

She walked the first 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour (since that's her desired average speed), so the time it took her to cover that distance was 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.

She walked the next 2 miles at a speed of less than 4 miles per hour (since she took 1 hour to cover those 2 miles), so her speed during that segment was 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour.

The total distance Marissa has covered so far is 4 miles (first segment) + 2 miles (second segment) = 6 miles. The total time she spent hiking is 1 hour (first segment) + 1 hour (second segment) = 2 hours.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time it will take her to cover those 6 miles at her desired speed of 4 miles per hour: 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

Since she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours. Therefore, her speed during that segment must be 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

For the orange drink, we know that it is two-thirds water, so the amount of water is 2/3 * 10 liters = 6.67 liters.

For the pineapple drink, we know that it is three-fifths water, so the amount of water is 3/5 * 15 liters = 9 liters.

Now, let's add the amounts of water in both drinks: 6.67 liters (orange drink) + 9 liters (pineapple drink) = 15.67 liters.

However, we started with 24 liters of total volume, so we need to find the difference between the total volume and the spilled liter: 24 liters - 1 liter = 23 liters.

Samantha's age = 31
Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6 = 25

Next, we need to find out how old Raymond was when he had his son. We know that Raymond was 23 when he had his son. So, we can find the number of years between Raymond's age when Samantha was born and when he had his son by subtracting the age at which Raymond had his son from Raymond's age when Samantha was born:

Raymond's age when Samantha was born = 25
Age difference between Raymond and his son = 23 - (current age of Raymond when finding this difference)

We don't know the current age of Raymond when finding this difference, but we do know that Raymond was 23 when he had his son. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

23 = 25 - (current age of Raymond when finding this difference)

To solve for the current age of Raymond when finding this difference, we can add 23 to both sides of the equation:

23 + 23 = 25 + (current age of Raymond when finding this difference)
46 = current age of Raymond when finding this difference

Now that we know Raymond was 46 when his son was born, we can find the number of years between Samantha's birth and her cousin's birth by subtracting the age of Samantha from Raymond's age when his son was born:

Discount = 0.25 * x

We also know that the discount amount is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

$19.50 = 0.25 * x

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk, each costing $3, is $15 (5 * $3).
The cost of 4 apples, each costing $1.50, is $6 (4 * $1.50).

So the total cost of the milk, chicken meal, and apples is $23 ($12 + $15 + $6).

Marie paid a total of $50. So the cost of the pizza boxes is $27 ($50 - $23).

Since each pizza box costs $8.50, we can find the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered by dividing the total cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each pizza box:

Number of pizza boxes = Total cost of pizza boxes / Cost of each pizza box
Number of pizza boxes = $27 / $8.50

To get the exact number of pizza boxes, we need to perform the division as a decimal and then round to the nearest whole number if necessary.

30," To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to determine Darrell's and Allen's current ages based on their age ratio of 7:11 and their total age of 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as D and Allen's age as A. We know that their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, so we can write the equation:

D = 7x
A = 11x

Their total age is 162, so:

D + A = 162
7x + 11x = 162

Combining the terms with the same variable:

18x = 162
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

D = 7 * 9 = 63
A = 11 * 9 = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 years to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109

31," To find the average of the guesses, we first need to convert each guess into the same unit. Since the first guess is in hundreds, we'll convert the other two guesses into hundreds as well.

The second friend said ""20 more than half the first one,"" which is equivalent to ""100 + 20 = 120.""

The third friend said ""25% more than the first one,"" which is equivalent to ""80 * 1.25 = 100 * 1.25 = 125.""

Now that all three guesses are in hundreds, we can find the average by adding them together and dividing by the number of guesses:

Average = (Guess 1 + Guess 2 + Guess 3) / Number of Guesses

Average = (80 + 120 + 125) / 3

Average = 325 / 3

32," To find out how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week, we first need to calculate how many hours it takes him to take care of one dog per day, and then multiply that by the number of dogs he has and the number of days in a week.

Hours per day for one dog = 0.5 hours

So, the total hours John spends taking care of all 10 dogs per day is:

Total hours per day = Hours per day for one dog * Number of dogs
Total hours per day = 0.5 hours * 10
Total hours per day = 5 hours

Now, to find out how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs per week, we need to multiply the total hours per day by the number of days in a week, which is 7:

33," Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So we have two equations:

1) S + G = 110 (total number of coins)
2) G = S +30 (number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins)

Now we can substitute the expression for G from the second equation into the first equation:

S + (S+30) = 110

Combining the terms with S, we get:

2S + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:

2S = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we find the number of silver coins:

S = 40

Now we can find the number of gold coins using the expression we found earlier:

First, let's calculate the number of points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes:

Points in second 20 minutes = Points in first 20 minutes * 1.25
                                            = 4 points * 1.25
                                            = 5 points * 1.2
                                            = 6 points

Now, we can find the total number of points Mike scored by adding the points he scored in both halves:

Total points = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes

37," To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he makes from selling all of them and how much money he spends on video games.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so he makes a total of:

13 Lego sets * $15/set = $195

Next, John buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends a total of:

8 video games * $20/game = $160

The difference between the amount of money John makes from selling the Lego sets and the amount he spends on video games is $5. Therefore, John must have had $195 - $160 = $35 extra money.

Since John only had $5 extra money, it means that he had $30 less than what he earned from selling the Lego sets. This means that John sold 30 / $15 = 2 additional Lego sets beyond the 13 sets he originally had.

So, he runs for 3 hours + 3 hours/2 = 3 hours + 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours in total per week. Since he runs 3 days a week, his total weekly running time is 4.5 hours/day * 3 days/week = 13.5 hours/week.

Now, we can find out how fast John runs by dividing the total distance he covers in a week by the total number of hours he spends running. We know that John runs 60 miles a week.

1. R = 4W (Dana can run four times faster than she can walk)
2. Skipping speed = 0.5R (Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run)
3. Skipping speed = 3 miles per hour

From the third condition, we can find the walking speed:

W = Skipping speed / 2
W = 3 miles per hour / 2
W = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we can find the running speed:

R = 4W
R = 4 * 1.5 miles per hour
R = 6 miles per hour

Next, we need to find the time Dana spends running and walking during six hours:

Running time = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
Walking time = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana travels during each activity:

Running distance = Running speed * Running time
Running distance = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Running distance = 12 miles

Walking distance = Walking speed * Walking time
Walking distance = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Walking distance = 6 miles

Finally, we can find the total distance Dana travels during six hours:

41," To find out how far Polly can stand from the dragon while holding the sapphire gemstone and still be able to hit it with the gold javelin, we first need to determine the increased distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

The javelin can be thrown a distance of 400 feet without the gemstone. With the gemstone, Polly can throw it three times farther, so:

Distance with the gemstone = 400 feet * 3
Distance with the gemstone = 1200 feet

Now, we need to make sure that this distance is far enough to be outside the reach of the dragon's flames, which have a range of 1000 feet.

Comparing the two distances:

1000 feet (dragon's flame reach) > 1200 feet (Polly's javelin throw with the gemstone)

Since the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is greater than the dragon's flame reach, she can safely stand and throw the javelin from a position beyond the dragon's flames to hit it.

Calories left for chips = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Calories left for chips = 2000 - 1800
Calories left for chips = 200

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat within the given calorie limit. We know that each serving of the chips has 250 calories, so we can calculate the number of servings you can have based on the remaining calories.

Number of servings = Calories left for chips / Calories per serving
Number of servings = 200 / 250
Number of servings ≈ 0.8

Since you cannot eat a fraction of a serving, you can only have one more serving, which is 250 calories. To find out how many grams of chips that corresponds to, we can use the calorie-to-gram ratio for chips, which is approximately 1 gram per calorie.

Grams of chips for one serving = Calories per serving
Grams of chips for one serving = 250 calories
Grams of chips for one serving = 250 grams

Since you can have one more serving, the total grams of chips you can eat is:

Next, we know that Charlie can make 10 tapered candles with 1 pound of beeswax. So, the cost to make one candle is $10.00 / 10 = \boxed{\$1.00}.

Since Charlie wants to make and sell 20 candles, the total cost of supplies will be 20 * $1.00 = \boxed{\$20.00}.

The total cost of blue ties is $200, so the total cost of red ties is 2x * $60. The total cost of all ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties:

$200 + 2x * $60

To simplify this expression, we can first find the cost of one red tie in terms of the cost of one blue tie: $60 = 1.5 * $40. Therefore, $60 = $60 / $40 * $40 = 1.5 * $40.

Now we can express the cost of red ties in terms of the cost of blue ties: 2x * $60 = 2x * 1.5 * $40 = 3x * $40.

The total cost of all ties is $200 + 3x * $40. To find the value of x, we can set up an equation:

$200 + 3x * $40 = 3x * $80

Now we can solve for x:

$200 = 3x * ($40 - $40) + 3x * $40
$200 = 3x * $40
x = $200 / (3 * $40) = $200 / $120 = 5/3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a tie, this means that John bought 5/3 sets of ties, each set containing both red and blue ties. However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a set, this situation is not possible.

51," Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour in the forward direction and 6 miles per hour in the reverse direction. Let's first find out how long it takes him to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM.

To calculate the time it takes to travel a certain distance at a constant speed, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, we need to find the distance Tom travels during this time. Since we don't have the exact distance, let's assume Tom travels a certain distance ""d"" miles during the 3-hour period from 1 PM to 4 PM.

Time (forward) = d / 10

Now, we need to find the time it takes Tom to travel back with a speed of 6 miles per hour.

Distance (back) = 2 * d (since the distance traveled in each direction is the same)
Time (back) = d / 6

Since the total time Tom spends traveling is the sum of the time spent traveling in each direction, we have:

Total Time = Time (forward) + Time (back)

Substituting the expressions for Time (forward) and Time (back) into the equation, we get:

Total Time = (d / 10) + (d / 6)

To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator for the fractions in the equation, which is 30.

Total Time = (3d / 30) + (5d / 30)
Total Time = (3d + 5d) / 30
Total Time = 8d / 30

To get rid of the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

Total Time = 4d / 15

Now, we don't have a specific value for ""d,"" so we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we have found that the total time Tom spends traveling is a function of the distance ""d"" he travels during the 3-hour period from 1 PM to 4 PM.

52," To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to determine how many pounds of toys he currently has in his bag. We know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we can calculate the number of toys by dividing the total weight of the toys by the weight of each toy.

Let's call the number of toys ""t"" and the total weight of the toys ""T"". We know that Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag, so the current weight of the toys is:

T = weight of comic books + weight of toys - weight to be removed
T = (number of comic books * weight of each comic book) + (number of toys * weight of each toy) - 15

We know that Uriah has removed 30 comic books, which weigh a total of 15 pounds (30 * 1/4). So we can set up the equation as follows:

15 = (30 * 1/4) + (t * 1/2) - 15

Solving for ""t"" (the number of toys):

t = (15 - 15)/(1/2) + 30 * 1/4
t = 30

However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it would mean that Uriah doesn't need to remove any toys at all. This is likely due to a mistake in the problem statement or in the given weights.

57," To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to determine the weight of the truck with the boxes.

The weight of the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, the weight of one box and the truck with that box is the sum of the weight of the truck and the weight of the box.

Weight of one box and the truck = Weight of the truck + Weight of one box
Weight of one box and the truck = 3755 pounds + 15 pounds
Weight of one box and the truck = 3770 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds.

Number of boxes = Total weight allowed by the bridge / Weight of one box and the truck
Number of boxes = 5000 pounds / 3770 pounds per box and truck

Number of boxes ≈ 1.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 1.

However, since we cannot load just one box, we need to add the weight of the driver and the empty truck to find the actual weight we can have on the bridge.

Total weight on the bridge = Weight of the truck + Weight of the driver + Weight of the boxes
Total weight on the bridge = 3755 pounds + 150 pounds (weight of the driver) + (Number of boxes * Weight of one box)

Total weight on the bridge = 3755 pounds + 150 pounds + (1 * 15 pounds)
Total weight on the bridge = 3880 pounds

The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 1, and the actual weight on the bridge will be 3880 pounds.

58," To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we first need to calculate the cost of the groceries before any additional fees were added. We know that Stephen was charged $40.00 for his groceries.

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee and the tip. The delivery fee was $3.00, and the tip was $4.00.

The delivery fee was a percentage of the total cost, so we need to find out how much the groceries cost before the delivery fee was added. We can do this by dividing the total cost by one minus the delivery fee percentage:

Total cost = Groceries cost + Delivery fee + Tip

$40.00 = Groceries cost + $3.00 + $4.00

Groceries cost = $40.00 - $3.00 - $4.00

Groceries cost = $33.00

Now we can calculate the total cost with the delivery fee and the tip:

Total cost = Groceries cost + Delivery fee + Tip

Total cost = $33.00 + $3.00 + $4.00

Total cost = $39.00

However, we know that the total cost was $40.00, so there seems to be a discrepancy. Let's check our calculations.

We calculated the delivery fee as a percentage of the total cost, but we should have calculated it as a percentage of the groceries cost. The delivery fee was 25% of the groceries cost, so we need to find out how much the groceries cost before the delivery fee was added:

Total cost = Groceries cost + Delivery fee + Tip

$40.00 = $33.00 + Delivery fee + $4.00

Delivery fee = $40.00 - $33.00 - $4.00

Delivery fee = $3.00

Now we can calculate the total cost with the correct delivery fee:

Total cost = Groceries cost + Delivery fee + Tip

Total cost = $33.00 + $3.00 + $4.00

Total cost = $39.00

So the final price of Stephen's groceries was $39.00.

Now, let's calculate the number of good oranges:
Total number of oranges = 25
Number of bad oranges = 1
Number of sour oranges = 2
Number of unripe oranges = 5

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Number of bad oranges - Number of sour oranges - Number of unripe oranges

First, let's calculate the amount she pays in the first half of the year:

Amount paid in the first half = Monthly charge * Number of months
Amount paid in the first half = $140 * 6
Amount paid in the first half = $840

Next, let's calculate the amount she pays in the second half of the year. We know that she pays 10% less than the original amount, so we'll calculate the original amount for the second half and then subtract 10%:

Original amount for the second half = Monthly charge * Number of months
Original amount for the second half = $140 * 6
Original amount for the second half = $840

Amount paid in the second half = Original amount for the second half * (1 - 0.1)
Amount paid in the second half = $840 * 0.9
Amount paid in the second half = $756

Finally, let's calculate the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year:

First, let's calculate her fuel efficiency:
Fuel efficiency = Total miles driven / Gallons of gas used

We know that she traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas. So,
Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency = 25 miles per gallon (mpg)

Now, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas by multiplying her fuel efficiency by the number of gallons in her tank:

Miles per tank = Fuel efficiency * Gallons in tank
Miles per tank = 25 mpg * 12 gallons

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35

We're given that there are 175 diamonds. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Now, we know that there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, we can set up another equation:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies

Substituting the number of rubies we found earlier, we get:

1. The total cost of the five cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is: $150 x 5 = $750.
2. A 2% interest rate will be charged for each cell phone, so the total interest paid is: $750 x 0.02 = $15.
3. Therefore, the total amount Shiela will pay is: $750 + $15 = $765.

Now, we need to divide the total amount by the number of months to find out how much she will pay each month: $765 / 3 = $255.

However, this result is not accurate since it includes the extra dollar from the rounding in the calculation. To get the correct answer, we should calculate the total cost without rounding and then divide by 3:

1. The total cost of the five cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is: $150 x 5 = $750.
2. A 2% interest rate will be charged for each cell phone, so the total interest paid is: $750 x 0.02 = $15.
3. The total amount Shiela will pay is: $750 + $15 = $765.
4. Dividing the total amount by 3 months, we get: $765 / 3 = $255.17 (rounded).

75," To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to determine the square footage of each level and then find the average.

Let's denote the side length of each level as s. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can write the following equation:

s^2_1 = 16
s^2_2 = 16 / 2 = 8
s^2_3 = 8 / 2 = 4
s^2_4 = 4 / 2 = 2

From this pattern, we can see that the side length of each level is the square root of half the square footage of the level above it. So, the side length of each level is:

s_1 = √16 = 4
s_2 = √8 = 2√2
s_3 = √4 = 2
s_4 = √2

To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the average of the areas of each level. The area of each level is the side length squared:

Area_1 = s^2_1 = 16
Area_2 = s^2_2 = 8
Area_3 = s^2_3 = 4
Area_4 = s^2_4 = 2

The total area of the sandcastle is the sum of the areas of all levels:

Total Area = Area_1 + Area_2 + Area_3 + Area_4 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total area by the number of levels:

Next, let's calculate the amount of dog food she needs for the rest of its life, assuming a year has 365 days:
2 cups/day * (365 days - 180 days) = 364 cups

Now, let's find out how many bags of dog food she needs for each stage:

1. The first alarm rang four times.
2. The second alarm rang for three times the duration of the first alarm. Let's call the duration of the first alarm ""x"" seconds. So, the second alarm rang for 3x seconds.
3. The third alarm rang for half the duration of the second alarm, which is (1/2) * 3x = 1.5x seconds.

Now, let's find the total number of rings. Since the alarm rings continuously until Greg turns it off, we can equate the duration of each alarm to the number of rings and their respective durations:

1. The first alarm rang for x seconds and rang 4 times.
2. The second alarm rang for 3x seconds and also rang 4 times (since the rings continue until Greg turns it off).
3. The third alarm rang for 1.5x seconds and also rang 4 times.

To find the total number of rings, we can sum up the number of rings during each alarm instance:

Total rings = 4 (from the first alarm) + 4 (from the second alarm) + 4 (from the third alarm)

However, since the third alarm rang for half the duration of the second alarm, we need to account for that in our calculation. We know that the duration of the third alarm is 1.5x, so the number of rings during the third alarm is:

Rings during the third alarm = (Duration of the third alarm) / (Duration of one ring)

We don't know the exact duration of one ring, but we can express the number of rings during the third alarm in terms of x:

Rings during the third alarm = (1.5x) / x = 1.5

Since the third alarm rang 1.5 times the number of rings during the first alarm, the total number of rings is:

Total rings = 4 + 4 * 3 + 4 * 1.5 = 16 + 12 = 28

So, the answer is:

87," To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary increase after five years and then her salary after eight years.

First, let's calculate her salary increase after five years:

Salary increase = Initial salary * Percentage increase
Salary increase = $600 * 0.10
Salary increase = $600 * 0.01
Salary increase = $60

Now, let's calculate her salary after five years:

New salary = Initial salary + Salary increase
New salary = $600 + $60
New salary = $660

Next, we'll calculate her salary increase after eight years:

Salary increase = New salary * Percentage increase
Salary increase = $660 * 0.10
Salary increase = $660 * 0.01
Salary increase = $66

Finally, let's calculate her salary after eight years:

Annual salary = New salary + Salary increase
Annual salary = $660 + $66

89," To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags for her 16 friends, we first need to determine how many gift bags she will actually need. Since 1/4 of her guests don't show up, that means 3 of her friends won't be able to attend. So, she will have 13 friends attending the party.

Next, we calculate how many gift bags she will need for these 13 friends:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests * Gift bags per guest
= 13 * 0.75
= 9.75

Since Christina can't buy a fraction of a gift bag, she will need to buy an additional gift bag for the fractional part:

Total number of gift bags = Ceiling(Number of gift bags needed)
= Ceiling(9.75)
= 10

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the gift bags:

Total cost = Number of gift bags * Cost per gift bag
= 10 * $2
= $20

So, Christina will spend $20 on gift bags for her friends' birthday party.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
90," To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring for the dinosaur picnic, we first need to calculate the amount of potato salad required for the adults and the children separately, and then add those amounts together.

The amount of potato salad for adults:
10 lbs per adult
20 adults
---------------------
20 adults * 10 lbs = 200 lbs

The amount of potato salad for children:
5 lbs per child (half the amount for adults)
5 children
---------------------
5 children * 5 lbs = 25 lbs

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad for adults and children to find the total amount Ted needs to bring:

Total amount of potato salad:
200 lbs for adults
25 lbs for children
---------------------
225 lbs in total

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the dinosaur picnic to ensure that everyone is fed.

2. M = Cindy's number of pets + 2
3. Cindy has 4 pets

From point 2, we can find the number of pets Marcia has: M = 4 + 2 = 6.

Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, we can find the number of pets Jan has: J = 3 * M = 3 * 6 = 18.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three of them have is: M + J + Cindy's pets = 6 + 18+ 4 = \boxed{28}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
92," To find the age of Jackson, we need to use the given information to figure out the age difference between each sibling.

We know that:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson
2. Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey
3. Corey is 1 year older than James

Let's start by finding the age difference between Corey and Amy:

Corey's age = Amy's age - 5
Corey's age = (Jackson's age + 5) - 5
Corey's age = Jackson's age

Now we know that Corey and Jackson are the same age. Since Corey is 1 year older than James, we can find James' age:

James' age = Corey's age - 1
James' age = Jackson's age - 1

Finally, we can find Jackson's age by using the information about Amy being 5 years older than Jackson:

Jackson's age = Amy's age - 5

Since we know that Corey and Jackson are the same age, we can use Corey's age as a substitute:

Jackson's age = Corey's age - 5
Jackson's age = Jackson's age - 5

To find the difference between Corey's and Jackson's ages, we can use the information about Amy being 2 years younger than Corey and 5 years older than Jackson:

Corey's age - Jackson's age = Amy's age - Corey's age - Jackson's age
Corey's age - Jackson's age = (Corey's age - 2) - (Jackson's age + 5)
Corey's age - Jackson's age = Corey's age - 2 - Jackson's age - 5
Corey's age - Jackson's age = Corey's age - 7 - Jackson's age

Since we know that Corey and Jackson are the same age, this equation should equal zero:

Corey's age - Jackson's age = 0
Corey's age - 7 - Jackson's age = 0
Corey's age - 7 = Jackson's age

Now we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 7 from Corey's age:

Jackson's age = Corey's age - 7
Jackson's age = Jackson's age - 7

This result doesn't make sense because we used the same variable for both Corey and Jackson. Let's try to find Corey's age instead:

Corey's age = Jackson's age
Corey's age = Corey's age
Corey's age - Jackson's age = Corey's age - Corey's age
Corey's age - Jackson's age = -(Corey's age - Jackson's age)
Corey's age - Jackson's age = -(Corey's age - 0 - Jackson's age)
Corey's age - Jackson's age = -Corey's age + Jackson's age
Corey's age = Jackson's age + Corey's age
Corey's age = 2 * Jackson's age

Now we can find Jackson's age by using the information about him being 10 and 1 year younger than Corey:

Jackson's age = Corey's age / 2 - 1
Jackson's age = 2 * Jackson's age / 2 - 1
Jackson's age = Jackson's age - 1

We can now solve for Jackson's age:

Jackson's age = (Corey's age + 1) / 2
Jackson's age = (2 * Jackson's age + 1) / 2
Jackson's age = (2 * (Jackson's age + 1 / 2)) / 2
Jackson's age = (Jackson's age + 1 / 2)
Jackson's age = Jackson's age + 1 / 2
Jackson's age = Jackson's age + 0.5

Finally, we can find Jackson's age by adding 0.5 to his age:

Jackson's age = Jackson's age + 0.5
Jackson's age = Jackson's age + 1 / 2
Jackson's age = Jackson's age + 0.5 * 2
Jackson's age = Jackson's age + 1

So, Jackson is 1 year older than we initially thought. The final answer is:

Now, Gerald's running time improved by 10%, which means he gained back 1/5 of Lee's initial advantage. Let's calculate Gerald's new running time:

Gerald's improvement = 1/5 * Lee's advantage
Gerald's improvement = 1/5 * 2 seconds
Gerald's improvement = 0.4 seconds

To find Gerald's new running time, we subtract his improvement from Lee's initial time:

Number of cats = Number of dogs * 2
Number of cats = 60 * 2
Number of cats = 120

Now we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the total number of pets, which includes both cats and dogs. So, the total number of pets is:

Number of girls = Total students * Proportion of girls
Number of girls = 200 * (2/3)
Number of girls = 200 * (2/3) * (3/2)
Number of girls = 200 * 1.5
Number of girls = 300

However, we have counted each girl twice - once as a girl and once as a member of the girl scout. So, we need to subtract the number of girls in the girl scout to get the number of girls not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 300 - 200 * (2/3)
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 300 - 200 * (2) / (3)
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 300 - 200 * 2/3
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 300 - 400/3
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 300 - 133.33 (approximately)

97," To find out how many tomatoes Freda used in her last batch of tomato sauce, we first need to determine how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes she used. We know that each can contains three tomatoes and that her sauce made 32 ounces.

First, let's calculate how many ounces are in one tomato. Since there are three tomatoes in a 16-ounce can, we can find the ounce equivalent of one tomato by dividing the total ounces in a can by the number of tomatoes:

1 tomato = 16 oz / 3 tomatoes
1 tomato = ⅔ oz

Now, we can find out how many cans Freda used by dividing the total ounces of sauce she made by the ounce equivalent of one tomato:

Total ounces of sauce = 32 oz
Number of cans = Total ounces of sauce / Ounces per tomato
Number of cans = 32 oz / (⅔ oz/tomato)
Number of cans = 32 oz * (1 tomato / ⅔ oz)
Number of cans ≈ 48.3 tomatoes

Since Freda cannot use a fraction of a can, she must have used 49 cans (rounding up) to make 32 ounces of sauce.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes used:

Total tomatoes = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can
Total tomatoes = 49 cans * 3 tomatoes/can
Total tomatoes = 147 tomatoes

First, let's find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in total:

1. In the first 15 minutes, there were X cars that drove through.
2. In the remaining 15 minutes, there were 20 more cars that drove through.
3. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is X + 20.

Now, let's find out how many cars didn't go through the traffic jam by taking an exit:

1. There were 5 cars that took an exit.

To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can use the following equation:

X = Total number of cars that drove through - Number of cars that took an exit
X = (X + 20) - 5

Solving for X:
X = (X + 20) - 5
X = X + 15

100," To find out how many doorbell rings each friend made, we first need to determine the number of rings for the first three friends.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 * 1.25 = \boxed{25} times.
3. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 * x, where x is the number of rings the fourth friend made.

To find the number of rings the fourth friend made (x), we know that the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more, so:

60 + 10 * x = 20 * 1.25 + 20

Solving for x:

60 + 10x = 25.2 + 20
60 + 10x = 45.2
10x = 45.2 - 60

On weekends, John replaces one of his glasses of water with a glass of soda during dinner. So, the number of glasses of water he drinks on weekends is:

3 meals/day * 2 glasses/meal (1 water and 1 soda) * 2 days/week = 6 glasses/week

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays to the number he drinks on weekends:

15 glasses/week (weekdays) + 6 glasses/week (weekends) = 21 glasses/week

However, since John has an extra glass of water before he goes to bed every day, we need to add that to our calculation as well:

106," To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we first need to calculate the volume of one box without considering the thickness of the walls. The dimensions of one box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular box is:

Volume = length * width * height

So, the volume of one box is:

Volume of one box = 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches
                             = 120 cubic inches

Now, since the walls have a thickness of 1 inch, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of each box to find the inner volume. The total volume of one box, including the walls, is:

Total volume of one box = (length + 2 * wall thickness) * (width + 2 * wall thickness) * (height + 2 * wall thickness)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total volume of one box = (5 inches +2 * 1 inch) * (6 inches + 2 * 1 inch) * (4 inches + 2 * 1 inch)
                                      = 135 cubic inches

The difference between the total volume and the volume without the walls gives us the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Total volume of one box - Volume of one box
                                       = 135 cubic inches - 120 cubic inches

111," To find out how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore, we first need to determine her rowing speed in feet per second. We know that it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, so:

Rowing speed = Distance / Time
Rowing speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Rowing speed = 1.25 feet/second

Next, we need to find out how long it took Julia to row 64 feet (the distance to the shore). We can calculate this by dividing the total distance by her rowing speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 64 feet / 1.25 feet/second
Time = 51.2 seconds

Since Julia can't row for a fraction of a second, we'll round up to the next whole number, which is 52 seconds.

Now, we know that the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet rowed. So, to find out how much water was taken on in total, we need to calculate the distance Julia rowed and then convert that distance to liters:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 1.25 feet/second * 52 seconds
Distance = 65 feet

Since Julia rowed an additional 10 feet beyond the shore, the total distance she rowed was 75 feet. We know that the boat took on two liters of water for every ten feet, so we can calculate the number of ten-foot intervals and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per interval:

Number of ten-foot intervals = Total distance / Distance per interval
Number of ten-foot intervals = 75 feet / 10 feet
Number of ten-foot intervals = 7.5

Since Julia can't take on half a liter of water, we'll round up to the next whole number, which is 8 intervals.

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the number of intervals by the amount of water taken on per interval:

Total water = Number of intervals * Water per interval

114," To find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, we first need to determine how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs and that it can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold:

1800 photographs for Jamal's phone
-------------------------------------
6 times fewer photographs for Brittany's phone

Brittany's phone can hold:

1800 photographs / 6 = 300 photographs

Now we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

300 photographs for Brittany's phone
-------------------------------------
50 times fewer ducks in Jamal's photograph

Number of ducks = 300 photographs / 50
Number of ducks = 6 ducks

However, this result doesn't make much sense since we started with the assumption that Jamal's photograph contains many more ducks than can fit on Brittany's phone. To make the problem more reasonable, let's assume that Brittany's phone can hold 10% of the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold. In that case, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph would be:

1800 photographs for Jamal's phone
-----------------------------------
10% of 1800 photographs for Brittany's phone

Number of ducks = 180 photographs

115," To calculate the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we first need to find the total cost she paid for all the boards she's selling.

For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the total cost is:
10 boards * $10/board = $100

For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the total cost is:
5 boards * $16/board = $80

The total cost Sasha paid for all the boards is $180.

To find the profit, we need to know the selling price for each board. Let's assume that Sasha sells each 2 x 4 x 10 board for $15 and each 4 x 4 x 10 board for $25.

The total revenue she gets from selling all the boards is:
Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15/board = $150
Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $25/board = $125

The total revenue Sasha gets from selling all the boards is $275.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = $275 (total revenue) - $180 (total cost) = $95

So, Sasha makes a profit of $95 from selling her leftover lumber.

116," To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we first need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar correspond to 13 cups of water in the given ratio.

We know that the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Since 1 cup of water is equal to 16 teaspoons, we can find the number of teaspoons in 13 cups by multiplying the number of cups by the number of teaspoons in one cup and then multiplying that by 13.

13 cups * 16 teaspoons/cup = 208 teaspoons

Now, we know that the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 208 times the number of teaspoons of sugar that correspond to 1 cup of water. Since 1 cup of water was used for every 13 cups of water, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 208 by 1/13.

208 teaspoons * 1/13 = approximately 157.73 teaspoons

119," To find the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we first need to determine their individual salaries based on their percentage increases from their past salaries.

1. Adrien's salary increase: His salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, and he now earns 40% more than his salary four years ago. Let's call Lylah's salary X.
   Adrien's salary (four years ago) = X
   Adrien's salary (current) = 1.3 * X (30% higher than Lylah's)
   Adrien's salary (four years later) = 1.4 * Adrien's salary (four years ago) = 1.4 * 1.3 * X

2. Lylah's salary increase: Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, and they both had the same percentage increase in their salaries over the next four years, Lylah's salary four years later would be:
   Lylah's salary (four years later) = 1.3 * X

Now we can find the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary of Adrien = Adrien's salary (four years later) = 1.4 * 1.3 * X
Total salary of Lylah = Lylah's salary (four years later) = 1.3 * X

Given that Adrien's salary was $40000 four years ago, we can find the value of X:

X = $40000

Now we can calculate the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary of Adrien = 1.4 * 1.3 * $40000 = $73200
Total salary of Lylah = 1.3 * $40000 = $52800

1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Let's call the cost of one pepper p. Then, the cost of one watermelon is 3p.
2. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, the cost of one orange is 3p - 5.

Now, let's calculate how much Dillon will spend on each type of item:

1. Watermelons: He buys 4 watermelons, so the total cost is 4 * 3p = 12p.
2. Peppers: He buys 20 peppers, and each pepper costs $15, so the total cost is 20 * $15 = $300.
3. Oranges: He buys 10 oranges, so the total cost is 10 * (3p - 5) = 10 * (3p - 5).

129," To calculate the profit made by the hospital from these visits, we first need to find out how many hours the doctors work per day and how much revenue the hospital generates from the patients.

1. First, let's find out how many hours the doctors work per day. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, there are 60 minutes in an hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of patients seen per hour: 60 minutes / 24 minutes = 2.5 patients per hour.
2. Next, we can find out how many hours the doctors work per day by dividing the total number of patients seen per day by the number of patients seen per hour: 500 patients / 2.5 patients per hour = 200 hours per day.
3. Now, let's calculate the revenue generated from the patients. Since the hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients, the daily revenue from patient visits is: 200 hours per day * $200 per hour = $40,000 per day.
4. The doctors are paid $150 an hour by the hospital. So, the cost of paying the doctors is: 200 hours per day * $150 per hour = $30,000 per day.
5. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of paying the doctors from the revenue generated from the patients: $40,000 per day - $30,000 per day = $10,000 per day.

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5

However, we know that Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. So, the actual number of video games Brian has is x - 5.

We can now substitute this value into the equation for Bobby's number of video games:

Bobby's video games = 3 * (x - 5) - 5

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, let's get rid of the constant term on the right side:

Bobby's video games = 3x - 15

Now, we need to isolate x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

(Bobby's video games) / 3 = x - 1/3

Since we're looking for an integer value for x, we need to find a value that results in an integer value for Bobby's video games when we multiply it by 3 and subtract 15.

Let's try x = 12:

Bobby's video games = 3 * 12 - 15

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Then, the number of baby bees is 2Q, and the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. So, we can write the equation:

Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700

Combining the terms with Q, we get:

Now, we can find Q by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

Q = 116.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a queen, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 117 queens.

Now, we can find the number of baby bees:

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $13

Now, we need to find the cost of the nonfood items (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) and calculate the tax on each of them. Then, we add up the cost of the nonfood items and the tax to find the total cost with tax.

Cost of nonfood items = Cost of light bulbs + Cost of cups + Cost of roach traps = $3 + $3 + $4 = $9

Tax on nonfood items = 10% of $9 = 0.1 * $9 = $0.9

Total cost with tax = Total cost before tax + Tax on nonfood items = $13 + $0.9 = $13.9

So, the total cost of everything with the 10% tax on nonfood items is \boxed{$13.9}.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
144," To calculate the profit for Kim's housekeeping business each week, we first need to find out his total expenses and then subtract that from his total income.

Let's find out the number of clients he has in total and the number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths he will need for all of them.

Kim has 3 current clients, so he has used 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 bottles of bleach and 3 packs of cloths for them.
He is talking to 5 potential clients, so if he gets them as clients, he will need an additional 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 bottles of bleach and 5 packs of cloths for them.

So in total, Kim will need 6 + 10 = <<6+10=16>>16 bottles of bleach and 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 packs of cloths.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach will be 16 * $2 = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths will be 8 * $5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.

So the total expenses for Kim each week will be $32 + $40 = $<<32+40=72>>72.

Now we can find out the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:

The profit each week for Kim's housekeeping business is $92 - $72 = $<<92-72=20>>20.

The final answer is: Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

157," To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the distance each person ran during the contest.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, his total distance is:

15 * 100 = 1500 yards

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. So, her total distance is:

34 * 80 (since she runs half the length of the field each time) = 2720 feet

To convert Kelly's distance from feet to yards, we use the conversion factor: 1 yard = 3 feet. So,

2720 feet = 2720 / 3 = 906.67 yards

Now, we can find the difference between the distances they ran:

Difference = Blake's distance - Kelly's distance
Difference = 1500 yards - 906.67 yards

First, let's find the cost of the red cars. We know that there are 5 red cars, and one red car costs $4. So, the cost of all red cars is:

$$5 \times \$4$$

Now, let's find the cost of the action figures. We know that there are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. So, the cost of all action figures is:

$$3 \times \$5$$

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car. Since one red car costs $4 and three action figures cost $5 each, we know that the cost of 3 action figures is $15. So, the cost of the doll is:

$$\$15 + \$4$$

Therefore, the total cost of all toys is:

$$5 \times \$4 + 3 \times \$5 + (\$15 + \$4)$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Since it takes him 1 minute and 15 seconds (95 seconds) to peel a potato, and only 5 seconds to cut it up, the total time for peeling and cutting one potato is 95 seconds.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Billy to prep all 60 potatoes. To do this, we multiply the time it takes to prep one potato by the number of potatoes:

Total time = Time per potato * Number of potatoes
Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes

Calculating this, we get:

Total time = 5700 seconds

To make this time more understandable, we can convert it to minutes and hours. We know that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, we can divide the total number of seconds by 60 to find the number of minutes, and then divide the number of minutes by 60 to find the number of hours:

175," To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to determine their total revenue and cost for making the lemonade.

Let's denote the number of gallons they sold as x. Their total revenue would be:

Total revenue = Price per glass * Number of glasses per gallon * Number of gallons sold
Total revenue = $0.50 * 20 * x

Their total cost for making the lemonade consists of the cost for lemons and the cost for sugar. Let's denote the cost for lemons per gallon as c. Then, their total cost would be:

Total cost = Cost for lemons per gallon * Number of gallons + Cost for sugar per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cost = c * x + $2 * x

Since they made a profit of $25, we can find their total cost by subtracting their total revenue from their total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
Total cost = ($0.50 * 20 * x) - $25

Now, we want to find the cost for lemons (c) that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can first simplify the equation:

Total cost = $10 * x - $25

To find the value of c, we need to isolate x:

$10x = $30
x = 3

So, they sold 3 gallons of lemonade. Now, we can find the cost for lemons per gallon (c) by plugging this value back into the total cost equation:

Total cost = c * 3 + $2 * 3
Total cost = 3c + $6

We know their total cost was $15 (Total revenue = $37.5, Total cost = $22.5), so we can set up the equation:

3c + $6 = $15
3c = $9
c = $3

Therefore, they spent $3 on lemons for each gallon they made.

### Final result: Juan and Carlos spent $9 on lemons for making 3 gallons of lemonade.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}

Total racers - Japanese team members = Chinese team members
240 - 80 = 160

Now, we know that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese team members:

177," To find out how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we first need to calculate how much he spends on rent, car fuel, charity, his daughter, and his wife.

1. Rent: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. So, the amount spent on rent is (1/4) * $6000 = $1500.
2. Car fuel: Zaid spends 1/3 of his remaining salary on car fuel. Let's denote the amount he has left after rent as X. So, the amount spent on car fuel is (1/3) * X.
3. Charity: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity. So, the amount donated is 1/2 * X.
4. Daughter's expenses: Zaid gives his daughter $200 per week, so the total amount given to her in a month is $200 * 4 = $800.
5. Wife's expenses: Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household goods.

Now, let's find out how much money Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations. We know that his total expenses are rent + car fuel + charity + daughter's expenses + wife's expenses. So, we have the following equation:

$6000 = $1500 + (1/3) * X + (1/2) * X + $800 + $700

To solve for X, we first need to get all the terms with X on the same side of the equation:

$6000 = $1500 + $X + $X/3 + $X/2 + $800 + $700

Next, we combine the terms with X:

$6000 = $1500 + $X*(1 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1) + $800 + $700

Now, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

$6000 = $1500 + $X*(1 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1 + 1/3)

$6000 = $1500 + $X*(5/6 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/3)

$6000 = $1500 + $X*(7/6 + 2 + 1/3)

$6000 = $1500 + $X*(22/6)

To find X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by (22/6):

$6000 / (22/6) = $1500 * (6/22) + X

$2727.27 = $750 + X

Now, we subtract $750 from both sides to find X:

$1977.27 = X

So, Zaid will have $1977.27 left after all his expenses and donations.

The total number of crabs the three have together is the sum of the number of crabs Bo, Monic, and Rani have:

Total number of crabs = Number of crabs Bo has + Number of crabs Monic has + Number of crabs Rani has

181," To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business, we first need to determine the number of red roses Sandra originally ordered. We know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of red roses is 4x, and the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. The total number of flowers Sandra ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies.

Total number of flowers = Red roses + White carnations + Pink calla lilies
Total number of flowers = 4x + x + 5x

Combining like terms, we get:

Total number of flowers = 10x

Since we don't have information about the total number of flowers Sandra ordered, we cannot determine the exact number of red roses Fred needs to deliver. However, we know that Sandra is unhappy with the incomplete order delivery, so it's safe to assume that some of the red roses are missing. To keep Sandra's business, Fred should deliver all the missing red roses by 5 pm.

182," Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jan's current age divided by 2.
3. Jan's current age is 30.

Let's denote Mark's age as M and Jean's age as J. From the problem statement, we have:

J = M + 2

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's current age. So, we have:

M - 2 = Jan's age (two years ago) + 5

Jan's age (two years ago) = M - 2 - 5

Jan's age (two years ago) = M - 7

Now, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's current age. So, we can write:

(M - 7)/2 = M - 5

Solving for M, we get:

M = 10 + 2*(1 + 5/2)

M = 10 + 2*(1 + 2.5)

M = 10 + 2*(3.5)

M = 10 + 7

M = 17

Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding the given difference:

J = M + 2

J = 17 + 2

J = 19

183," To find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the total time it takes each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the well-rounded team, since all members run in 55 seconds, the total time for the team is:
Total time for well-rounded team = 4 * 55 = \boxed{220 \text{ seconds}}

For the less well-rounded team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner takes 3 seconds less than the previous runner. So, the times for each runner are:

Runner 1: 60 seconds
Runner 2: 57 seconds
Runner 3: 54 seconds
Runner 4: 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
Total time for less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = \boxed{222 \text{ seconds}}

Therefore, the difference in time between the two teams is:
Difference in time = Total time for less well-rounded team - Total time for well-rounded team
Difference in time = 222 - 220 = \boxed{2 \text{ seconds}}

So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds.

184," To find the answer, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row for Jerry.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 in a single roll:

There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) on a six-sided die. So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling an odd number is also 1/2. Since we want the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we can find it by subtracting the probability of rolling an even number:

P(number > 3) = 1 - P(even number) = 1 - (1/2) = 1/2

Now, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

The probability of rolling an even number in the first roll is 1/2. Since we've already rolled an even number, the probability of rolling an even number in the second roll is also 1/2. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

P(two even numbers) = P(even number in the first roll) * P(even number in the second roll) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4

To find the difference in their probabilities as a percentage, we can subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and then divide the result by the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

Percentage difference = [P(number > 3) - P(two even numbers)] / P(number > 3) * 100%

Percentage difference = [(1/2) - (1/4)] / (1/2) * 100%

Percentage difference = [1/4 - 1/2] / 1/2 * 100%

Percentage difference = [1/4 - 1/2] * 2 * 100%

Percentage difference = [-1/4] * 2 * 100%

Percentage difference = -50%

However, since we cannot have a negative percentage, we need to take the absolute value:

186," To find the number of rats in each cage for the group of cages with rats, we first need to determine the total number of rats in these cages. We know that there are 3 cages, each with an equal number of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. So, the total number of rats is:

Total number of rats = Total number of pieces of straw for rats / Pieces of straw per rat

Total number of pieces of straw for rats = Number of cages for rats * Number of rats per cage * Pieces of straw per rat

Total number of pieces of straw for rats = 3 * (?) * 6

We know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160. So, we can set up the equation:

3 * (?) * 6 = 160

To solve for the number of rats in each cage, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3 and 6:

(?) = 160 / (3 * 6)

(?) = 160 / 18

(?) = 8.89 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we need to round up or down to the nearest whole number. In this case, rounding down would result in an incorrect total number of pieces of straw distributed. So, we round up:

188," To find out how many bags the trader sold, we first need to determine the number of bags he bought from the farmer. We know that each bag costs $20 to buy and that the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

To calculate the number of bags bought, we can subtract the total cost of the bags (including transportation) from the total revenue (selling price) and divide by the profit per bag:

Total cost = Cost per bag (purchased) * Number of bags + Transportation cost per bag * Number of bags
Total revenue = Selling price per bag * Number of bags

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

Let x be the number of bags.

$400 = ($30 * x) - ($20 * x - $2 * x)

Simplifying the equation:

$400 = $30x - ($22x)
$400 = $8x
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader bought 50 bags of wheat from the farmer. Since we know the selling price per bag and the profit per bag, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $400 / ($30 - $20)
Number of bags sold = $400 / $10

To find the cost each friend paid for all the expenses, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and divide by the number of friends:

Total cost = $6.75 * 3 (tickets) + $24.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $101.30

199," Let x be the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A each week, and y be the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B each week. Since the total number of sentences Mark edits each week is 1000, we have:

x + y = 1000

The payment Mark receives from Publisher A for editing one sentence is 5 cents, so the payment he receives from Publisher B for editing one sentence is 5 cents * 2 = 10 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from both publishers in a week is the sum of the payments he receives from each publisher:

Total payment = 5c/sentence * x sentences (Publisher A) + 10c/sentence * y sentences (Publisher B)

Since x + y = 1000, we can express y in terms of x:

y = 1000 - x

Substituting y into the equation for total payment, we get:

Total payment = 5c/sentence * x + 10c/sentence * (1000 - x)

To simplify this expression, we can distribute the 10c/sentence term over the entire expression:

Total payment = 5c/sentence * x + 10c/sentence * 1000 - 10c/sentence * x

Combining like terms, we get:

Total payment = 5c/sentence * x + 10c/sentence * 1000 - 10c/sentence * x
Total payment = 5c/sentence * x + 10c/sentence * 1000 - x * 10c/sentence
Total payment = 5c/sentence * x + 10000c/sentence - x * 10c/sentence

To find the value of x that maximizes the total payment, we can set the derivative of the total payment equation with respect to x equal to zero and solve for x:

d(Total payment)/dx = 5c/sentence - 10c/sentence
d(Total payment)/dx = -5c/sentence

Since the derivative is negative, the maximum total payment occurs when x is as small as possible. In other words, Mark should edit as many sentences as possible for Publisher A, which pays less per sentence.

To find the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A and the corresponding total payment, we can set x = 0 and solve for y:

y = 1000 - x
y = 1000

Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A, the total payment he receives from both publishers in a week is:

Total payment = 5c/sentence * x + 10c/sentence * y

Money John made in a year before the award = Weekly salary * Number of weeks
= $2,000 * 52
= $104,000

Now, let's calculate John's new annual salary after receiving the 5% raise:

New annual salary = Old annual salary + Monetary reward + (Old annual salary * 5%)
= $104,000 + $5,000 + ($104,000 * 0.05)

203," To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, we need to calculate the number of slices he used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese separately, and then add them up.

First, let's find out how many slices of cheese Carl used for sandwiches:
- He ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, so he had 7 sandwiches in a week.
- He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, so the total number of slices for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = \boxed{14}.

Next, let's find out how many slices of cheese Carl used for omelets:
- He used cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
- He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 3 * (2 + 1) = 3 * 3 = \boxed{9} slices for omelets.

Finally, let's find out how many slices of cheese Carl used for macaroni and cheese:
- He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Now, let's add up the number of slices of cheese Carl used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:
- Total number of slices of cheese = 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = \boxed{31}.

205," To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate her current average without removing the lowest score.

Current average = (Total points earned / Number of tests taken)
Total points earned = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 348
Number of tests taken = 5

Current average = 348 / 5 = 69.6

Since Mr. Bert allows students to remove the lowest score, Brinley's actual average is calculated by excluding the lowest score (71) and dividing the total points earned by the number of tests taken (excluding the lowest score):

Average without lowest score = Total points earned / (Number of tests taken - 1)
Average without lowest score = 348 / 4 = 87

Brinley wants her average to be 93. To find the difference between her desired average and her current average without the lowest score, we subtract her current average from her desired average:

Difference = Desired average - Current average
Difference = 93 - 87 = 6

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs to earn on the sixth test to make up for the 6-point difference:

Score needed = Desired average * Number of tests taken - Total points earned (excluding lowest score)
Score needed = 93 * 6 - 348 = 150

So, Brinley needs to score a 150 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

207," To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then add their weights together.

Let's denote the weight of one candied apple as x. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of one chocolate bar is 2x.

We know that Joe has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. So, the total weight of chocolate bars is 25 * 2x = 50x, and the total weight of candied apples is 80 * x.

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weights of chocolate bars and candied apples: 50x + 80x = 130x.

We also know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. So, we can set up an equation to find the weight of one candied apple: 40g = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 20g.

Substituting x = 20g into the equation for the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we get:

Total weight = 50x + 80x = 130x = 130 * 20g = 2600g

Finally, we'll divide the cost difference by the number of cups in twenty dozens to find the cost per cup.

1. Number of cups in twenty dozens: 20 * 12 = 240 cups
2. Cost of twenty dozens of cups: $1200 less than $6000 for half a dozen plates, so the cost of twenty dozens of cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800

210," To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and two pairs of shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + ($20 x 2) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. So, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes is $70 / $4. However, we also need to consider the $10 Sara already had saved before she started earning money. So, the final calculation is ($70 - $10) / $4.

The final answer is Sara needs to mow the lawn 16.25 times to afford the jacket and shoes. Since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she'll need to mow the lawn 17 times to have enough money.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

3. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's set up two equations based on the given information:

1. R + W = total number of chickens
2. 3R + 5W = 42 (the number of eggs collected daily)

We also know that there are two more white chickens than red chickens, so W = R + 2.

Now, we can substitute W with R + 2 in the second equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Solving for R:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

213," On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 150 customers on the second day (100 + 50). To find the number of customers she counted on the third day, we need to find the number of customers she counted on the third day minus the number of customers she counted on the first two days. We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500, so:

500 = 100 (day 1) + x (day 3)

To find x (the number of customers she counted on the third day), we need to subtract the number of customers she counted on the first day from the total number of customers:

214," Let's denote the volume of the small pool as x. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had half the volume of the big pool, so the volume of the big pool was 2x. The big pool is now emptying at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so the time it took to fill up with water that the small pool currently has was the amount of water in the small pool divided by the leak rate:  x / 4 gallons/minute = t minutes.

Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation: 2x = 4x + V, where V is the volume of water that the small pool currently has. Solving for V, we get: V = (2x - 4x) = -2x. However, since the volume of water cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculation. Let's try to find the correct solution.

Let's denote the volume of the big pool as y. We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so y = 2x. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so y = 4x.

The difference in the volume of water between the big pool and the small pool from 4 minutes ago to the present is the amount of water that leaked out of the big pool during that time. Since the leak rate is 4 gallons/minute, the volume of water that leaked out of the big pool during the time it took for the small pool to fill up is 4x.

Therefore, the volume of water that the small pool had 4 minutes ago was x, and the volume of water that it has now is x + 4x = 5x. We know that the volume of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2x, so the volume of water that the big pool has now is 2x + 4x = 6x.

Since the total volume of water in the big pool and the small pool 4 minutes ago was 3x (2x for the big pool and x for the small pool), and the total volume of water in the big pool and the small pool now is 11x (6x for the big pool and 5x for the small pool), the difference in the total volume of water between 4 minutes ago and the present is 8x.

However, since the leak rate is 4 gallons/minute, the total volume of water that leaked out of the big pool during that time is 8x * 4 gallons/minute = 32x gallons. Since the small pool currently has 5x gallons, the big pool must have had 32x + 5x = 37x gallons 4 minutes ago.

Since the volume of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2x, we can write the equation: 2x = 37x. Solving for x, we get x = 19 gallons.

216," To find the remaining balance after Janeth makes all her monthly payments, we first need to determine the total amount she will pay over the course of the 12-month period. We know that she pays $165 each month, so we can calculate the total payment as follows:

Total payment = Monthly payment × Number of months
Total payment = $165 × 12
Total payment = $1980

Now, we need to find out how much of this total payment goes towards paying off the original $2000 loan and how much goes towards the additional 10% that Janeth agreed to pay. Let's call the original loan amount ""principal"" and the additional amount ""interest.""

We know that the total payment is equal to the sum of the principal and the interest:

Total payment = Principal + Interest
$1980 = $2000 + Interest

To find the interest, we can subtract the principal from the total payment:

Interest = Total payment - Principal
Interest = $1980 - $2000
Interest = -$20

Wait a minute! A negative interest value doesn't make sense. This means that our initial calculation of the total payment was incorrect. Let's try to find the principal instead:

Principal = Total payment - Interest
Principal = $1980 + $20
Principal = $2000

So, it turns out that Janeth has already paid off the entire $2000 loan by the end of the 12-month period. Therefore, her remaining balance is zero.

1. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age: A = 3H
2. Harriet's age is half of Zack's age: H = Z/2

Now we have to find their ages in three years and then calculate the average. First, let's find Adrian's age:

A = 3H
A = 3 * (Z/2)
A = 3Z/2

In three years, Harriet's age will be H + 3, and Zack's age will be Z + 3. So, we can find Harriet's age in three years:

H + 3 = (Z + 3)/2

Now, we can solve for Z:

(Z + 3)/2 = H + 3
Z + 3 = 2(H + 3)
Z + 3 = 2H + 6
Z = 2H + 3

Now we have Z, so we can find Adrian's age in three years:

A = 3Z/2
A = 3 * (2H + 3)/2
A = 3(H + 1)

Now we have the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years. Let's calculate the average:

Average age = (Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age) / 3
Average age = ((3(H + 1)) + (H + 3) + (2H + 3)) / 3

Now, we can substitute H = 21:

Average age = ((3(21 + 1)) + (21 + 3) + (21 + 3)) / 3
Average age = ((3 * 22) + 25 + 25) / 3

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:

Water type cards = 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) + 0 (gained) = 32

Now, we can calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card by finding the ratio of water type cards to the total number of cards and multiplying by 100:

Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100%

Percentage chance = (32 / 90) * 100%

Now, to find out how many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we'll subtract the number of harvested melons from the total number of melons:

Melons not harvested after 4 months = Total melons - Harvested melons
= 120 - (36 + 62)
= 120 - 100
= 20 melons

So, there were 20 watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

Cost of each car = $20,000
Cost of all cars = Cost of each car * Number of cars
Cost of all cars = $20,000 * 12
Cost of all cars = $240,000

Next, let's calculate the tax amount:

Tax rate = 10%
Tax amount = Cost of all cars * Tax rate
Tax amount = $240,000 * 0.1
Tax amount = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each car, including tax and registration:

Registration fee = $1,000
Total cost of each car = Cost of each car + Tax amount + Registration fee
Total cost of each car = $20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000
Total cost of each car = $23,000

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all the cars:

Total cost of all cars = Cost of each car * Number of cars

First, let's calculate how many penguins went swimming:

Number of penguins swimming = Total number of penguins * (1/3)
Number of penguins swimming = 36 * (1/3)
Number of penguins swimming = 12

Next, let's calculate how many penguins went to eat:

Number of penguins eating = Total number of penguins * (1/3)
Number of penguins eating = 36 * (1/3)
Number of penguins eating = 12

Now, we can find out how many penguins are still sunbathing:

Number of penguins sunbathing = Total number of penguins - Number of penguins swimming - Number of penguins eating

234," To find out how many tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend consume in total per week, we first need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per day and then multiply that by 7 to get the weekly consumption. We know that Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend. Therefore, his girlfriend eats 6 tomatoes per day as well.

The weekly consumption for Steve:
Tomatoes eaten by Steve per week = Tomatoes eaten per day * 7 days
= 6 tomatoes * 7 days
= 42 tomatoes

Since his girlfriend eats the same amount, the total weekly consumption for both of them is:
Total weekly consumption = Consumption for Steve + Consumption for girlfriend
= 42 tomatoes + 42 tomatoes
= 84 tomatoes

Now, we need to find out how many vines are required to produce 84 tomatoes per week. We know that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

Number of vines required = Total weekly consumption / Tomatoes produced per vine

Total slices required = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80 slices

Since each pizza provides 8 slices, we can now calculate how many pizzas John needs to order:

Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a pizza, John will need to order 11 pizzas to ensure that all his friends get their 4 slices each.

1. Mike writes to 5 pen pals. He stopped writing to 2 of them, so he writes to 3 of them now.
2. Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike responds in kind, so he writes 5 pages for each letter.
3. Therefore, Mike writes a total of 5 pages × 3 pen pals = <<5*3=15>>15 pages a week.
4. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so it takes him 6 minutes × 1 page = <<6*1=6>>6 minutes to write one page.
5. To find out how long it takes him to write 15 pages, we need to multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page: 15 pages × 6 minutes/page = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes.
6. To convert minutes to hours, we divide the number of minutes by 60: 90 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = <<90/60=1.5>>1.5 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost of one session:
Cost of one session = Charges per hour * Hours per session
Cost of one session = \$250/hour * 6 hours
Cost of one session = \$1500

Next, let's calculate the total number of sessions:
Number of sessions = Number of sessions per week * Number of weeks
Number of sessions = 4 sessions/week * 5 weeks
Number of sessions = 20 sessions

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Jean paid:

Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 * 50
Total weight = 200 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought. Since 1 pound of onions costs $1.50, we can calculate the number of pounds by dividing the total cost by the price per pound:

Number of pounds = Total cost / Price per pound
Number of pounds = (Cost for 200 pounds) / $1.50/pound

To find the total cost for 200 pounds, we first need to calculate the cost for one pound and then multiply it by 200:

Cost for 1 pound = $1.50
Cost for 200 pounds = Cost for 1 pound * 200
Cost for 200 pounds = $1.50 * 200
Cost for 200 pounds = $300

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 13 * 2 = <<13*2=26>>26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total calories Sue consumed and the total calories her sister consumed.

Total calories Sue consumed = (Calories in cookies on Monday) + (Calories in cookies on Tuesday)
Total calories Sue consumed = (20 cookies * 200 calories/cookie) + (26 cookies * 200 calories/cookie)
Total calories Sue consumed = 4000 calories + 5200 calories = <<4000+5200=9200>>9200 calories

Total calories her sister consumed = (Calories in cookies on Monday) + (Calories in cookies on Tuesday)
Total calories her sister consumed = (5 cookies * 200 calories/cookie) + (13 cookies * 200 calories/cookie)
Total calories her sister consumed = 1000 calories + 2600 calories = <<1000+2600=3600>>3600 calories

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the total calories her sister consumed from the total calories Sue consumed.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed today as x and the number of cougars killed today as y.

From the information given, we know that:

1. Last night: wolves = 10, cougars = 15
2. Today: wolves = 3x, cougars = y

We also know that:

1. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: x = 3y
2. Three fewer cougars were killed today than the previous night: y = 12 (since there were 15 cougars killed the previous night)

Now we can substitute y = 12 into the equation x = 3y:

x = 3 * 12
x = 36

So, Rick killed 36 wolves today. To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of wolves and cougars killed last night to the number of wolves and cougars killed today:

Total animals killed = 10 (wolves last night) + 15 (cougars last night) + 36 (wolves today) + y (cougars today)

267," To find the total time it takes to heat up the oil and cook the chicken, we need to find the time it takes for each step and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 300 degrees, which is given as 20 minutes.

Next, we need to find the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. We know that it takes 40% longer than the time it took to heat up to 300 degrees, so:

Time to heat up to 400 degrees = Time to heat up to 300 degrees * 1.4
Time to heat up to 400 degrees = 20 minutes * 1.4
Time to heat up to 400 degrees = 28 minutes

Now, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat up the oil. So, the time it takes to cook the chicken is:

Time to cook = Time to heat up to 400 degrees - 5 minutes
Time to cook = 28 minutes - 5 minutes
Time to cook = 23 minutes

Finally, we can find the total time by adding the time it took to heat up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken:

Total time = Time to heat up to 300 degrees + Time to cook
Total time = 20 minutes + 23 minutes

273," To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to determine the number of stitches in each part of the sweater: the body, the collar, and the rosette. We know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that number, and the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.

Let's calculate the number of stitches in the collar:
Collar stitches = Body stitches * 1/10
Collar stitches = 900 * 1/10
Collar stitches = 90

Now, let's calculate the number of stitches in the rosette:
Rosette stitches = Collar stitches * 2
Rosette stitches = 90 * 2
Rosette stitches = 180

Since we know that the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, we can find the number of stitches in each sleeve by subtracting the number of stitches in the body, the collar, and the rosette from the total number of stitches:

Total stitches = Body stitches + Collar stitches + Rosette stitches + (2 * Sleeve stitches)
1800 = 900 + 90 + 180 + (2 * Sleeve stitches)

Solving for Sleeve stitches:
Sleeve stitches = (1800 - 900 - 90 - 180) / 2
Sleeve stitches = (900) / 2
Sleeve stitches = 450

275," To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and then add his solo song lines.

First, let's find the number of lines for the first scene:
1.5 times the number of lines in the second scene = 1.5 * (Lines in the second scene + 6)

Since four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, we can find the total number of lines in the second scene by dividing the number of lines Sean has by four-fifths and then multiplying by five:

Lines in the second scene = (Lines Sean has) / (4/5)

Now, we can calculate the number of lines for the first scene:

Lines in the first scene = 1.5 * (Lines in the second scene + 6)
Lines in the first scene = 1.5 * ([Lines Sean has] / (4/5) + 6)

Next, we'll find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize by adding the lines for both scenes and his solo song:

Total lines = Lines in the first scene + Lines in the solo song
Total lines = 1.5 * ([Lines Sean has] / (4/5) + 6) + Lines in the solo song

We know that the solo song has 54 lines, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

Total lines = 1.5 * ([Lines Sean has] / (4/5) + 6) + 54

To find the number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to solve for [Lines Sean has]. Unfortunately, this equation cannot be solved directly, as it is a quadratic equation with no simple solution. However, we can use trial and error or a calculator to find an approximate value.

For example, if we assume Sean has 100 lines to memorize, we can calculate the corresponding values for the lines in the first and second scenes:

Lines in the first scene = 1.5 * (100 / (4/5) + 6) = 150.9167
Lines in the second scene = (100) / (4/5) = 133.3333

Since the number of lines cannot be a fraction, this approximation is not valid. We need to try another value for [Lines Sean has]. By repeating this process, we can find that Sean needs to memorize approximately 168 lines to meet the given conditions.

Result: Sean has to memorize approximately 168 lines.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

Let's calculate the time it takes to dig 30 small holes:
Time for 30 small holes = Number of small holes * Time per small hole
Time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3
Time for 30 small holes = 90 minutes

Now let's calculate the time it takes to dig 15 large holes:
Time for 15 large holes = Number of large holes * Time per large hole
Time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10
Time for 15 large holes = 150 minutes

To find the total time in hours, we need to convert the minutes to hours:
Total time = (90 minutes + 150 minutes) / 60 minutes per hour
Total time = (240 minutes) / 60 minutes per hour
Total time = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

278," To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine each person's age based on the given information that their current sum is 20. Since we don't have enough information to determine how old each person is, we can only find possible combinations of their ages that add up to 20.

Let's assume that Mico is older than Marco. In this case, Mico's age could be any number greater than Marco's age, as long as their sum is 20. For example, if Marco is 10 years old, then Mico could be 11, 12, 13, or any older age.

To find their ages in 10 years, we would add 10 years to each person's current age. So, if Marco is currently 10 years old, then in 10 years, he will be 20 years old. And if Mico is currently 11 years old, then in 10 years, he will be 21 years old.

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will depend on their current ages. Without knowing their exact ages, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, we can say that their ages will be at least 20 and 20 (or more) in 10 years.

279," Let's denote Sam's current age as S. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's age is 6S. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, which can be written as 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9). Solving for S, we get:

S = (3(S + 9) - 9) / 3
S = (3S + 27 - 9) / 3
S = (3S + 18) / 3

To find the value of S, we need to divide 3S + 18 by 3:

S = (3S + 18) / 3
S = S + 18/3
S = S + 6
S = S + 6

Now we have S = S + 12. To find the value of S, we need to subtract 12 from both sides:

S = S - 12
S = S + (-12)
S = S - 12

So, Sam is currently 6 - 12 = -6 years older than Ruby. Since a negative age doesn't make sense, we made an error in our initial assumption. Ruby must be younger than Sam. To find Sam's age, we can set up the equation:

Ruby's age = 6 * Sam's age
Let R = Ruby's age and S = Sam's age

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Substituting R = 6S, we get:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Solving for S:

S = (6S + 9 - 3(S + 9)) / (3 - 1)
S = (6S + 9 - 3S - 27) / 2
S = (3S - 18) / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2:

2S = 3S - 18
S = S - 18
S = S - 18

Now we have S = S - 36. To find the value of S, we need to subtract 36 from both sides:

S = S - 36
S = S + (-36)
S = S - 36

So, Sam's current age is S = 36.

The length of one topaz gemstone is given as one inch. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones in a necklace, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:

Total length of topaz gemstones = Number of gemstones * Length of one gemstone
Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 * 1 inch
Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 inches

The total length of the necklace is given as 25 inches. Since the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches, the length of the sterling silver beads must be:

Length of sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches
Length of sterling silver beads = 17 inches

Now, we need to find out how many sterling silver beads are needed to make up this length. Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can calculate the number of beads as follows:

289," To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane, we first need to determine how far the car in the slow lane travels in the same amount of time.

The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour, and it covers a total distance of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel this distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time for the fast lane car = 480 miles / 60 miles per hour = 8 hours

Now, we know that the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 30 miles per hour. We can now calculate the distance the slow lane car covers in 8 hours using the same formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance for the slow lane car = 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Since both cars traveled the same distance (480 miles), we can now set up an equation to find the time it took for the slow lane car to cover that distance:

292," During the 3-hour period between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., there are a total of 180 minutes (3 hours * 60 minutes). Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, so the number of earnings she gets during this time is 180 minutes / 10 minutes = 18 earnings.

However, Susan takes a half-hour break, which is 30 minutes. Since she doesn't earn any money during her break, we need to subtract the time spent on the break from the total working time. So, the actual time Susan spends working is 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Therefore, Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work, so her total earnings for the 150 minutes of work is $5/minute * 150 minutes = $750.

On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. So, he does: 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups, 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

The total number of activities he does on the second day is: 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 activities.

To find the total number of activities he does in the two days, we add the number of activities he does on each day: 170 activities (first day) + 200 activities (second day) = 370 activities.

First, let's find out how much rice is consumed daily:
Rice consumed daily = Rice per meal per person * Number of meals per day * Number of people

Rice consumed daily = 0.2 kg * 2 * 5 = 5 kg

Now, we can find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Weeks = Total rice in the bag / Rice consumed daily

Weeks = 42 kg / 5 kg/week

Result: \boxed{8.4} \approx 9 weeks. Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, meaning the rice will last for 10 weeks.

Crates sold on Tuesday: 15
Crates sold on Wednesday: 12
Crates sold on Thursday: 18

Total crates sold during the week (excluding weekend): 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates

Now, let's calculate how many crates Sam was supposed to sell each day during the week, assuming he sells crates every day:

Total crates to sell in a week: 120
Number of days in a week: 7

Crates to sell per day: 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since Sam can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll round up the number of crates he should have sold per day to 18 crates.

Total crates Sam should have sold during the week: 18 crates/day * 5 days = 90 crates

Finally, we can calculate the difference between Sam's target and the actual number of crates he sold:

Difference in crates: 120 (target) - 45 (actual) = 75 crates

298," Let's denote the number of bids Carmen makes as n. Since she bids after each of the 3 other people, there are 4 bids made in total every time the price increases by $50. Therefore, n represents the number of price increases, not the number of bids Carmen made in total.

The price of the desk increases by $50 each time, so the cost of the desk for Carmen is given by the formula:

Cost = Initial bid + (n-1) * Increase

We know that the initial bid is $200 and that Carmen wins the auction, so we need to find the value of n such that the cost equals the winning bid.

Let's set up the equation:

$200 + (n-1) * $50 = Cost

We don't know the value of Cost, but we can express it in terms of n:

Cost = $200 + (n-1) * $50

To find the value of n, we need to solve for it:

$200 + (n-1) * $50 = $200 + $50n

Subtracting $200 from both sides:

$50(n-1) = $50n - $200

Subtracting $50n from both sides:

$-$50 = $50(1 - n)

Dividing both sides by 50:

$-$1 = 1 - n

Adding 1 to both sides:

n = 2

So, Carmen makes 2 bids in total, and the cost of the desk is:

Result: \$450

Therefore, the antique desk costs Carmen $450.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}
299," To calculate the annual cost of John's driving service, we need to find the cost of the miles driven each way and the monthly bonus paid to the driver.

First, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven each way:
Cost per mile = $2
Round trip miles = 2 * 30 miles = 60 miles

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the miles driven per day:
Cost per day = Cost per mile * Round trip miles
Cost per day = $2 * 60 miles = $120

Now, we'll calculate the cost of the miles driven per week:
Cost per week = Cost per day * Days per week
Cost per week = $120 * 5 days = $600

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the miles driven per year:
Cost per year = Cost per week * Weeks per year
Cost per year = $600 * 50 weeks = $30,000

Finally, we'll add the monthly bonus to the annual cost:
Bonus per month = $150
Annual bonus = Bonus per month * 12 months
Annual bonus = $150 * 12 = $1,800

The final answer is: $31,800. John pays $31,800 per year for his driving service.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

Total time on Monday and Sunday = 16 minutes + 23 minutes
Total time on Monday and Sunday = 39 minutes

Now, we know that Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. So, we can calculate the number of minutes he needs to exercise on Tuesday as follows:

303," To find out how many books Elise sold in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the current year (the fourth year). We know that she sold 45 books this year and that there are currently 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books she has sold throughout the four years is:

Total books sold = Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the second year + Books sold in the third year + Books sold in the fourth year

We know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the fourth year. Let's call the number of books sold in the first year ""x."" Then, the number of books sold in the second year would be ""2x.""

We also know that Elise has sold a total of 250 books and that there are currently 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books she has sold throughout the four years is:

250 = x + 2x + Sales in the third year + 45

Simplifying this equation:

250 = 3x + 45

Subtracting 45 from both sides:

205 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 68.33 (approximately)

Since the number of books must be a whole number, we can round up the number of books Elise sold in the first year to 69 and adjust the number of books she sold in the second year accordingly:

Books sold in the first year = 69
Books sold in the second year = 2 * 69 = 138

Since Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose that amount of weight, we can find her weight loss rate by dividing the weight lost by the number of weeks it took.

Sandy's weight loss rate: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same 8 pounds that Joey lost in a single week, we can divide the weight Joey lost by Sandy's weight loss rate:

Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks

Number of arms = \frac{Number \ of \ days}{Days \ until \ next \ arm} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \ arms

Next, let's find out how many legs will grow:
Number of legs = \frac{Number \ of \ days}{Days \ until \ next \ leg} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \ legs

Since we want the total number of new limbs, we add the number of arms and legs together:

311," To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we first need to determine how many eggs each person eats every day and then calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week.

Let's denote the number of people who eat three eggs each day as x, and the number of people who eat two eggs each day as y. We know that x + y = 5 (total number of people in the family).

The daily egg consumption for x people is 3x eggs, and for y people is 2y eggs. So, the total number of eggs consumed daily is 3x + 2y.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 7 * (3x + 2y).

Substituting x = 3 and y = 2 in the equation x +y = 5, we get x = 3 and y = 2.

So, the family consumes 3 eggs each day for 3 people, which is 9 eggs daily. And they consume 2 eggs each day for 2 people, which is 4 eggs daily.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool her coffee by 65 degrees. We know that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. So, the number of ice cubes required can be calculated as follows:

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling required / Cooling per ice cube

Total cooling required = 65 degrees * 13 milliliters/degree

Number of ice cubes = 65 * 13 = 859 ice cubes

Now, let's calculate the volume of water in these ice cubes:

We know that 2 old records are equivalent to 1 new record, so we can set up a proportion to find out how many old records were traded for 1 new record:

2 old records :: 1 new record

Let x be the number of old records each person brought in. Then, the number of new records each person left with is x/2. The total number of new records all 5 people left with is 7, so we can set up the following equation:

x + x + x + x + x = 2 * (x/2 + x/2 + x/2 + x/2 + x/2)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5x = 7 * x

Dividing both sides by x, we get:

5 = 7

This equation is not true, which means that there is no solution to this problem. It's possible that there was a mistake in the problem statement or that some information is missing. Without enough information, it's not possible to determine how many old records the 5 people brought in.

325," To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers in the company.

We know that there are 100 employees in total, and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of that number. So, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
Number of junior programmers = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can calculate their number and the total number of senior programmers as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
Number of senior programmers = 60

Now that we have the number of junior and senior programmers, we can calculate their monthly salaries and the total amount of money the company pays per month.

The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000, so the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The total amount of money paid to junior programmers per month is:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer
Total amount paid to junior programmers = 40 * $2000
Total amount paid to junior programmers = $80,000

The total amount of money paid to senior programmers per month is:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer
Total amount paid to senior programmers = 60 * $2400
Total amount paid to senior programmers = $144,000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers:

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
Total amount paid to all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000
Total amount paid to all programmers = $224,000

The final answer is: The company pays $224,000 per month to all its programmers.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

328," To find out how long it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine how many percentage points the phone needs to reach 100% charged. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes. So, the number of minutes it takes to charge one percentage-point is 3 minutes.

To charge from 60% to 100%, we need to find the difference in percentage points and then divide that by the charging rate in percentage points per minute:

Percentage points to charge: 100% - 60% = 40%
Minutes to charge one percentage-point: 3 minutes
Minutes to charge 40 percentage-points: 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the charging time from minutes to hours:

330," To calculate the total amount paid by the customer on this shopping trip, we need to determine the amount spent after applying the rewards and the coupon.

First, let's find out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip:

Rewards earned = Spending in last trip / Rewards threshold
Rewards earned = $80 / $20
Rewards earned = 4

Since the customer used twice the amount of rewards on this shopping trip, they used 8 rewards.

Now, let's calculate the discount provided by the rewards:

Discount from rewards = Number of rewards * Rewards discount per reward
Discount from rewards = 8 * $1
Discount from rewards = $8

Next, let's find out how much the customer spent before applying the rewards and the coupon:

Amount spent before discounts = Amount spent in this trip + Rewards earned * Rewards threshold
Amount spent before discounts = $43 + 4 * $20
Amount spent before discounts = $43 + $80
Amount spent before discounts = $123

Now, let's calculate the discount provided by the coupon:

Discount from coupon = Rewards earned * Coupon discount per reward
Discount from coupon = 4 * (2 * $1)
Discount from coupon = 4 * $2
Discount from coupon = $8

Finally, let's calculate the total amount paid by the customer:

Annual earnings for Job A = Hourly wage * Hours worked per year
Annual earnings for Job A = $15 * 2000
Annual earnings for Job A = $30,000

Now, let's calculate Nick's net income for Job B after accounting for property tax and income tax. The property tax is $6,000, and the net income is $42,000. First, we need to find the gross income:

Gross income for Job B = Net income + Property tax
Gross income for Job B = $42,000 + $6,000
Gross income for Job B = $48,000

Next, we need to calculate the income tax. The income tax rate is 10%, so:

Income tax = Gross income * Income tax rate
Income tax = $48,000 * 0.1
Income tax = $4,800

Now, we can find Nick's net income for Job B:

Net income for Job B = Gross income - Income tax
Net income for Job B = $48,000 - $4,800
Net income for Job B = $43,200

To find the difference in net income between the two jobs, we can subtract Nick's net income for Job A from his net income for Job B:

Size of each equal group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Size of each equal group = 200 / 3 ≈ 66.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round down the size of each equal group to 66 students.

Now, we know that the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups. So, we can find the size of the smallest group by subtracting 10 from the size of each equal group:

3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds (50 pounds for the frog + 10 pounds difference).
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs 30 pounds (50 pounds for the frog - 20 pounds difference).

Now we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Total weight = Weight of pink frog + Weight of blue beetle + Weight of green toad + Weight of yellow snake + Weight of red bird + Weight of container

Total weight = 50 pounds (pink frog) + 50 pounds (blue beetle) + 50 pounds (green toad) + 60 pounds (yellow snake) + 30 pounds (red bird) + 20 pounds (container)

To find the number of new outfits she received at the shower, we can set up an equation: 2 * number of new outfits = total number of outfits from the shower

We know that she received 24 outfits from her friend, so the total number of outfits she has is 24 + number of new outfits.

Substituting the equation into the total equation: 2 * number of new outfits + 24 = total number of outfits

Now, let's find the number of new outfits she received at the shower. Her mom gave her an additional 15 outfits. So, the total number of outfits Laurel has is 24 + number of new outfits + 15.

Substituting the value of the outfits her mom gave her into the equation: 2 * number of new outfits + 24 + 15 = total number of outfits

Simplifying the equation: 2 * number of new outfits + 39 = total number of outfits

To find the number of new outfits, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 39 from both sides: 2 * number of new outfits = total number of outfits - 39

Now, we can find the total number of outfits by adding the number of outfits she received from her friend and the number of new outfits she received at the shower and from her mom: total number of outfits = 24 + number of new outfits + 15

Substituting the equation for the number of new outfits into the total equation: total number of outfits = 24 + (2 * number of new outfits) + 15

Simplifying the equation: total number of outfits = 2 * number of new outfits + 39

Now, we can use the equation we found earlier to solve for the number of new outfits: 2 * number of new outfits = total number of outfits - 39

Dividing both sides by 2: number of new outfits = (total number of outfits - 39) / 2

The answer is: (total number of outfits - 39) / 2.

To find the exact number of outfits, we need to know the total number of outfits Laurel has. Let's assume she has 50 outfits in total:

To find this value, we can set up an inequality:

x + 5 < 2x + 10

Solving for x:

x < 5
x < 2x + 5
x < (2x + 5)/1
x < x + 5/1
x < x + 5
x < 5 (x is less than 5)
x < (x + 5)/2
x < 2x/2 + 5/2
x < x + 5/2
x < 5/2 + x
x < 6

Since x cannot be less than 5 (as per the given information), the only valid solution is x = 6.

So, the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. The tallest tree is 2(6 + 6 + 5) = 2(17) = 34.

359," To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he had left after buying gumballs.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gumballs:
Cost of gumballs = Number of gumballs * Price per gumball
Cost of gumballs = 40 * $0.05
Cost of gumballs = $2

Next, we'll find out how much change Billy had after buying gumballs:
Change = Money given - Cost of candy - Cost of gumballs
Change = $10 - (Cost of candy) - $2

Now, we know that Billy spends half of his change on gumballs, so the other half must be the cost of the candy:
Cost of candy = Change / 2

Since we don't know the exact change Billy had, we cannot directly calculate the number of pounds of candy he bought. However, we can set up an equation to find the relationship between the cost of candy, the price per pound of candy, and the weight of the candy:

Cost of candy = Change / 2
Cost of candy = ($10 - Cost of candy - $2) / 2

To solve for the cost of candy, we can use trial and error or solve the quadratic equation:

Cost of candy = ($10 - Cost of candy - $2) / 2
Cost of candy = ($8 - Cost of candy) / 2
Cost of candy * 2 = $8 - Cost of candy
2 * Cost of candy = $8
Cost of candy = $4

Now that we know the cost of the candy, we can calculate the weight of the candy:
Weight of candy = Cost of candy / Price per pound
Weight of candy = $4 / $1.5
Weight of candy = 2.67 pounds

Result: Billy bought approximately 2.67 pounds of candy.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
360," To find the age of Carver's son, we first need to determine how old Carver would be if he was twice his current age. We know that Carver is 45 years old and that he is 5 years less than twice that age, so we can set up the equation:

Carver's age = Half of his age twice - 5

Let's solve for the half of his age twice:

Half of Carver's age twice = Carver's age + 5

Now, we can find the age of Carver's son by subtracting Carver's age from half of his age twice:

Carver's son's age = Half of Carver's age twice - Carver's age

Substituting Carver's age (45) into the equation:

Carver's son's age = (2 * 45 + 5) - 45

Calculate the value inside the parentheses:

Carver's son's age = (90 + 5) - 45

Now, add 5 and subtract 45:

Carver's son's age = 95 - 45

Finally, subtract 45 from 95:

Carver's son's age = 50

So, Carver's son is 50 years old.

361," To find out how many days the train goes between services, we first need to determine the total distance traveled during one trip and then calculate how many trips the train makes before needing a service.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first city. Let's call the combined distance ""d."" Then, we have:

100 miles + 50 miles < d
150 miles < d

So, the total distance traveled during one trip is d = 150 miles + 75 miles = 225 miles.

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled per day is 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles.

Now, we need to find out how many days the train goes before needing a service, which is every 18,000 miles. To calculate this, we divide the total miles the train travels before needing a service by the daily mileage:

Total miles before service = 18,000 miles
Daily mileage = 675 miles

Number of days between services = Total miles before service / Daily mileage
= 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day
≈ 26.67 days

Since the train cannot travel a fraction of a day, it goes for service approximately every 27 days.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
362," To find the amount of stuffing Mark needs for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we first need to determine the amount of stuffing for one collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a Chihuahua bed, we can find the average by adding the amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed and a Chihuahua bed and dividing by 2.

Average stuffing for a collie bed = (Stuffing for a Rottweiler bed + Stuffing for a Chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = (8 lb + 2 lb) / 2
Average stuffing for a collie bed = 6 lb

Now that we know the amount of stuffing for one collie bed, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 3 * 6 lb
Stuffing for 3 collie beds = 18 lb

Next, we'll calculate the amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 lb
Stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds = 8 lb

Finally, we'll add the amount of stuffing for the collie and chihuahua beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

Total stuffing needed = Stuffing for collie beds + Stuffing for chihuahua beds
Total stuffing needed = 18 lb + 8 lb
Total stuffing needed = 26 lb

First, let's find the time it took John to drive to his friend's house:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time to friend's house = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2 hours and 40 minutes (approximately)

Next, let's find the time it took John for the detour:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time for detour = 10 miles / 70 mph = approximately 0.14 hours or 8.4 minutes

Finally, let's find the time it took John to drive back home:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

367," Let's denote the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. Then, according to the problem, x = 3.

The number of shoplifters is 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, so shoplifters = 4x.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * shoplifters = 3 * 4x = 12x.

The total number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart was 50. So, we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + 12x = 50

Combining the terms with x, we get:

16x = 50

Now, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides of the equation by 16:

x = 50 / 16
x = 3.125

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames and etching for all 44 seniors:
Cost of picture frame per senior = $20
Cost of etching per senior = $20 * 1.2 = $24
Total cost for picture frames and etching for all seniors = 44 * ($20 + $24) = $1,328

Next, let's find the cost of the picture frames, etching, and cords for the officers:
Number of officers = 44 * 0.25 = 11
Cost of picture frame and etching for each officer = $20 + $24 = $44

370," To find the total cost of Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to determine the cost savings from making it himself. We know that the market price of the wallpaper is $400, and he saves 20% on the materials cost.

Let's denote the original cost of the wallpaper as C. Then, the cost savings from making it himself is 20% of C. We can write this as an equation:

Cost savings = 0.2 * C

Since Ethan saves this amount, the total cost of making the wallpaper himself is the original cost minus the cost savings:

Total cost = C - Cost savings

Substituting the equation for cost savings, we get:

Total cost = C - 0.2 * C

Combining the terms, we have:

Total cost = 0.8 * C

Now we need to find the value of C to satisfy the given condition that the market price is $400. We can set up the equation:

381," To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first need to calculate the total distance each person hiked.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours:
Total distance covered by Cho = Speed * Time
Total distance covered by Cho = 14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours
Total distance covered by Cho = 112 kilometers

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours:
Total distance covered by Chloe = Speed * Time
Total distance covered by Chloe = 9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours
Total distance covered by Chloe = 45 kilometers

Now, we can find the difference in the total distance covered by Cho and Chloe:
Difference in distance = Total distance covered by Cho - Total distance covered by Chloe
Difference in distance = 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers
Difference in distance = 67 kilometers

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

382," Let's denote the number of silver pesos that Anna has as S\_Anna and the number of silver pesos that Axel has as S\_Axel. We know that S\_Anna = 2 * S\_Axel.

We also know that Axel has 50 silver pesos, so S\_Axel = 50. Therefore, S\_Anna = 2 * S\_Axel = 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

We don't have information about the number of gold pesos that Anna has, so let's denote it as G\_Anna. We know that Axel has 80 gold pesos, so G\_Axel = 80.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is S\_Axel + S\_Anna = 50 + 100 = \boxed{150}.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is G\_Axel + G\_Anna = 80 + G\_Anna. We don't have enough information to find the exact value of G\_Anna, so we can't give a definitive answer for the total number of gold pesos they have together.

383," To find Millie's profit per hour, we first need to determine how many cups of lemonade she makes in total and then calculate her revenue and costs per hour.

1. First, let's find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought:
   Cups of lemonade = Number of pitchers * Cups per pitcher
   = 3 * 12
   = 36 cups

2. Next, we'll calculate Millie's revenue per hour by finding out how many cups she sells per hour and then multiplying that by the price per cup:
   Cups sold per hour = 4
   Revenue per hour = Cups sold per hour * Price per cup
   = 4 * $1
   = $4

3. Now, we'll calculate Millie's costs per hour by finding out how long it takes her to make all the lemonade and then multiplying that by her hourly wage (implicitly given as the cost of supplies):
   Time to make all the lemonade = Number of pitchers * Time to make one pitcher
   Let's assume it takes Millie 30 minutes to make one pitcher (since she made 3 pitchers in total and worked for 1.5 hours):
   Time to make all the lemonade = 3 * 0.5 hours
   Hourly wage = Cost per supplies / Time to make all the lemonade
   Let's assume Millie spends $18 on supplies:
   Hourly wage = $18 / (3 * 0.5)
   Hourly wage = $18 / 1.5
   Hourly wage = $12
   Costs per hour = Hourly wage

4. Finally, we'll calculate Millie's profit per hour by subtracting her costs per hour from her revenue per hour:
   Profit per hour = Revenue per hour - Costs per hour
   = $4 - $12
   = -$8

However, a negative profit per hour means that Millie is losing money. This is not a sustainable business model. To make a profit, Millie needs to either sell more lemonade or reduce her costs (e.g., by buying supplies in bulk or finding a cheaper source).

### Final result: Millie makes a loss of $8 per hour with her current lemonade stand setup.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
384," To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the amount of land he sold. We know that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left.

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x. Then, the amount of land Mr. Ruther sold is 3/5 of x. We can set up an equation to represent the given information:

Initial land = Sold land + Remaining land
x = (3/5)x + 12.8

To solve for x, we first need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting (3/5)x from both sides:

(1 - 3/5)x = 12.8

Now, we can simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying both sides by 5/3 to get rid of the fraction:

x = (5/3) * 12.8

Finally, we can calculate the value of x:

x = 25.33333333333 hectares

Since we cannot have a decimal value for the initial land, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is 26 hectares.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
385," First, let's find out how many girls and boys are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are girls and 50% are boys, we have:

Number of girls = Total members * Percentage of girls
= 52 * 0.5
= 26

Number of boys = Total members * Percentage of boys
= 52 * 0.5
= 26

Now, let's calculate how many girls could perform on the day of the show. Since half of them couldn't make it, we have:

Number of girls who could perform = Number of girls * (1 - Percentage unable to perform)
= 26 * (1 - 0.5)
= 26 * 0.5
= 13

Since there were 3 teachers who sang with them, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

First, let's calculate the cost of 6 erasers:
Cost of 1 eraser = $2
Cost of 6 erasers = $2 * 6 = $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of 8 pencils:
Cost of 1 pencil = $3
Cost of 8 pencils = $3 * 8 = $24

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of erasers + Cost of pencils
Total cost = $12 + $24
Total cost = $36

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

389," To find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets for all 9 rides for Dasha, we first need to determine the cost of buying individual tickets for both David and Dasha.

The cost of one ride ticket is $2, and there are 9 rides. So, the cost for David to buy 9 ride tickets would be 9 * $2 = $18.

Since Dasha is also riding all 9 rides, the cost for her to buy 9 ride tickets would be an additional 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, the total cost for both David and Dasha to buy individual tickets for all 9 rides would be $18 (for David) + $18 (for Dasha) = $36.

However, David bought a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides for free. So, the cost savings for David is the difference between the cost of buying individual tickets for both him and Dasha and the cost of David's ride bracelet.

The answer is: David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets for all 9 rides for himself and Dasha.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

391," To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has based on their ratio.

Let x be the number of popsicles Betty has. Then, Sam has 6x popsicles. The total number of popsicles they have together is 5x + 6x = 11x. Since they have a total of 165 popsicles, we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165
11x = 165
x = 15

Now that we know Betty has 15 popsicles, we can find out how many popsicles Sam has:

Sam's popsicles = 6 * Betty's popsicles
Sam's popsicles = 6 * 15
Sam's popsicles = 90

Finally, to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we can subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

Difference in popsicles = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles
Difference in popsicles = 90 - 15

393," Carol spent 4 hours writing a song, which is her composition time. She then spent half that time, or 2 hours, recording the song. Finally, she spent 90 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours, editing the recording.

To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing by the total time she spent on the project and then multiply by 100%:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time spent) * 100%

First, let's find the total time Carol spent on the project:

Total time spent = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total time spent = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time spent = 7.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing:

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100%
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
394," To find out how many books Wendy needs, we first need to determine how many books she currently has, which is double the number of books she wants to add. Let's call the number of books she currently has ""x"".

According to the problem, Wendy wants to add 20 more than double the number of books she currently has. So, the total number of books she needs is:

x (current number of books) + 20 + 2x (books to be added)

Since we know that the number of books she wants to add is double the current number of books, we can write the equation as:

x + 2x + 20

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 20

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since Wendy wants to place the books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, and each row and column can hold one book, the total capacity of the shelving system is:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

Since Wendy currently has fewer books than the capacity of the shelving system, we can find the value of x by dividing the capacity of the shelving system by 3 (since she currently has one-third of the total number of books she wants to have):

x = 36 / 3 = 12 books

Now that we know Wendy currently has 12 books, we can find the total number of books she needs:

3x + 20 = 3(12) + 20 = 36 + 20 = 56 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 56 books to complete her task. ###

396," First, let's find out how many slices Bill and Mark received. Bill got 1/3 of the pizza, so that's 12 slices multiplied by 1/3, which equals 4 slices. Mark got 1/4 of the pizza, so that's 12 slices multiplied by 1/4, which equals 3 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so we subtract those from the original number of slices: 12 slices - 2 slices = 10 slices.

Now, we need to account for the slices Bill and Mark received. Bill had 4 slices, and Mark had 3 slices, so together they had 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices Jenny gave away and the slices Bill and Mark ate: 12 slices - 2 slices (Jenny) - 4 slices (Bill) - 3 slices (Mark) = 12 - 2 - 4 - 3 = 1 slices.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure everyone gets a fair share. So, we add one slice back: 11 slices.

397," Mark currently has $50 in his bank account. He earns $10 per day at his work, so his daily income is $10. The bike he wants to buy costs $300. To find out how many days Mark needs to save up enough money to buy the bike, we need to determine the difference between the amount of money he currently has and the cost of the bike, and then divide that difference by his daily income.

Difference in money needed = Cost of bike - Current money
Difference in money needed = $300 - $50
Difference in money needed = $255

Now, we can find out how many days Mark needs to save up that amount of money by dividing the difference in money needed by his daily income:

Number of days = Difference in money needed / Daily income
Number of days = $255 / $10
Number of days = 25.5

Since Mark cannot save half a day, he needs to save for an additional full day to be able to afford the bike. Therefore, Mark needs to save for 26 days to buy the bike.

1. Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
2. Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

To find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age in relation to Erica's age.

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can set up the following equation:

Alice's age = Erica's age + Beth's age + Alice's age difference with Beth

We know that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica. So, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = \boxed{35}.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = \boxed{42}.

Therefore, the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is 42 (Alice's age) - 30 (Erica's age) = \boxed{12}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

402," To find out how many more bags of flour Mark has to buy compared to the number of bottles of milk, we first need to determine how much flour and milk he needs for a quadruple batch, and then calculate the difference between the amount of flour and milk required.

A normal batch of brownies requires:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, Mark will need:
- 4 * 3 = 12 cups of flour
- 4 * 1 = 4 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need:
- 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6 bags

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need:
- 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles

The difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark has to buy is:

403," First, let's calculate how many watt-hours (Wh) of energy Mel uses each day with the air conditioner. We know that the air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours a day:

900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

Now, we need to convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh). We know that 1 kWh equals 1000 watt-hours:

7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

So, Mel uses 7.2 kWh of energy each day with the air conditioner.

Next, we need to find out how many kWh of energy he saves each day by using the air conditioner for only 3 hours instead of 8 hours. We know that he saves 5 hours a day:

7.2 kWh * (1 - 3 hours / 8 hours) = 7.2 kWh * 0.375 = 2.684 kWh

So, Mel saves 2.684 kWh of energy each day by using the air conditioner for only 3 hours instead of 8 hours.

Finally, to find out how many kWh of energy Mel saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days:

Next, we'll calculate the amount of meat and cheese required for each sandwich and then find the total amount needed for all 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires:
- 1 pound of meat
- 1 pound of cheese

Total pounds of meat and cheese for 5 sandwiches:
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

Cost of meat:
- 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00

Cost of cheese:
- 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00

Next, we need to find out how many corns Allan bought or sold. We know that he bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since there are currently 80 corns and 40 cannolis, the difference in the number of corns is 80 + 40 - 40 = <<80+40-40=120>>120.

So, Allan initially had 80 corns, and he bought or sold 120 corns. Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 80 + 40 + 60 = <<80+40+60=180>>180.

We know that Elliott finished half of his daily steps of 10,000 during his walks to and from school. So, he took:

\text{Steps during walks to and from school} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000

He also took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, so the total number of steps Elliott took before his jog is:

\text{Total steps before jog} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Now, we know that Elliott had 2,000 steps left after his jog. So, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

\text{Steps during jog} = 10,000 - \text{Total steps before jog} = 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Toby to read these 9,000 words. We know that Toby can read 300 words per minute, so:

$$9,000 \text{ words} / 300 \text{ words/minute} = 30 \text{ minutes}$$

Now, let's add the time it takes Toby to get to the airport, which is 10 minutes.

$$30 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 10 \text{ minutes (travel)} = 40 \text{ minutes}$$

409," To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we first need to find out how many employees the company had in each month and then calculate the total payroll for each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. The hourly wage was $15, and they worked for a 40-hour workweek. So, the total compensation for one employee in a week is:

Compensation per employee = Hourly wage * Hours worked per week
Compensation per employee = $15 * 40
Compensation per employee = $600

Since there were 40 employees in May, the total payroll for May is:

Total payroll in May = Compensation per employee * Number of employees
Total payroll in May = $600 * 40
Total payroll in May = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means that 10 employees left the company. So, there were 30 employees in June. The total compensation for one employee in a week remained the same, i.e., $600. The total payroll for June is:

Total payroll in June = Compensation per employee * Number of employees
Total payroll in June = $600 * 30
Total payroll in June = $18,000

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we simply add the payroll amounts for both months:

Total payroll in May and June = Total payroll in May + Total payroll in June
Total payroll in May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payroll in May and June = $42,000

Next, we add the cost of the seashells and the magnets to the cost of the taffy. The cost of the seashells is $1.50, and the cost of the 4 magnets is $0.25 x 4 = $1.

Therefore, the total amount Sally spent is $6 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $8.50.

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to each package:
Discount on the first package: $400 * 0.2 = $80
Discount on the second package: $800 * 0.2 = $160

So, the total discount Tim received is: $80 + $160 = $240

Next, let's find the total cost of the fireworks before the discount: $400 + $800 = $1200

Finally, let's calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks: $1200 - $240 (discount) = $960

Now, we don't have any information about the percentage of candles that have both defects. Let's assume for the sake of an example that 1% of the dangerous candles have both defects. Then,

Candles with both defects = Dangerous candles * Percentage of candles with both defects
= 2500 * 0.01

So, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and x apples from the shortest trees.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.

She also gathers 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * x = <<3*x=x*3=3x>>3x apples from the shortest trees.

Together, they have gathered 30 (Joanne's apples from tallest trees) + x (Joanne's apples from shortest trees) + 60 (sister's apples from tallest trees) + 3x (sister's apples from shortest trees) = 3x + 61 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

We know that they have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, so the number of apples they gathered from the average trees must be 500 - (3x + 61).

We have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel has two heads (one for each hump) and each dromedary has one head, we can write the equation: C * 2 + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304. Since each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, we can write the equation: C * 2 + D = 304.

To find the solution, we need to isolate one variable in the first equation and then set both equations equal to each other. Let's isolate D in the first equation: D = 180 - C * 2.

Now, let's set both equations equal to each other: C * 2 + D = 180 and C * 2+ D = 304.

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: C * 2 + D - (C * 2 + D) = 304 - 180. This simplifies to: 0 = 124.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse, so we need to find out how many cats that is. We know that 3/5 of 45 is equal to (3/5) * 45.

To calculate this, we can either perform the multiplication or find a common multiple for 3 and 5 and then divide by 5. In this case, the common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. So, we can write 3/5 as 3/15 + 12/15 = 3/15 + (4/5), which simplifies to 12/15 cats.

Now, we can subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining number of cats: 45 - 12 = <<45-12=33>>33 cats.

426," To find the cost of the soup, we need to know the cost of the bagel first. The bagel cost $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so we calculate the cost of the soup by adding 25% to the cost of the bagel:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + (Cost of bagel * 0.25)
Cost of soup = $4 + ($4 * 0.25)
Cost of soup = $4 + $1
Cost of soup = $5

The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so:

Cost of cake = Cost of bagel / 2
Cost of cake = $4 / 2
Cost of cake = $2

Now we can find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner by adding the cost of the soup and the cost of the cake to the cost of the bagel:

Total cost = Cost of bagel + Cost of soup + Cost of cake
Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2
Total cost = $11

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

427," To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we first need to determine how many cards he sells. Let's call the number of cards he started with ""x.""

He keeps 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sells is (2/3)x. The total amount of money he makes from selling these cards is ($1.5) x (number of cards he sells) = ($1.5) x (2/3)x = $1.5 * x / 1/3 = $4.5x.

He goes to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash, so we need to find the number of cards that sold for $50:

$50 = $4.5x
x = $50 / $4.5 ≈ 111.11

Since Kenny can't have a fraction of a card, he must have started with at least 112 cards to sell 111 cards for $166.5 and keep one card for himself. However, since he only makes $4.5 per card, he can only make $166.4 from selling 111 cards, which is not enough for the $100 amusement park ticket and $50 spending cash.

Therefore, Kenny must have started with a larger number of cards. Let's try 120 cards:

$100 = $1.5x (total amount of money from selling all cards)
$100 = $1.5 * 120
$100 = 180

This means Kenny started with 120 cards.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. Five separate utensils, each costing $5.00, will cost a total of $5 x 5 = $25.00.

So, the total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount: $165.00 x 0.2 = $33.00.

So, the discount amount is $33.00.

To find the total cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original total: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

1/4 container = 3 gallons / 4 = 3/4 gallons

Finally, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that:

1 gallon = 128 pints

So, 3/4 gallon is equal to:

Number of chip bags = Total money spent on chips / Price per chip bag
Number of chip bags = $5 / 0.40
Number of chip bags = 12.5

Since George can't buy half a bag of chips, we'll round down to 12 chip bags.

Next, we'll find out how much money George spent on chips:

Money spent on chips = Number of chip bags * Price per chip bag
Money spent on chips = 12 * 0.40
Money spent on chips = $4.80

Now, we know that George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. So, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:

Money spent on candy bars = Total money spent - Money spent on chips
Money spent on candy bars = $5 - $4.80
Money spent on candy bars = $0.20

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents or $0.75, we can't buy just 20 cents worth of candy bars. Therefore, George didn't buy any candy bars with the given information.

439," Let's denote the time it takes Wayne to travel from his hotel to the theater as $w$. Bernadette's travel time is $4w$ since it takes her four times as long. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we need to find the time difference between their arrivals.

Let $b$ be the time Bernadette leaves her apartment. Then, Wayne arrives at the theater at $w$ and Bernadette arrives at $w + 5$ minutes.

Since Bernadette's travel time is $4w$, we can set up the equation:

$$w + 5 = 4w$$

To solve for $w$, subtract $5$ from both sides and then divide both sides by $3$:

$$w = \frac{5}{3}$$

Now, let's find the time difference between Bernadette's departure and Wayne's departure:

$$b = w - \frac{5}{3}$$

Substitute $w = \frac{5}{3}$:

$$b = \frac{5}{3} - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{0}{3} = 0$$

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It seems there is a mistake in the problem statement or some missing information. Since Bernadette's travel time is four times longer than Wayne's, she should leave earlier than Wayne by a factor of four. However, the problem states that she should leave only 5 minutes earlier, which doesn't make sense given the information provided.

Result: The problem contains an error. Bernadette should leave earlier than Wayne by a factor of four, but the exact time difference isn't provided in the problem.

To calculate the time difference if the problem was correct, Bernadette should leave $4$ times earlier than Wayne:

$$b = w \cdot 0.25$$

$$b = \frac{5}{3} \cdot 0.25 = \frac{5}{12}$$

So Bernadette should leave $\frac{5}{12}$ hours earlier than Wayne.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}
440," To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

We are given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). To find the width, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length * Width

Substituting the given values:

360 sq ft = 3 yd * Width

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet since the perimeter is given in feet. We know that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So, 3 yards is equal to 9 feet.

Now, we can find the width:

360 sq ft = 9 ft * Width
Width = 360 sq ft / 9 ft
Width = 40 ft

Now, we can find the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 ft + 40 ft)
Perimeter = 2 * (49 ft)
Perimeter = 98 ft

Temperature increase from baking = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease from opening the window for 30 minutes:

Time the window is open = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
Temperature decrease per time unit = 2 degrees/(10 minutes) * (10 minutes/0.5 hours) = 8 degrees/hour
Temperature decrease from opening the window = 8 degrees/hour * 0.5 hours = 4 degrees

Now, we can find the final temperature by adding the initial temperature increase from baking and the final temperature decrease from opening the window:

Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase from baking - Temperature decrease from opening the window

Final temperature = 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 4 degrees = 51 degrees

Swim time for James = Swim time for Jon - (10% of Swim time for Jon)
Swim time for James = 40 minutes - (0.1 * 40 minutes)
Swim time for James = 40 minutes - 4 minutes
Swim time for James = 36 minutes

Now let's find out how long it took James for the bike ride. We know it took him 5 minutes longer than Jon, so:

Bike ride time for James = Bike ride time for Jon + 5 minutes
Bike ride time for James = 1 hour and 20 minutes + 5 minutes
Bike ride time for James = 1 hour and 25 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes in total, the difference between their times for the swim, bike ride, and run must add up to 10 minutes. Let's find out how long it took James for the run:

Run time for James = Total time difference - (Swim time difference + Bike ride time difference)
Run time for James = 10 minutes - (36 minutes - 40 minutes + 5 minutes + (Jon's run time - 50 minutes))
Run time for James = 10 minutes - (31 minutes + (Jon's run time - 50 minutes))

To find Jon's run time, we know that it took him 50 minutes and James was 10 minutes slower, so:

Jon's run time = Run time for James + 10 minutes
Jon's run time = 50 minutes + 10 minutes
Jon's run time = 60 minutes

Now we can find the run time for James:

Run time for James = 10 minutes - (31 minutes + (60 minutes - 50 minutes))

Since each egg is a single entity, we can say that he won't be able to place 16 eggs worth of space on the trays. But since the question asks for the number of eggs he won't be able to place, the answer is that he won't be able to place 2 eggs (since 2 eggs make up 16 eggs worth of space).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}

493," First, let's calculate the price of one pack of razors after the buy one get one free sale. The price of one pack is $4.00, so the price of two packs is $4.00 * 2 = $<<4.00*2=8.00>>8.00. Since she gets one pack for free, the actual cost is $8.00 for both packs.

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon, which reduces the cost by that amount. So, the total cost for both packs is $8.00 - $2.00 = $<<8.00-2.00=6.00>>6.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of one individual razor. Each pack contains 4 razors, so the cost of two packs is enough for 8 razors. Therefore, the cost of one razor is $6.00 / 8 = $<<6.00/8=0.75>>0.75 cents.

494," To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to determine the height of each layer in inches and then convert it to feet.

1. The height of the bottom layer with 4 girls: Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, the height of one cheerleader is 64 inches. The height of the bottom layer is therefore 4 * 64 = 256 inches.
2. The height of the middle layer with 3 girls: The girls on this layer are 6 inches shorter than the girls on the bottom layer, so they are 58 inches tall (64 inches - 6 inches). The height of the middle layer is therefore 3 * 58 = 171 inches.
3. The height of the top layer with 2 girls: The girls on this layer are 4 inches shorter than the girls on the middle layer, so they are 54 inches tall (58 inches - 4 inches). The height of the top layer is therefore 2 * 54 = 108 inches.
4. The height of the shortest girl at the top: We know that she is 60 inches tall.

Now, let's convert all the heights to feet:

1. 256 inches = 21.33 feet (256 inches / 12 inches/foot)
2. 171 inches = 14.25 feet (171 inches / 12 inches/foot)
3. 108 inches = 9 feet (108 inches / 12 inches/foot)
4. 60 inches = 5 feet (60 inches / 12 inches/foot)

So, the total height of the human pyramid is 21.33 feet + 14.25 feet + 9 feet + 5 feet = \boxed{49.93 \text{ feet}}.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

Now we know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is then. So we can set up the equation:

Angela's age = Brett's age + 4 years * 3

Substitute the known value for Brett's age in four years:

499," To find the number of guests where the cost of both venues is equal, we need to find the number of guests for each venue where the sum of the venue cost and the food cost is equal.

For the first venue:
Cost = Flat fee + Food cost per person * Number of guests
Cost = $200 + $5 * Number of guests

For the second venue:
Cost = Cost per person * Number of guests
Cost = $25 * Number of guests

To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we need to set the two costs equal to each other and solve for the number of guests:

$200 + $5 * Number of guests = $25 * Number of guests

First, we can get rid of the $200 term by subtracting it from both sides:

$5 * Number of guests = $25 * Number of guests - $200

Next, we can simplify the right side of the equation by distributing the $-200$ term:

$5 * Number of guests = -$20 * Number of guests + $25 * Number of guests - $200

Now, we can combine like terms on the right side:

$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests + ($5 * Number of guests - $20 * Number of guests) - $200

We can factor out $5 * Number of guests$ on the left side:

$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests + ($5 * Number of guests - $20 * Number of guests) - $200
$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests + ($5 * Number of guests - $20 * Number of guests) - $200
$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests + ($5 * (Number of guests - 4)) - $200

Now, we can solve for the number of guests by setting the equation equal to zero and solving for Number of guests:

$5 * Number of guests = $5 * (Number of guests - 4) - $200
$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests - $5 * 4 - $200
$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests - $20 * 4 - $200
$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests - $80 - $200
$5 * Number of guests = $5 * Number of guests - $280
$5 * Number of guests = ($5 * Number of guests) - $280
$5 * Number of guests - $5 * Number of guests = -$280
-$5 * Number of guests = -$280
Number of guests = $280 / (-$5)
Number of guests = $280 / -5
Number of guests = -$56

Since the number of guests cannot be negative, this means that the first venue is always less expensive than the second venue, regardless of the number of guests.

500," Let's break down the information given in the problem and set up some equations to find the answer:

1. Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's denote the number of insects David found as ""d"" and the number of insects Bodhi found as ""b"". We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Lily found d + 7 insects
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found b/2 insects

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up another equation:

d + (d + 7) + b = 43

Now, we can solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for ""b"":

b = 2d + 7

Since we know that David found half of what Bodhi found, we can write:

d = b/2

Now, we can substitute ""d"" in the first equation with ""b/2"":

(b/2) + (b/2 + 7) + b = 43

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fractions:

b + b + 2b + 14 = 86

Combining like terms:

3b = 72

Dividing both sides by 3:

b = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found:

Lily found d + 7 = (b/2) + 7 = (24/2) + 7 = 13 + 7 = 20 insects

504," To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we first need to determine the cost of the other packs of gum. We know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum, and 1 pack of green apple gum. The cost of the grape gum is given as $2.

Let's denote the cost of one pack of strawberry gum as S, the cost of the small pack of green apple gum as A, and the number of packs of green apple gum as G. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) The total number of packs is 4, so S + S + A + G = 4
2) The total cost is $7, so 2S + S + A + G = $7

We can simplify the first equation by combining the two S terms:

S + S + A + G = 4
2S + A + G = 4

Now, we need to find a value for A and G that satisfy both equations. Since Suzie paid half as much for the green apple gum, we know that A is less than $2. Let's assume A = $1.

With A = $1, we can calculate G:

2S + A + G = 4
2S + $1 + G = 4
G = 4 - 2S - $1

Now, we can use the second equation to find S:

2S + S + A + G = $7
2S + S + $1 + (4 - 2S - $1) = $7
3S + 3 = $7
3S = $4
S = $1.33

505," To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget of $24, we first need to determine how many sticks he can get from each type of lumber and which one offers the best value for money.

From a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can make 200 sticks, and it costs $4. So, the cost per stick is $0.02 (2 cents).

From a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can make 400 sticks, and it costs $6. So, the cost per stick is $0.015 (1.5 cents).

Since the cost per stick is lower when using a 2 x 8 piece of wood, it would be more cost-effective for Frederick to buy that lumber.

Now, let's calculate how many sticks Frederick can make with his $24 budget when buying a 2 x 8 piece of wood:

Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
Remaining budget = $24 - $6 = $18

Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x. Then, the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 4x.

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the following system of equations:

1) 4x = 12 (number of onions)
2) 4x = 4 (number of potatoes)

Let's solve this system of equations.

From equation 1), we have x = 12 / 4 = 3. So, Sophia bought 3 times the number of onions that Rose bought.

From equation 2), we have x = 1. So, Sophia bought 1 time the number of potatoes that Rose bought.

Since Sophia bought 3 times the number of onions that Rose bought, and Rose bought 12 onions, then Sophia bought 3 * 12 = 36 onions.

Since Sophia bought the same number of potatoes as Rose, and Rose bought 4 potatoes, then Sophia bought 4 potatoes.

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 36 + 4 = 39 items (36 onions and 3 potatoes, but since potatoes are counted as one item each, we only count Sophia's purchase of potatoes as one item) at the market.

510," To calculate the calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by July 19th, we first need to determine how many days he has to reach this goal.

We know that today is December 31st, and his birthday is on July 19th. To find the number of days between these two dates, we can use the DATEDIF function in Excel or Google Sheets. This function calculates the number of days, months, or years between two dates.

In this case, we want to find the number of days between December 31, 2022, and July 19, 2023.

Using Excel or Google Sheets:
=DATEDIF(""2022-12-31"",""2023-07-19"",""d"")

Result: 151 days

Now that we know there are 151 days between December 31, 2022, and July 19, 2023, we can calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. (or 1 lb. per week), and he has 151 days to reach this goal, that means he needs to lose approximately 0.2 lbs. per day (30 lbs. / 151 days).

To lose 0.2 lbs. per day, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of 7000 calories per week (0.2 lbs. * 3500 calories per lb.). Since there are 7 days in a week, this equates to a daily calorie deficit of approximately 1000 calories per day (7000 calories per week / 7 days per week).

However, since we rounded up earlier when calculating the number of days between December 31, 2022, and July 19, 2023, we should add an extra day to account for this rounding error. Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 1025 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by July 19, 2023.

514," To find the cost of the house, we need to determine how much the lot costs and then find three times that amount for the house.

Let's denote the cost of the lot as L. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is 3L. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

L + 3L = $120,000

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

Now, we need to find the value of L. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

L = $120,000 / 4

So, the cost of the lot is:

L = $30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

Total number of bags = Packs bought * Bags per pack
The answer is: Total number of bags = 8 * 5 = 40 bags

Next, let's calculate the cost Tara paid for all the bags. Each pack cost $4, so:

Cost of all packs = Total number of packs * Cost per pack
Cost of all packs = 8 * $4 = $32

Since there are 5 bags in each pack, the cost of all the bags is:

Time it takes Royce = Time it takes Rob + 40 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 120 minutes + 40 minutes
Time it takes Royce = 160 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 160 minutes, or 1 hour and 40 minutes, to shingle a house.

520," To find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy for each grandchild, we need to calculate the number of skeins required to make one set of each item (hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks).

1. Hats: 2 skeins per hat
2. Scarves: 4 skeins per scarf
3. Sweaters: 12 skeins per sweater
4. Mittens: 1 skein per pair
5. Socks: 2 skeins per pair

Since all the grandchildren are the same size, Martha will be making one set of each item for each of them. So, for one grandchild, she will need:

Total skeins for one grandchild = Skeins for hats + Skeins for scarves + Skeins for sweater + Skeins for mittens + Skeins for socks
Total skeins for one grandchild = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2
Total skeins for one grandchild = 19 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, she will need to make 3 sets of each item, so the total number of skeins she will need is:

Total skeins for all grandchildren = Skeins for one grandchild * Number of grandchildren
Total skeins for all grandchildren = 19 * 3
Total skeins for all grandchildren = 57 skeins

The answer is: Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
521," To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we first need to determine how many problems he completed on Tuesday and Wednesday.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which was 12 problems. So, he completed 12 x 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 problems on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. Let's call the total number of problems left to complete ""x"". So, he completed x/4 problems on Wednesday.

We know that Chris has completed a total of 12 + 36 + x/4 problems so far. We also know that he has 100 problems in total. So, we can set up the equation:

12 + 36 + x/4 = 100

To solve for x, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

4(12 + 36 + x/4) = 4(100)

Now we can simplify the left side:

48 + 144 + x = 400

Next, we can subtract 48 and 144 from both sides to get all the terms on one side:

x = 202

So, Chris has 202 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

526," To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we first need to calculate her daily electric consumption with and without the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
After adding the new device, her daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Now, let's calculate her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device. We know that there are 7 days in a week.

Before adding the new device:
Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
Weekly bill = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126

After adding the new device:
Daily consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour
Weekly consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
Weekly bill = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147

527," To find out how long it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we first need to determine how long it takes one person to paint half a house. We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days.

Next, we need to find out how many hours are in 5 days. We know that:
1 day = 24 hours

So,
5 days = 5 * 24 = 120 hours

Therefore, it takes one person 120 hours to paint half a house. Since a whole house is twice the size of half a house, it would take one person 240 hours to paint a whole house.

Now, let's find out how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. Since they can all work at the same time, we can assume that the painting process is parallelizable, meaning that the combined effort of 5 people is equal to 5 times the effort of one person.

So, with 5 people working together, they can paint a whole house in 1/5th of the time it takes one person to paint a whole house.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 240 hours / 5 = 48 hours to paint a whole house.

528," Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia for each piece of furniture, Jenna has 20 - 2 = 18 sofas.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Ophelia has chairs, so Jenna has 3 * chairs.

We know that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia, so we can set up the following equation:

Ophelia's sofas = 20
Jenna's sofas = Ophelia's sofas - 2

Ophelia's chairs = x
Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1. Ophelia's sofas = 20
2. Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs

We can use the first equation to find Ophelia's chairs. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than Jenna, we can find the number of Jenna's chairs by adding 2 to Ophelia's sofas and then multiplying by 3:

Jenna's chairs = 3 * (Ophelia's sofas + 2)

Now we can find the total number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas = 20 + 18 = 38
Total chairs = Jenna's chairs = 3 * (20 + 2) = 3 * 22 = 66

530," To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of hours he spent working out in each week, except for the two instances where he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks and the one instance where he spent 6 hours in one week.

We know that Josh spent 4 hours working out every week for most of the 8 weeks. So, for the number of weeks where Josh worked out for 4 hours each, we have:

Number of weeks with 4 hours = Total number of weeks - Number of weeks with 5 hours (twice) - Number of weeks with 6 hours

Let's assume that Josh worked out for 8 weeks in total. Then, the number of weeks where he worked out for 4 hours each would be:

Number of weeks with 4 hours = 8 - 2 (for the two consecutive weeks with 5 hours) - 1 (for the week with 6 hours) = 5

So, Josh spent 5 weeks x 4 hours = <<5*4=20>>20 hours working out for 4 hours each.

Now, we need to find the number of hours he spent working out during the two weeks where he spent 5 hours each and the one week where he spent 6 hours.

Total hours spent working out = (5 weeks x 4 hours) + (2 weeks x 5 hours) + 1 week x 6 hours

Total hours spent working out = 20 hours + (2 weeks x 5 hours) + 6 hours

Total hours spent working out = 20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = <<20+10+6=36>>36 hours.

Therefore, Josh spent a total of 36 hours working out across the 8 weeks.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off the bus.
2. Then, 5 times as many people get on the bus, so 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on.
3. So, after the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 48 (initial number) - 8 (got off) + 40 (got on) = 56 passengers.
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off the bus.
5. And, 3 times fewer passengers get on, so 3 * 21 = 63 is the number of passengers who got on.
6. To find the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we need to subtract the passengers who got off and add the passengers who got on: 56 (after the first stop) - 21 (got off at the second stop) + 63 (got on at the second stop) = 110 passengers.

532," To find the age difference between Jame and his cousin now, we first need to determine when his cousin will turn 27. We know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so we can find out when his cousin will be 27 by setting up an equation.

Let x be the number of years that have passed since both Jame and his cousin were the same age. In 5 years, Jame will be 27, so x + 5 = 27. Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means that 5 years ago, his cousin was 22 years old.

Now we know that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. Let y be the age of his cousin in 8 years. We can set up the equation: y = 2(Jame's age in 8 years) - 5.

In 8 years, Jame will be 35 years old, so y = 2(35) - 5 = 65 - 5 = 60.

Therefore, the age difference between Jame and his cousin now is the difference between their ages 5 years ago, which was 22 for Jame and (22 - 5 =) 17 for his cousin.

Therefore, the cost of both monitors is:

$2,400 (total) - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

534," To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine how many seashells the boys brought in total. We know that each boy brought back 60 seashells, and there were 10 boys in the group.

Total seashells brought by boys = Seashells per boy * Number of boys
Total seashells brought by boys = 60 * 10
Total seashells brought by boys = 600

Now we know that the girls brought an equal amount to the boys, plus four times as many seashells. So we can set up an equation:

Girls' seashells = Boys' seashells + 4 * Boys' seashells

We can simplify this equation by combining the number of seashells the boys brought:

Girls' seashells = 5 * Boys' seashells

Now we can find out how many seashells each girl brought by dividing the total seashells the girls brought by the number of girls:

Total seashells brought by girls = Girls' seashells per girl * Number of girls
Total seashells brought by girls = 5 * Boys' seashells * Number of girls

Since there were an equal number of girls and boys, there were 10 girls in the group.

Total seashells brought by girls = 5 * Boys' seashells * 10
Total seashells brought by girls = 5 * 600 * 10
Total seashells brought by girls = 30,000

Now we can find out how many seashells each girl brought:

Seashells per girl = Total seashells brought by girls / Number of girls
Seashells per girl = 30,000 / 10
Seashells per girl = 3,000

541," To find out how much Elvis needs to save daily in the second half of April to reach his monthly saving target, we first need to determine how much he saves daily in the first half. We know that he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, so:

Daily saving in the second half = 2 * Daily saving in the first half

We also know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month, we can calculate his daily saving target by dividing his monthly target by the number of days in a month:

Daily saving target = Monthly saving target / Number of days in a month
Daily saving target = $1125 / 30.44
Daily saving target ≈ $36.93

Now we can find out how much Elvis saves daily in the first half of April by assuming that there are 15 days in the first half (since there are approximately 15.21 days in each half of the month):

Saving in the first half = Daily saving target * Number of days in the first half
Saving in the first half = $36.93 * 15
Saving in the first half ≈ $553.95

To save twice as much daily in the second half, Elvis needs to save:

Saving in the second half = 2 * Saving in the first half
Saving in the second half = 2 * $553.95
Saving in the second half ≈ $1107.91

Since there are approximately 15.21 days in each half of the month, there are around 7.6 days in the second half of April. We can find out how much Elvis needs to save daily in the second half by dividing his total saving target for the second half by the number of days in the second half:

Daily saving target in the second half = Total saving target in the second half / Number of days in the second half
Daily saving target in the second half ≈ $1107.91 / 7.6

In this case, one family initiates the call in the first round, and each family calls three others, so the number of families in each round is 3 times the number in the previous round.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 1 (since one family is notified in the first round), r = 3 (since each family calls three others), and n is the number of rounds we want to find.

To find the number of families notified during the fourth round, we need to find n:

n = log(1 - r^4 / (1 - r), base 1/r)

Using a calculator, we can find:

552," To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from selling goods worth $2500, we need to apply the given commission rates step by step.

First, we calculate the commission for selling $1000 worth of goods:
Commission for $1000 = Sales amount * Commission rate
Commission for $1000 = $1000 * 0.3
Commission for $1000 = $300

Next, we calculate the commission for selling the additional $1500 (from $2500 to $1000 difference):
Commission for additional $1500 = Additional sales amount * Additional commission rate
Commission for additional $1500 = $1500 * 0.1
Commission for additional $1500 = $150

Finally, we add both commission amounts to find the total amount Antonella earned:
Total commission = Commission for $1000 + Commission for additional $1500
Total commission = $300 + $150
Total commission = $450

So, Antonella earned a total of $\boxed{450}$ from selling goods worth $2500.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

554," To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we first need to determine how long it takes him to swim a mile on a hot day.

We know that on a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. On a warm day, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we can set up the equation:

16 minutes (cold day) = x minutes (warm day)
x = 2 * 16 + 2
x = 32 + 2
x = 34 minutes

Therefore, on a warm day, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we can multiply the time it takes to swim a mile by 3:

3 miles = 3 * 34 minutes
3 miles = 102 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, we can multiply the time it takes to swim a mile by 3:

3 miles = 3 * 16 minutes
3 miles = 48 minutes

Finally, we can find the difference between the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:

Difference = Time on hot day - Time on cold day
Difference = 102 minutes - 48 minutes
Difference = 54 minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes by multiplying the number of buttons with two holes by 2 (since each button with two holes has 2 holes) and the number of buttons with four holes by 4 (since each button with four holes has 4 holes):

Total holes = (Number of buttons with 2 holes) * (Holes per button with 2 holes) + (Number of buttons with 4 holes) * (Holes per button with 4 holes)

Angle moved by the sun = Angular speed * Time

Angular speed = 5 degrees per hour
Time = 10 hours

Angle moved by the sun = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Now, we can find the final angle between the ground and the sun:

Final angle = Initial angle + Angle moved by the sun

563," To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy for both sons, we first need to determine how many candles each son requires. Since the older son is 12 and the younger one is 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old. Let's assume they both want the same number of candles on their cakes.

Each son needs candles for a cake with (x) candles. So, the older son needs x candles, and the younger son needs x-4 candles (since he is 4 years younger). Since they both need the same number of candles, x must be a multiple of 4, and the difference between the number of candles for each son should be 4.

Let's find the smallest multiple of 4 that results in a number of candles that can be bought with whole packs. Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of candles for each son should be a multiple of 5 as well.

The smallest multiple of 4 and 5 is 20. So, each son needs 20 candles. James will need to buy 4 packs of candles to have enough candles for both sons.

The cost of one pack is $3, so the cost for James is:

564," To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we first need to determine how many minutes she spent reading in the second week. We know that she read 100 pages, and we're given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

First, let's calculate how long it takes her to read 100 pages:

Time = Number of pages * Time per page
Time = 100 pages * (1.5 minutes / 2 pages)
Time = 100 pages * (1.5 minutes / 2 pages) * (60 minutes / 1 hour)
Time = 100 pages * (1.5 minutes / 2 pages) * (60 minutes / 1 hour) * (1 hour / 24 hours) * (7 days * 24 hours / 1 week)

Now, let's calculate the total number of minutes she spent reading in the second week:

Minutes in the second week = Time * Number of days
Minutes in the second week = (100 pages * (1.5 minutes / 2 pages) * (60 minutes / 1 hour) * (1 hour / 24 hours) * (7 days * 24 hours / 1 week)) * 7 days
Minutes in the second week = (100 pages * 1.5 minutes / 3 pages) * 7 days * 1440 minutes / 7 days
Minutes in the second week = (100 pages * 1.5 minutes / 3 pages) * 1440 minutes
Minutes in the second week = (100 * 1.5) / 3 * 1440
Minutes in the second week = 200 * 1440 / 3
Minutes in the second week = 288000 / 3
Minutes in the second week ≈ 96,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, we can convert this value to hours:

Hours in the second week = Minutes in the second week / (Minutes per hour * Hours per day)
Hours in the second week = 96,000 minutes / (60 minutes / hour * 24 hours / day)
Hours in the second week = 96,000 minutes / (3,456 minutes / hour)
Hours in the second week ≈ 27,777.78 hours

Now that we know how many hours Judy spent reading in the second week, we can calculate how many pages she read during that time:

Pages in the second week = Hours in the second week * Pages per hour
Pages in the second week = 27,777.78 hours * 2 pages / hour
Pages in the second week = 55,555.56 pages

Since Judy can't read a fraction of a page, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

Pages in the second week = 55,556 pages

To find the total number of pages she read in both weeks, we add the number of pages she read in the first week (15 minutes * 7 nights * 2 pages / 1.5 minutes) to the number of pages she read in the second week:

Total pages = Pages in the first week + Pages in the second week
Total pages = (15 minutes * 7 nights * 2 pages / 1.5 minutes) + 55,556 pages
Total pages = (15 * 7 * 2 * 60 / 1.5) + 55,556
Total pages = (15 * 7 * 40) + 55,556
Total pages = 420 * 7 + 55,556
Total pages = 2,942.8 + 55,556
Total pages ≈ 57,494.8

Since Judy can't read a fraction of a page, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:

$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $1.00 * 3 (for the next three teeth) = $6.00

Now, let's calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for each of the last two teeth. We know that the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth:
- For each of the last two teeth, Sharon received half of $1.00 = $0.50.

So, the total amount of money Sharon received for all six teeth is:

Total number of roses required by all flower shops = Roses for shop 1 + Roses for shop 2 + Roses for shop 3

Total number of roses required by all flower shops = 20 roses + 15 roses + 30 roses = 65 roses

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, the number of roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every week is:

Roses Ford lacks per week = Total number of roses required - Roses grown by Ford
Roses Ford lacks per week = 65 roses - 40 roses = 25 roses

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to multiply the weekly deficit by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming an average month has 4 weeks:

Percentage Error = |-0.1023529411765| * 100%

Percentage Error = 10.23529411765%

Since the percentage error is positive, the oven is running hotter than the desired temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to reach 520 degrees, we can use the following formula:

Temperature Setting = Desired Temperature / (1 + Percentage Error)

Temperature Setting = 520 / (1 + 0.1023529411765)

Temperature Setting = 520 / 1.1023529411765

Temperature Setting ≈ 470.35 degrees

First, let's calculate 30% of Herb's house value:

$76,000 * 0.3 = \boxed{22,880}$

Now, we can find Juan's house value by subtracting the difference from Herb's house value:

$76,000 - 22,880 = \boxed{53,120}$

To find the combined value of both houses, we simply add their individual values:

1. From one box, Pete gets 90 contacts that last him 45 days. So, one contact lasts him 45 days / 90 contacts = 0.5 days per contact.
2. When Pete buys 2 boxes, he gets a total of 180 contacts (90 contacts per box * 2 boxes).
3. These contacts will last him 45 days per box * 2 boxes = 90 days in total.
4. Since one contact lasts 0.5 days, 180 contacts will last him 180 contacts * 0.5 days per contact = 90 days.
5. Now, we need to find out how much Pete pays for 2 boxes. The price of one box is $100.00, and there's a 10% discount. So, the discounted price of one box is $100.00 * (1 - 0.1) = $90.00.

587," To find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we first need to determine the number of red and blue jelly beans based on the given information.

Let R be the number of red jelly beans, B be the number of blue jelly beans, and G be the number of green jelly beans.

We know that:
1. R = 0.99B
2. G = 1.01B
3. R + B + G = 4500

Now we can solve this system of equations:

1. R = 0.99B
2. G = 1.01B
3. B + R + G = 4500

Substitute R from equation 1 into equation 3:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine the terms:

2.00B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2:

B = 2250

Now we can find R and G:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 2250 = 2196.25 ≈ 2196 (since we cannot have a fraction of a jelly bean)

G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 2250 = 2302.5 ≈ 2303 (similarly, we cannot have a fraction of a jelly bean)

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans:

589," To find the difference in Martin's weight after 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we first need to calculate how much weight he will gain or lose each week with each breakfast option.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week.
If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week.

Now, let's calculate the weight change after 5 weeks for each breakfast option:

1. Cheerios: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
2. Donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is the sum of the weight he would have lost with Cheerios minus the weight he would have gained with donuts.

The answer is: 6.25 pounds (lost with Cheerios) - 8.75 pounds (gained with donuts) = -2.5 pounds.

However, since Martin cannot lose weight that he doesn't have, the result is not valid. Instead, the correct answer would be the absolute value of the difference in weight gained:

The answer is: 6.5 pounds (gained with donuts) - 6.25 pounds (lost with Cheerios) = 0.25 pounds or 0.3 pounds.

So, Martin would gain approximately 0.3 pounds more by eating donuts every day for breakfast compared to eating Cheerios.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

593," To find out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to determine how long it takes for the beanstalk to reach a height of 20 feet (the height of the window plus the initial height of the beanstalk).

Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

Height = Initial height * (2 ^ Number of days)

We want to find the Number of days, so we can set up the equation as follows:

20 = 4 * (2 ^ Number of days)

To solve for Number of days, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

log2(5) + log2(Number of days) = log2(5000)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) = 3. We can simplify the equation as follows:

3 + log2(Number of days) = 13.966 (rounded log2(5000))

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

log2(Number of days) = 10.966

Taking the exponent of 2:

Number of days = 2 ^ 10.966

Using a calculator, we find that Number of days ≈ 1024.

So, it will take approximately 1024 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

First, let's calculate the number of washes Jackie gets from one pump:
1 pump = 120 washings / 2 pumps
1 pump = 120 washings * 0.5

614," To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we first need to determine how many gallons of water he uses for laundry in a week and then calculate the annual cost based on that.

Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, the amount of water Gary uses in a week is:

Water used in a week = Gallons per load * Number of loads per week
Water used in a week = 20 gallons * 2 loads
Water used in a week = 40 gallons

Now, we need to find out how much Gary spends on water for a week. We know that a gallon of water costs $0.15, so the cost of water for a week is:

Cost of water in a week = Water used in a week * Cost per gallon
Cost of water in a week = 40 gallons * $0.15/gallon
Cost of water in a week = $6

Finally, to find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to multiply the cost of water in a week by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:

Cost of water in a year = Cost of water in a week * Number of weeks in a year

623," To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her age in the future when she is 16 years old, and then subtract the number of years that will have passed between the present and that future point in time.

We know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. So, we can calculate her age 4 years after she turns 16 by adding 4 years to her age at that time:

Charmaine's age 4 years after turning 16 = Charmaine's age when she is 16 + 4 years

Now, let's find Charmaine's age when she is 16:

Charmaine's age when she is 16 = Current age + 12 years

Substitute the given information into the equation:

Charmaine's age when she is 16 = Current age + 12 years

Now, let's find Charmaine's age 4 years after turning 16:

Charmaine's age 4 years after turning 16 = Charmaine's age when she is 16 + 4 years

1. Convert kb per second to Mb per second:
   We know that 1 Mb = 1024 kb. So,
   1 Mb/s = 1024 kb/s
   Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second is:
   20 kb/s * (1 Mb/s / 1024 kb/s) = 0.01953125 Mb/s

2. Convert Mb per second to Mb per hour:
   We know that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So,
   1 Mb/s = 60 * 60 = 3600 Mb/s
   Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

627," To calculate the total number of cars towed in a week, we first need to find out how many cars were towed each day for the first three days and then for the remaining days.

For the first three days, the tow truck towed 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed during these days is:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining days of the week, the tow truck towed 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day during these days is:

10 cars/day - 4 cars = 6 cars

The total number of cars towed during these days is:

6 cars/day * number of remaining days = ?

To find the number of remaining days, we know that there are 7 days in a week, and the tow truck towed 30 cars during the first three days. So, the number of remaining days is:

7 days - 3 days = 4 days

Therefore, the total number of cars towed during the remaining days is:

628," To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert his current height and the minimum height requirement into the same unit. Since the height requirement is given in feet, we'll convert Adam's height from inches to feet.

1 inch = 12 inches / 1 foot

Adam's height in feet: 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet
Minimum height requirement: 4 feet = 48 inches / 12 inches/foot = 4 feet = 4.0 feet

Now, we'll calculate how many inches Adam needs to grow to meet the minimum height requirement:

Height difference = Minimum height requirement - Current height
Height difference = 4.0 feet * 12 inches/foot - 3.33 feet * 12 inches/foot
Height difference = 48 inches - 39.96 inches = 8.04 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we can calculate how many years it will take for him to grow that amount:

Years until tall enough = Height difference / Growth per year
Years until tall enough = 8.04 inches / 2 inches/year = 4.02 years

However, since Adam can't grow a fraction of a year, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

629," To find out how much James made, we first need to determine the total revenue he generated from selling the 10 cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000, the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Number of cars * Price per car
Total revenue = 10 cars * $25,000/car
Total revenue = $250,000

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid for the cars. Since they paid 30% of the selling price, we can calculate this as:

Company cost = Total revenue * 30%
Company cost = $250,000 * 0.3
Company cost = $75,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the company cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Company cost
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000
Profit = $175,000

Finally, we can calculate James' earnings by finding 10% of the profit:

James' earnings = Profit * Commission rate
James' earnings = $175,000 * 0.1
James' earnings = $17,500

So, James made a total of $17,500 from selling the 10 used cars.

We also know that there are 100 riders in total. To find the number of men who can stay upright, we can set up a proportion:

Number of men who can stay upright / Total number of riders = Percentage of men who can stay upright / 100%

Let x be the number of men who can stay upright. Then, we have:

x / 100 = 40%

631," Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as D. According to the problem, the price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel, so its price is 4D/5. The price of the silver jewel is D - $400.

The total price for all three jewels is the sum of their individual prices:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel

Substitute the expressions for the prices of the gold and silver jewels:

Total price = D + (4D/5) + (D - 400)

To find the common term D, we can first make the terms with D alone:

Total price = D + (4D/5) + (D - 400)
Total price = D + (4D/5) + D - 400

Combine like terms:

Total price = 2D + (4D/5) - 400

Now, we can solve for D by first getting rid of the fraction:

Total price = 2D + (8D/5) - 400
Total price = 2D * (5 + 8/5) - 400
Total price = 2D * (13/5) - 400

To find the value of D, we need to isolate it:

2D * (13/5) - 400 = Total price
2D = (Total price + 400) * (5/13)

Now, we can find the price of the diamond jewel:

D = 2D * (5/13)
D = (2 * 5) / 13
D = 10 / 13 * Total price

Now that we have the price of the diamond jewel, we can find the prices of the gold and silver jewels:

Price of gold jewel = 4D/5 = 4 * (10 / 13) * Total price = 40 / 13 * Total price
Price of silver jewel = D - 400 = (10 / 13) * Total price - 400

Finally, we can find the total price for all three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = (10 / 13) * Total price + (40 / 13) * Total price + [(10 / 13) * Total price - 400]

Combine like terms:

Total price = (1 + 40 / 13 + 10 / 13) * Total price - 400
Total price = (1 + 50 / 13) * Total price - 400

Now, we can solve for Total price:

Total price = (13 + 50) / 13 * Total price - 400
Total price = 63 / 13 * Total price - 400

To find Total price, we need to isolate it:

63 / 13 * Total price - 400 = Total price
63 / 13 * Total price = 400 + Total price

Multiply both sides by 13/63:

(63 / 13) * (Total price * 1) = (400 + Total price) * (13 / 63)

Simplify:

Total price = (400 * 13 + 13 * Total price) / 63

3. He bought R rose stamps, which is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps. So, R = T - 9.

Now we have a system of equations:

S = 16
T = S + 3
R = T - 9

Substitute the first equation into the second and third equations:

T = 16 + 3 = 19

Now, we want to know how many classes Manny can miss while keeping the cost below $10 per class. Let x be the number of classes Manny misses. The total cost for the remaining classes he attends will be $60 - ($6x), where $6 is the cost of each class he attends.

We want the cost per class to be less than or equal to $10, so we set up the inequality:

$6 ≤ $10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss, we need to find the value of x that makes the cost per class equal to $10. We can do this by setting up the equation:

$6 = $10 - ($6x)

Solving for x:

$4 = $4x
x = 1

However, since Manny can miss one class without exceeding the $10 per class limit, our answer should be the number of classes he can miss without attending, which is one less than the result we found:

New monthly salary = Current monthly salary + (Current monthly salary * Raise percentage)
New monthly salary = $20000 + ($20000 * 0.05)
New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000
New monthly salary = $21000

Next, we need to find out the amount of his half-monthly bonus:

Half-monthly bonus = Current monthly salary / 2
Half-monthly bonus = $20000 / 2

646," To find the total number of miles biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we first need to calculate the distance each of them covered individually.

Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so her total distance covered is:

Distance_Alisa = Speed_Alisa * Time_Alisa
Distance_Alisa = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance_Alisa = 54 miles

Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so his total distance covered is:

Distance_Stanley = Speed_Stanley * Time_Stanley
Distance_Stanley = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance_Stanley = 25 miles

Now, to find the total distance covered by both Alisa and Stanley, we simply add their individual distances:

Total_Distance = Distance_Alisa + Distance_Stanley
Total_Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total_Distance = 79 miles

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at a cost of $30 each, but she got a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the discounted price for 20 pomegranates was $30 x 20 = $600, and a 10% discount on that amount would be $600 x 0.1 = $60. Therefore, Sheila paid $540 for the 20 pomegranates on Wednesday.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $398 (Clara's price) - $540 (Sheila's price) = -$142.

652," To find out how much James paid for the carriage ride, we need to determine how many hours he used the carriage beyond the first free hour. Let's calculate the number of paid hours:

1. The free hour is from 5 PM to 6 PM.
2. James paid for the hour from 6 PM to X (the last hour before 9 PM).

First, let's find out how many hours James paid for:

1. The first hour costs $15.
2. Each hour after that costs twice the cost of the first hour.
3. So, the cost of the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
4. To find the number of paid hours, we need to determine how many hours have a cost of $15 + $30 = $45.
5. We know that the last hour is before 9 PM, so let's find the hour that costs $45:
   - The hour from 6 PM to X has a cost of $15 + ($15 * 2^n), where n is the number of hours after the first hour.
   - We want to find the smallest integer value of n such that $15 + ($15 * 2^n) = $45.

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. $15 + ($15 * 2^n) = $45
2. $15 + $15 * 2^n = $30 * 2 + $15
3. $15 + $15 * 2^n = $60 + $15
4. $15 * 2^n = $45
5. 2^n = 3
6. n = log2(3) = 1 (since 2^1 = 2, and 2 * $15 = $30, which is the cost of the second hour)

So, James paid for 2 hours in total: the first hour for free and the second hour for $30.

Therefore, the final result is:

First, let's calculate how much money Sally should have had in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage of $300:

Bank account after receiving full wage = Starting balance + Weekly wage
Bank account after receiving full wage = $200 + $300
Bank account after receiving full wage = $500

However, Sally's bank account now holds $420. So, the difference between the amount she should have had and the amount she actually has is the amount that was withheld from her wage:

654," To find out how many eggs Lori will need for her party, we first need to determine how many deviled egg halves she will need in total. We know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, so Lori will need 1 whole egg for every 2 deviled egg halves.

Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, so the total number of deviled egg halves needed for all guests is:

Total deviled egg halves = Number of guests * Deviled egg halves per guest
= 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves
= 48 deviled egg halves

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs Lori will need is:

Total whole eggs = Total deviled egg halves / 2
= 48 deviled egg halves / 2
= 24 whole eggs

Finally, we need to convert the number of whole eggs from units of individual eggs to units of dozens. We know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, so:

Total dozens of eggs = Total whole eggs / Eggs per dozen
= 24 whole eggs / 12 eggs
= 2 dozens

657," To calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of buying the plane, the monthly cost of renting the hanger, and the monthly cost of fuel.

First, let's find the total cost of fuel for one year. We know that James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger, so:

Cost of fuel per month = $5000 * 2 = $10,000

To find the total cost of fuel for one year, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12):

Total cost of fuel for one year = $10,000 * 12 = $120,000

Now, let's add the initial cost of buying the plane to the total cost of fuel for the first year:

Total cost for the first year = $150,000 (initial cost) + $120,000 (fuel) = $270,000

2. It took her 20 minutes more to cook pork than rice (P = R + 20).
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice (B = (P + R) / 2).

Now we can find the cooking time for pork and beans:

P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes
B = (50 + 30) / 2 = (80) / 2 = 40 minutes

So, the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans are 30 minutes, 50 minutes, and 40 minutes, respectively. The total cooking time for all the food is the sum of these times:

659," To find the cost difference between two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts, we first need to determine the cost of each mixture.

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds = $10/pound * 1/2 pound = $\frac{5}{2}$ dollars
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = $15/pound * 1/3 pound = $\frac{5}{2}$ dollars (simplified)

Total cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts = $\frac{5}{2}$ + $\frac{5}{2}$ = $\boxed{\frac{10}{2} = 5}$ dollars

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds = $10/pound * 1/5 pound = $\frac{2}{3}$ dollars
Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts = $15/pound * 1/3 pound = $\frac{5}{2}$ dollars (simplified)

Total cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts = $\frac{2}{3}$ + $\frac{5}{2}$ = $\frac{13}{6}$ dollars

Now, let's find the cost difference:

Cost difference = Cost of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts - Cost of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts
Cost difference = 5 dollars - $\frac{13}{6}$ dollars

To find the difference, we can either subtract the fractions or convert both to the same denominator and then subtract:

Cost difference = 5 * $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{6}$
Cost difference = $\frac{10}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{6}$
Cost difference = $\frac{10}{3}$ * $\frac{2}{6}$ - $\frac{13}{6}$ * $\frac{1}{3}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{18}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{18}$ * $\frac{3}{3}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{18}$ * $\frac{1}{1}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{18}$ * $\frac{1}{1}$ * $\frac{2}{2}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{18}$ * $\frac{2}{2}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{36}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{1}{3}$ * $\frac{13}{3}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{9}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{1}{3}$ * $\frac{13}{3}$ * $\frac{1}{1}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{9}$ * $\frac{1}{1}$
Cost difference = $\frac{2}{3}$ - $\frac{13}{9}$

So, the cost difference is $\frac{1}{3}$ less than a pound of almonds, which is $\frac{2}{3}$ pounds. Therefore, the cost difference is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}}$ pound or $\boxed{\frac{1}{3} * 15 = 5}$ dollars.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}

Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We have two equations based on the given information:

1) S + G = 70 (total number of legs)
2) S + G = 20 (total number of heads)

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can rewrite the first equation as:

S + G = 70
4S + 2G = 70 * 2
4S + 2G = 140

Now, let's subtract the second equation (S + G = 20) from the first equation:

(4S + 2G) - (S + G) = 140 - 20
3S + G = 120

To solve this equation, we need to find integer values for S and G that satisfy it. We can start by finding possible values for S and then check if there is a corresponding value for G that makes the equation true.

Since each sheep has 4 legs, the minimum number of sheep we can have is 1 (1 * 4 = 4). Let's try this value for S and find the corresponding value for G:

3S + G = 120
3(1) + G = 120
G = 119

However, this value for G is not valid since we cannot have 119 geese on the farm. Let's try the next possible value for S, which is 2:

3S + G = 120
3(2) + G = 120
G = 116

Again, this value for G is not valid since we cannot have 116 geese on the farm. Let's continue trying values for S until we find a valid solution:

S = 3: G = 114
S = 4: G = 110
S = 5: G = 105

671," To find the change Adam received, we first need to determine how much he spent on the candies. We know he bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, so the cost of 7 candies of type A is:

Cost of candies of type A = Number of candies * Cost per candy
Cost of candies of type A = 7 * $0.5
Cost of candies of type A = $3.5

Similarly, the cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, so the cost of 10 candies of type B is:

Cost of candies of type B = Number of candies * Cost per candy
Cost of candies of type B = 10 * $0.75
Cost of candies of type B = $7.5

The total cost of the candies is the sum of the cost of candies of type A and the cost of candies of type B:

Total cost of candies = Cost of candies of type A + Cost of candies of type B
Total cost of candies = $3.5 + $7.5
Total cost of candies = $11

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received is:

So, he needed to buy toys for these 16 dogs, which would require an additional 16 toys.

However, he no longer needed the toys for the 3 dogs that had been taken from the shelter. Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he had initially, the toys he bought for the new dogs, and the toys he no longer needs for the dogs that were taken away.

Dylan's investment = 2/5 * X

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, so her investment was:

Frances' investment = 2/3 * (X - Dylan's investment)

Since we know Dylan's investment was 2/5 of the total amount, we can find the remaining amount for Frances' investment:

Remaining amount = X - Dylan's investment
                 = X - (2/5 * X)
                 = X(1 - 2/5)

Now, we can find Frances' investment:

Frances' investment = 2/3 * (X - Dylan's investment)
                   = 2/3 * X(3/5)
                   = 2/3 * X(1.5)

We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write this relationship as X = Y + 7.

Since there are three triplets, we can assume that their ages are equal. Let's denote the age of each triplet as A. Then, the total age of the triplets is 3A.

The total age of the twins is X + Y. Since the total age of all 4 people is 44, we can write the equation: X + Y + 3A = 44.

Now, we have two variables (X and Y) and one equation. To solve this system of equations, we need to find a relationship between X and Y or simplify the equation.

Since we know that X = Y + 7, we can substitute Y with (X - 7) in the equation: X + (X - 7) + 3A = 44.

Now, Manolo bought 5 lollipops for $0.40 each, so the total cost for the lollipops was 5 * 0.40 = 2.00.

Since Manolo bought 8 candies for $3.20, the cost for one candy is 3.20 / 8 = $0.40. So Manolo paid the right amount for the candies, and they were not included in the cost of the lollipops.

To find the cost for 10 lollipops, we can multiply the cost for 5 lollipops by 2: 2.00 * 2 = 4.00.

To find the cost for 10 candies, we know that each candy costs $0.40, so the cost for 10 candies would be 10 * 0.40 = 4.00.

702," To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than that. So, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Next, we know that the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks combined is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. And since Gary's truck, along with the other two, can haul a total of 11,600 pounds, the capacity of Gary's truck must be 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Result: Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
703," To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we first need to determine the total number of dumplings required for all the females and males, given that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers.

Let's denote the number of dumplings for females as F and for males as M. We know that there are 6 females and 8 males, so:

F = Number of dumplings for females
M = Number of dumplings for males

From the problem statement, we also know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Therefore, the number of dumplings for males is one more than the number of dumplings for females:

M = F + 1

We also know that there were no leftovers, so the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings for females and males:

Total dumplings = F + M

Now, we can substitute M = F + 1 into the equation for the total number of dumplings:

Total dumplings = F + (F + 1)

Combining the terms, we get:

Total dumplings = 2F + 1

Since we know that each female ate 3 dumplings, we can find the number of dumplings for all females by multiplying the number of females by the number of dumplings each female ate:

F = Number of females * Dumplings per female
F = 6 * 3
F = 18

Now, we can find the total number of dumplings by substituting F = 18 into the equation:

Total dumplings = 2F + 1
Total dumplings = 2(18) + 1
Total dumplings = 36 + 1
Total dumplings = 37

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 37 dumplings for his group of friends.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
704," To find out how much money Gerald had left after spending $10 on a book, we first need to determine how much money they both had initially based on the given ratio of 3:2.

Let's denote the amount of money Gerald had as $3x$ and the amount of money Julia had as $2x$. The sum of their amounts should equal $100$:

$$3x + 2x = 100$$

Combining the terms, we get:

$$5x = 100$$

Now, we can find the value of $x$:

$$x = \frac{100}{5} = 20$$

So, Gerald had $3x = 3 \times 20 = \boxed{60}$ initially, and after spending $10 on a book, he had:

$$60 - 10 = \boxed{50}$$

Therefore, Gerald had $\boxed{50}$ left after spending $10 on a book.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
705," To find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine its speed in feet per second. We know that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second.

Let's denote the turtle's speed as x feet/second. Then, the cat's speed is 5x feet/second. We have the equation:

5x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 15 / 5
x = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate how far it can crawl in 40 seconds:

Feet crawled by the turtle = Speed * Time
                                       = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
                                       = 120 feet

So, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
706," To find out for how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise in total to reach their goal, we first need to determine how many hours it takes to raise $4200 (the difference between their goal and what they have already raised).

We know that they have raised $2100 in 3 hours. So, the rate at which they are raising funds is $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour.

To find out how many hours it takes to raise the remaining $4200, we can use the following formula:

\boxed{\text{Number of hours} = \frac{\text{Amount to be raised}}{\text{Rate of fundraising}}}

\text{Number of hours} = \frac{$4200}{$700}

\text{Number of hours} \approx 6.03 hours

Since they cannot fundraise for a fraction of an hour, they will need to fundraise for at least 7 hours in total to reach their goal.

Therefore, the final result is:

707," First, we need to find out how much water Colorado City uses for industrial purposes. We know that the city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes. So, we can calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes as follows:

Water used for industrial purposes = Total water used by Colorado City * Percentage of water used for industry

Water used for industrial purposes = 40% * Total water from Colorado River

Next, we need to find out how much water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes. Since we know that 80% of the water is used for industry, the remaining 20% must be used for non-industrial purposes. So, we can calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes as follows:

Water used for non-industrial purposes = Total water used by Colorado City * Percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes

Water used for non-industrial purposes = 20% * Total water from Colorado River

Now, we can find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes by dividing the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes by the total water from the Colorado River and multiplying by 100:

Percentage of river's water used for non-industrial purposes = (Water used for non-industrial purposes / Total water from Colorado River) * 100%

Result: \frac{20\%}{100\%} * \frac{Total\ Water\ from\ Colorado\ River}{100\%} * 100\% = 20\% * \frac{Total\ Water\ from\ Colorado\ River}{1000\%}

712," To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we first need to calculate how many pieces of candy each person has eaten during that time.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

Ginger's candy consumption = Daily candy consumption * Number of days
Ginger's candy consumption = 4 pieces * 14 days
Ginger's candy consumption = 56 pieces

So, Ginger will have eaten 56 pieces of candy in two weeks.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

Amy's candy consumption = Daily candy consumption * Number of days
Amy's candy consumption = 3 pieces * 14 days
Amy's candy consumption = 42 pieces

So, Amy will have eaten 42 pieces of candy in two weeks.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract the number of pieces of candy Ginger has eaten from the number of pieces of candy Amy has eaten:

Difference in candy = Amy's candy consumption - Ginger's candy consumption
Difference in candy = 42 pieces - 56 pieces
Difference in candy = -14 pieces

However, since we cannot have a negative number of pieces of candy, this means that Ginger actually has more candy than Amy after two weeks.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, we can calculate the number of tiles required by multiplying the area in square feet by the number of tiles per square foot:

22.67 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 544.08 tiles

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a tile, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need approximately 545 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom.

715," The company initially planned to buy 500 computers at a price of $700 per computer. However, they discovered that the new price of each computer was 10% higher than their initial budget. To find the new price of each computer, we need to add 10% of the initial price to it.

New price of one computer = Initial price + (Initial price * 10%)
New price of one computer = $700 + ($700 * 0.1)
New price of one computer = $700 + $70
New price of one computer = $770

Now that we know the new price of each computer, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid for all 500 computers.

Total amount paid = Number of computers * New price per computer

Bryce had 12 slices, and he ate 2/3 of it, so he ate 12 * (2/3) = 8 slices.
Two of his friends each had 12 slices, and they ate 2/3 of each pizza, so they ate 12 * 2 * (2/3) = 16 slices in total.

So, Bryce and his two friends ate a total of 8 (Bryce's) + 16 (two friends') = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends each had 12 slices, and they ate ¾ of each pizza, so they ate 12 * 2 * (3/4) = 9 slices in total.

So, the two remaining friends ate 9 slices.

In total, they consumed 24 (Bryce and two friends) + 9 (two remaining friends) = 33 slices.

Since each pizza had 12 slices, and they ordered 5 pizzas, there were initially 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

For the cat, we know that it takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages.

For the dog, we're told that it can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. So, we can calculate the time it takes the dog to eat nine sausages as follows:

Time for dog = Time for cat * (2/3)
Time for dog = 30 minutes * (2/3)
Time for dog = 30 minutes * (2/3) * 60 minutes/hour
Time for dog = 40 minutes

Now that we have the time it takes each animal to eat nine sausages, we can calculate the average time by adding their times together and dividing by the number of animals (in this case, 2):

Average time = (Time for cat + Time for dog) / Number of animals
Average time = (30 minutes + 40 minutes) / 2
Average time = 70 minutes / 2

Next, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes for the teachers' cars:
1. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
2. So, the total number of windows for teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Now, we know that Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. Let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes for each type of car:

1. For students' cars, she smashes a quarter of the total number of windows, which is 256 * 1/4 = 64 windows.
2. For teachers' cars, she smashes 3/4ths of the total number of windows, which is 64 * 3/4 = 96 windows.

At 8:00, 5000 people were in line to vote. Let's call this the total number of voters, V.

By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:

Voted by midday = Total number of voters * (2/5)

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. Let's call the number of people who had not voted by midday R.

Total number of voters - Voted by midday = R
5000 - 4000 = 1000

By 16:00, 2/3 of R had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 is:

Voted by 16:00 = R * (2/3)

To find R, we can set up an equation and solve for it:

R = 5000 - 4000
R = 1000

Voted by 16:00 = R * (2/3)
= 1000 * (2/3)
= 6666.67 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

731," To determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we first need to figure out how many smores will be made in total.

Each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores. So, 3 sleeves make the base for 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 smores.

9 kids will eat 2 smores each, so they will need 9 * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 smores.
6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so they will need 6 smores.

In total, they will need 18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = <<18+6=24>>24 smores.

Since 24 smores can be made with 3 sleeves of graham crackers, they will need to buy 24 smores / 24 smores per box = <<24/24=1>>1 box of graham crackers.

732," To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we first need to find the ages of Dora's father and mother using the given information.

1. We know that Dora's father is eight years older than twice Dora's age. So, we can write the equation: Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
2. We also know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can write the equation for Mother's age: Mother's age = Father's age - 4
3. Since Dora's age is given as 15, we can substitute it into the equations to find the ages of her father and mother.

Let's calculate:
1. Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8 = 32 + 8 = 40
2. Mother's age = Father's age - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age by adding their ages together:

First, let's find the weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each book weighs 2 pounds, the weight of both books is:

2 pounds/book * 2 books = 4 pounds

Next, let's find the weight of Cindy's French book, which weighs 4 pounds.

The weight of Cindy's English book is 3 pounds.

The weight of Cindy's history book is twice as much as her English book, so it weighs:

3 pounds * 2 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all of Cindy's books:

735," To find out how many votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. We know that candidate A received 20% of the votes, so candidate B received 50% more than that.

Let's represent the number of votes for candidate A as ""x"". Then, the number of votes for candidate B would be ""x + 0.5x = 1.5x"".

Since there were 100 voters in total, we can set up the equation: x + 1.5x + votes_for_candidate_C = 100

Combining the terms with x, we get 2.5x + votes_for_candidate_C = 100

To find the number of votes for candidate C, we need to subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

votes_for_candidate_C = 100 - (x + 1.5x)
votes_for_candidate_C = 100 - 2.5x

Now, we can solve for x by finding 20% of the total votes:

x = 0.2 * 100 = 20

Substituting x back into the equation for votes_for_candidate_C:

votes_for_candidate_C = 100 - (20 + 1.5 * 20)
votes_for_candidate_C = 100 - (20 + 30)

737," To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the given number of ice cubes, we first need to calculate the total amount of water used to make each type of ice cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces of water.

1. Giant cubes: 4 ounces per cube, Peter makes 3 cubes, so 4 * 3 = 12 ounces of water used.
2. Medium cubes: 2 ounces per cube, Peter makes 7 cubes, so 2 * 7 = 14 ounces of water used.
3. Small cubes: 1/2 ounce per cube, Peter makes 8 cubes, so 1/2 * 8 = 4 ounces of water used.

Now, let's find the total amount of water used: 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 28 ounces.

Finally, to find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount: 32 ounces (initial water) - 28 ounces (used water) = 4 ounces.

Let's denote the number of books Alice has as A and the number of books Steven has as S. From the problem statement, we have:

S = A - 6
Clara's number of books = 2 * S = 2 * (A - 6)

We're given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:

2 * (A - 6) = 20

Now, let's solve for A:

A - 6 = 10
A = 16

Since we know that Alice has 16 books and Steven has A - 6 = 10 books, the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice is:

Clara's number of books - Alice's number of books = 20 - 16 = 4

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

740," To find out how many students like to play video games, we first need to determine how many students like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. So, we have:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * Number of students who like to play basketball

We also know that there are 10 students who like to bake, 5 who like to play basketball, and the rest who like to play video games or music. The total number of students is 50, so:

Total number of students = Students who bake + Students who play basketball + Students who play video games + Students who play music

We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

50 = 10 + 5 + Students who play video games + Students who play music

Now, we can substitute the expression for the number of students who like to play music:

50 = 10 + 5 + Students who play video games + 2 * Number of students who like to play basketball

To solve for the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to find the number of students who like to play basketball. Let's call this number x:

50 = 10 + 5 + Students who play video games + 2 * x

We don't have enough information to find the exact number of students who like to play video games, but we can find the relationship between the number of students who like to play basketball and the number of students who like to play video games.

Subtracting 10 and 5 from both sides of the equation:

35 = Students who play video games + 2 * x

To find the number of students who like to play video games in terms of the number of students who like to play basketball, we can solve for ""Students who play video games"" by moving all the terms to one side of the equation:

Students who play video games = 35 - 2 * x

Since we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we can represent the number of students who like to play music as 2x. The total number of students is 50, so:

50 = 10 + 5 + Students who play video games + 2 * x

Substituting the expression for the number of students who like to play music:

50 = 10 + 5 + Students who play video games + 2 * (2 * x)

Simplifying:

50 = 10 + 5 + Students who play video games + 4 * x

Now, we can write the equation in terms of ""Students who play video games"":

Students who play video games = 35 - 4 * x

Since we don't have enough information to find the exact value of x (the number of students who like to play basketball), we can't find the exact number of students who like to play video games. However, we can express the relationship between the number of students who like to play basketball and the number of students who like to play video games.

First, let's calculate the number of students in one class:
Number of students in one class = Total number of students / 2
Number of students in one class = 80 / 2
Number of students in one class = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so we can calculate the number of girls in one class:
Number of girls in one class = Number of students in one class * Percentage of girls
Number of girls in one class = 40 * 0.4
Number of girls in one class = 16

Since there are 40 students in total in one class and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in one class must be:
Number of boys in one class = Number of students in one class - Number of girls in one class
Number of boys in one class = 40 - 16
Number of boys in one class = 24

Total animals = 28

Now, we want to split these animals evenly over the seven days of the week. So, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

Animals per day = Total animals / Days per week
Animals per day = 28 / 7

Since we cannot have a fraction of an animal, we need to round up or down. In this case, rounding down would mean leaving some animals ungroomed, which is not an option for Melissa. So, we round up:

749," To find out how many more groups are needed to form when there are 54 students who need to be separated into 12 groups instead of 6, we first need to determine how many students should be in each group for 12 groups.

Since there are 54 students and we want to divide them into 12 equal groups, we can calculate the size of each group by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

Group size = Total students / Number of groups
Group size = 54 students / 12 groups
Group size = 4.5 students per group

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to ensure that all students are included in a group. Therefore, each group should have 5 students.

Now, we can calculate how many students there would be in 12 groups of 5 students each:

Total students in 12 groups = Group size * Number of groups
Total students in 12 groups = 5 students/group * 12 groups
Total students in 12 groups = 60 students

Since there are currently only 54 students, we need to find the difference between the required number of students (60) and the actual number of students (54):

Additional groups needed = (Required total students - Actual total students) / Group size
Additional groups needed = (60 students - 54 students) / 5 students/group

We know that:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the number of chairs rented during one week is:
Chairs rented in one week = Chairs rented in weekdays * Number of weekdays + Chairs rented in weekends * Number of weekend days

Now, since there are 4 weeks in a month, the number of chairs rented out in one month is:
Chairs rented in one month = Chairs rented in one week * Number of weeks in a month

30 * 0.9 = 27 small stickers traded

Now, we need to find out how many large buttons she gets in return. Each small sticker is worth one small button, so Lorraine gets 27 small buttons. Since one large button is worth three small buttons, she gets:

27 * 3 = 81 large buttons

Next, let's find out how many large stickers Lorraine trades. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

40 * 0.5 = 20 large stickers traded

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, Lorraine gets:

20 * 3 = 60 large buttons

However, she already has 81 large buttons from trading small stickers. So, she has a total of:

81 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 141 large buttons

Since one large button is worth three small buttons, we can also find the number of small buttons by dividing the number of large buttons by three:

141 / 3 = 47 small buttons (approximately)

So, Lorraine has approximately 47 small buttons left and 141 large buttons by the end.

We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as x. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is 2/3 * x.

One-third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. We know that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, the number of Pomeranian girls is 1/3 * (number of Pomeranian puppies).

Setting up an equation, we have:

1/3 * (number of Pomeranian puppies) = 6

To find the number of Pomeranian puppies, we can cross-multiply:

number of Pomeranian puppies = 3 * 6 = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranian puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by using the given information that two-thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians:

total number of puppies = 18 (Pomeranian puppies) * (2/3) = 27

763," To find out how many cases of shingles the third house needs, we first need to determine how many cases the second house requires, and then calculate the number of cases for the third house based on that information.

We know that:
1. The three houses together will need 250 cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half as many cases as the second house.
3. The third house needs double the number of cases that the first house requires.

Let's denote the number of cases for the second house as x. According to the problem statement, the first house will need half as many cases, so it will require x/2 cases. The third house will need double the number of cases that the first house requires, so it will need 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases for all three houses is 250, we can set up the following equation:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To solve this equation, we can first find the common denominator, which is 2. We can then rewrite the equation as:

2x + x + 2x = 500
5x = 500
x = 100

So, the second house will need 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the number of cases that the first house requires, the third house will need 2 * (1/2 * 100) = 100 cases.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

We know that Bananas = 200, so we can solve for x:

x + 0.45x = 200
1.45x = 200
x = 137.65 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a fruit, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 138.

So, George has 138 pears.

771," To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to determine how many eggplants he sold in total and how much money he made from selling them. We know that he sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:

Total money from eggplants = Number of eggplants * Price per eggplant
Total money from eggplants = 20 * $3
Total money from eggplants = $60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135 from selling both his eggplants and ears of corn. We've already found that he made $60 from selling the eggplants, so we need to find out how much money he will make from selling the ears of corn:

Total money from corn = Total money needed - Total money from eggplants
Total money from corn = $135 - $60
Total money from corn = $75

To find out how many ears of corn Bennet needs to sell to make $75, we can divide the total money needed from corn by the price per ear of corn (which we don't know yet):

Number of ears of corn = Total money from corn / Price per ear of corn

We want to solve for the price per ear of corn, so we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:

Price per ear of corn = Total money from corn / Number of ears of corn

We know that Bennet has 25 ears of corn, so we can plug that value into the equation and solve for the price per ear of corn:

Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25
Price per ear of corn = $3

However, we made an error in our calculation. We mistakenly assumed that Bennet made $60 from selling the eggplants, but in fact, he made $3 * 20 = $60. Therefore, the total money he needs to make is $135 - $60 = $75.

So, the correct calculation is:

Number of ears of corn = Total money from corn / Price per ear of corn
25 = $75 / Price per ear of corn
Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25
Price per ear of corn = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to make a total of $135.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
772," To find out how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine how many hours she has left after accounting for reading and video games.

Let's call the number of hours Tatiana spends playing soccer ""x.""

We know that she spends 3 hours reading and 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games. So, the total time she spends on activities other than soccer is:

3 hours (reading) + (1/3) * (remaining hours)

Since we want to find the remaining hours for soccer, we need to subtract the time spent on reading and video games from her total weekend hours:

Total weekend hours = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Now, let's set up an equation to find the number of hours Tatiana spends playing soccer:

Total weekend hours = 3 hours (reading) + (1/3) * (remaining hours) + x

We know that the remaining hours for soccer is ""x,"" so we can rewrite the equation as:

12 hours = 3 hours + (1/3) * x + x

To solve for x, we first need to isolate the term with x:

9 hours = (1/3) * x + x

Now, we can use the distributive property to combine the terms with x:

9 hours = x + (1/3) * x

Next, we can subtract (1/3) * x from both sides to isolate x:

8 hours = (2/3) * x

Now, we can divide both sides by (2/3) to find the value of x:

x = 8 hours / (2/3)

x = 12 hours / 1

x = 12 hours

So, Tatiana spends 12 hours playing soccer over the weekend. To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we can divide the number of hours she spends playing soccer by the total number of hours in her weekend and multiply by 100:

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (12 hours / 12 hours total) * 100%

Pencils given to Brandon = 25

Now, let's find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie. He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils:

Let x be the number of pencils Anthony had left after giving some to Brandon.

Pencils given to Charlie = x * (3/5)

We know that Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, so we can find x:

x = 50 - 25
x = 25

Now we can find the number of pencils Anthony gave to Charlie:

Pencils given to Charlie = 25 * (3/5)
Pencils given to Charlie = 15

So, Anthony kept:

Next, let's calculate the cost of movies that are not in series. Forty percent of the 400 movies are older movies, so there are 400 * 0.4 = <<400*0.4=160>>160 older movies. The cost of each older movie is $5, so the cost of older movies is 160 * $5 = $<<160*5=800>>800.

The cost of movies that are not in series and are not older is 400 - 160 = 240 movies. The cost of each normal movie is $10, so the cost of these movies is 240 * $10 = $<<240*10=2400>>2400.

The cost of movies in series is 200 * ($10 - $6) = 200 * $4 = $<<200*4=800>>800.

First, let's find the time they spent driving:
Total time = Driving time + Hiking time

We know that they drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total time - 1.5 hours hiking time), and their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they covered by driving is:

Driving distance = Driving time * Driving speed
Driving distance = 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour
Driving distance = 225 miles

Next, let's find the distance they covered by hiking. We know their average hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, so:

Hiking speed = 50 miles/hour * 0.5 - 5 miles/hour
Hiking speed = 24.5 miles/hour

Now, we can find the distance they covered by hiking:

Hiking distance = Hiking time * Hiking speed
Hiking distance = 1.5 hours * 24.5 miles/hour
Hiking distance = 36.75 miles

Finally, we can find the total distance to their vacation spot by adding the driving distance and hiking distance:

795," To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans with a $50.00 bill, we first need to determine the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans was $40, and they were advertised as being 25% off. To find the discounted price, we can calculate 25% of $40 and then subtract that amount from the original price.

First, let's calculate 25% of $40:

Discount = 0.25 * $40
Discount = 0.25 * $40.00
Discount = $10.00

Now that we know the discount is $10.00, we can find the discounted price by subtracting the discount from the original price:

Discounted price = Original price - Discount
Discounted price = $40 - $10
Discounted price = $30

So, the discounted price of the jeans is $30. Since Mike paid with a $50.00 bill, we can find the amount of money he has left over by subtracting the discounted price from the amount he paid:

Money left over = $50 - $30
Money left over = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after buying the jeans with a $50.00 bill.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
796," To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we first need to find out how many employees the company has after three months and then multiply that number by the monthly salary.

We know that the company hires 20 new employees every month, and the initial number of employees is 200. So after three months, the number of employees would be:

Employees after 3 months = Initial employees + (Hires per month * Number of months)
Employees after 3 months = 200 + (20 * 3)
Employees after 3 months = 200 + 60
Employees after 3 months = 260

Now that we have the number of employees after three months, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees:

Each half-hour session is 0.5 hours long, so Kris has played 7 * 0.5 = <<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5 hours in 2 weeks.

Next, let's find out how many hours she plays in a week when she plays for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours in a week.

Therefore, in 1 week, she plays for 14 hours. Since she has already played for 3.5 hours in 2 weeks, she has played a total of 3.5 + 14 = <<3.5+14=17.5>>17.5 hours.

806," To find the school's overall pass rate, we first need to determine the number of fifth-graders who passed the test. Since the pass rate for fifth graders was twice that of fourth graders, we can set up a proportion:

Passed fourth graders / Total fourth graders = Passed fifth graders / Total fifth graders

40 / 100 = x / 400

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2 * 40 * (100 / 100)
x = 80 * 1
x = 80

So, 80 fifth-graders passed the test.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate by finding the percentage of students who passed across all three grades:

Total students who passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 80 (fifth graders) = 460

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students) * 100%

Total students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

We know that each bag contains 72 chips, and it takes 12 chips to cover one square inch. So, the number of square inches covered by two bags is:

\boxed{2 \times \frac{72}{12}}

Now, we know that Milo's mosaic is three inches tall, so to find its length, we need to find the ratio of the height to the width and then calculate the length:

\frac{height}{width} = \frac{3 \ inches}{x \ inches}

Solving for x:

x = \frac{3 \ inches}{height/width}

Since Milo's mosaic is a rectangle, its area (square inches) is equal to the product of its length and width. We know the area covered by two bags of glass chips, so we can set up the equation:

area = (3 inches) * (x inches) = 2 * (\frac{72}{12})

Solving for x:

x = \frac{2 * 72}{12 * 3}

The bag initially had 35 marshmallows, so we need to find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:

Marshmallows left = Initial marshmallows - Marshmallows used
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each kid can make one S'more with one marshmallow, we can divide the number of marshmallows left by 2 (one for each kid) to find out how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining marshmallows:

S'mores each kid can make = Marshmallows left / 2

One of Jack's friends plays for half the time Jack does, so their playtime is 0.5 units.
The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so their playtime is 1.5 units.

Together, they play for a total of 4 hours. We need to convert this time into units based on Jack's playtime.

1 hour = 60 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now we can find out how many units of playtime they had in total:

Total playtime = Jack's playtime + Friend 1's playtime + Friend 2's playtime

Since Jack's playtime is 1 unit, Friend 1's playtime is 0.5 units, and Friend 2's playtime is 1.5 units:

Total playtime = 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 3 units

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we can find out how many quarters they used by dividing their total playtime by Jack's playtime and then multiplying by the number of quarters Jack uses for 20 minutes:

Quarters used = Total playtime * Quarters per minute for Jack

Total playtime = 3 units
Quarters per minute for Jack = 1 quarter / 20 minutes = 0.05 quarters per minute

Quarters used = 3 units * 0.05 quarters per minute = 0.15 quarters

First, let's find the amount of salt, sugar, citrus zest, and oil she uses:

1. Salt: She uses twice as much salt as zest, so if she uses x ounces of zest, she uses 2x ounces of salt.
2. Sugar: She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2x ounces of sugar.
3. Citrus zest: She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and we'll find the amount of fragrance later.
4. Oil: She uses twice as much oil as salt, so if she uses 2x ounces of salt, she uses 4x ounces of oil.

The jar holds enough ingredients to make 10 ounces of salt scrub. Since the jar is filled with a combination of all the ingredients, we can find the total weight of all the ingredients and then divide by the number of ingredients to find the weight of each ingredient.

Let x be the weight of citrus zest and fragrance.

Total weight = Salt + Sugar + Citrus zest + Fragrance + Oil

We know that:
Salt = 2x
Sugar = 2x
Citrus zest = x
Fragrance = x
Oil = 4x

Total weight = (2x + 2x + x + x + 4x) = 9x + 4x = 13x

Since the jar holds 10 ounces of salt scrub, we can set up the equation:

10 oz = 13x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 13:

x = 10 oz / 13 ≈ 0.77 oz

825," Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. According to the problem, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has x + 12 more cards. The total number of cards is 341.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cards:

x + (x + 12) + 3x = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

5x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

5x = 329

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 65.8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a card, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, PJ has 66 cards.

Now, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

Becca = x + 12 = 66 + 12 = 78

826," To find out how many eggs Cindy had in total, we need to determine the number of each type of egg she found.

First, let's find the number of blue eggs. We know that Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, and she had 5 green eggs. So, the number of blue eggs is 2 * 5 = 10.

Next, we know that Cindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

We also know that she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy had is the sum of the number of green, blue, pink, and yellow eggs:

The final answer is 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27 eggs.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
827," To calculate the total cost Milly will incur to return the book and the amount she will get refunded by Amazon, we need to find the shipping cost and the refunded amount separately.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- The book weighs 4 pounds.
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.

Shipping cost = Weight of the book * Cost per pound
Shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound
Shipping cost = $1.40

Next, let's calculate the distance-related cost:
- The distribution center is 20 miles away.
- The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Distance-related cost = Distance * Cost per mile
Distance-related cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile
Distance-related cost = $1.60

Now, let's calculate the total shipping cost:
Total shipping cost = Shipping cost + Distance-related cost
Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Total shipping cost = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refunded amount from Amazon:
- The book cost $32.
- Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price.

Refunded amount = Purchase price * Refund percentage
Refunded amount = $32 * 0.75
Refunded amount = $24.32

Finally, let's calculate the net loss for Milly:
Net loss = Total shipping cost - Refunded amount
Net loss = $3.00 - $24.32
Net loss = -$21.32

The final answer is Milly will lose $21.32.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

830," To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we first need to find out how much time she spends on TikTok each week, and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok each week:

1. She records 18 videos per week, and each video takes 4 minutes to make. So, she spends 18 * 4 = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes on recording videos each week.
2. She spends 2 hours writing songs for her TikTok videos. So, she spends 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes on songwriting each week.
3. She spends 15 minutes doing makeup six days a week. So, she spends 15 * 6 = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes on makeup each week.

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok each week is 72 + 120 + 90 = <<72+120+90=282>>282 minutes.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks:

The answer is: Britany spends 282 minutes per week on TikTok, and there are four weeks in a month. So, she spends 282 * 4 = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes, or 18 hours and 48 minutes, on TikTok in a month.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
831," To calculate the cost for Angela, we first need to determine how many additional items she has beyond what's included in the base installation. We know that the base installation includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela has 6 mirrors (2 more than the base installation), 2 chandeliers (1 more than the base installation), and 20 pictures (10 more than the base installation).

Additional mirrors: 2
Additional chandeliers: 1
Additional pictures: 10

Total additional items: 2 + 1 + 10 = 13

The cost for each additional item is $15.00, so the total cost for Angela will be:

Cost = Number of additional items * Cost per additional item
Cost = 13 * $15.00
Cost = $195.00

Now, let's add the base installation cost of $129.00 to the cost of the additional items:

Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost of additional items
Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00
Total cost = $324.00

Let's call the amount of money Anthony has saved ""A."" Then, Roy has saved $A + 40% * A. We want to find the value of A, so we can add it to the amount Eva has saved to find the total amount of money Roy has saved.

First, let's find the value of $A$:

$A + $10.00 = Eva's savings + $10.00
$A + $10.00 = $20.00
$A = $10.00

Now that we know Anthony has saved $10.00, we can calculate how much more money Roy has saved:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% * Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $10.00 + 0.4 * $10.00
Roy's savings = $10.00 + $4.00
Roy's savings = $14.00

Since we know Eva has saved $20.00, Roy's total savings is the sum of his additional savings and Eva's savings:

Roy's total savings = Roy's savings + Eva's savings
Roy's total savings = $14.00 + $20.00
Roy's total savings = $34.00

Result: Roy has saved $34.00.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
833," To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the height of a mountain that is ten times higher than the one Kagiyama can lift, and then twelve times higher than that mountain.

First, let's find the height of the mountain that Kagiyami can lift. We know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Therefore, the height of the mountain that Saskay can lift is 12 inches. Kagiyama can lift a mountain that is 4 times higher than the one Saskay can lift, so the height of the mountain that Kagiyama can lift is 48 inches (12 inches x 4).

Next, we need to find the height of the mountain that Naruto can lift. Naruto can lift a mountain that is ten times higher than the one Kagiyama can lift, so the height of the mountain that Naruto can lift is 480 inches (48 inches x 10).

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain that is 40 feet high (480 inches / 12 inches per foot).

836," To find out how many clay dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora make together, we first need to determine how many dishes each person makes. We know that:

1. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
3. Kora makes 20 dishes.

Let's denote the number of dishes Rory makes as x. Then, Jada makes 2x dishes, and the total number of dishes they all make is x (Rory's dishes) + 2x (Jada's dishes) + 20 (Kora's dishes).

Substituting the information we have about Kora's dishes (20 dishes), we get:

x + 2x + 20 = 3x + 20

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can isolate x by moving all the terms with x to one side of the equation and constants to the other side:

3x = -20
x = -20 / 3

Since we cannot have a negative number of dishes, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. However, if we assume that Jada makes 3 times as many dishes as Rory instead, the problem becomes solvable.

With this assumption, Jada makes 3x dishes, Rory makes x dishes, and Kora makes 20 dishes. So, the total number of dishes they all make together is:

3x + x + 20 = 4x + 20

Now, we can solve for x by moving all the terms with x to one side of the equation and constants to the other side:

4x = -20
x = -20 / 4
x = -5

Since we cannot have a negative number of dishes, there is an error in the problem statement. It is not possible for Jada, Rory, and Kora to make the given number of dishes based on the information provided.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

839," To find out how many more cows the farmer needs to have in order to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine how much milk one additional cow would need to produce. Since the farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk from one cow daily, we can calculate the milk production of one more cow by finding the difference between the desired milk production and the current milk production from the three cows.

Milk production from 3 cows = 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day
Desired milk production = 15 liters/day + 25 liters/day = 40 liters/day

Milk production from one more cow = Desired milk production - Milk production from current cows = 40 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 25 liters/day

Since one cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we can find out how many more cows are needed by dividing the desired milk production from one more cow by the milk production of one cow:

Number of cows needed = Desired milk production from one cow / Milk production per cow

Number of cows needed = 25 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = \boxed{5}

So, the farmer needs to have 5 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. The first stick has 1/6 of the glue left.
2. The second stick has 2/3 of the glue left.
3. The third stick has 1/2 of the glue left.

Now, we know that the entire glue stick is 12 millimeters long. To find the length of the unused glue on each stick, we'll multiply the amount of glue left by the length of the entire stick and then sum up the results for all three sticks.

1. The length of the unused glue on the first stick is: (1/6) * 12 = 2 cm
2. The length of the unused glue on the second stick is: (2/3) * 12 = 8 cm

844," Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of socks Peter has as 2S. We know that Jack has half as many dishes as Peter, so the number of dishes Jack has is S/2. We also know that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store, so the number of dishes he has is 2S.

From the given information, we have two equations:

1. S (socks Jack has) = 0.5 * (Socks Peter has)
2. S (socks Jack has) = 0.5 * (Dishes Jack has)
3. 2S (dishes Jack has) = S (socks Jack has) * 2

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

S = 0.5 * (Socks Peter has)

Now, let's substitute S from the third equation into the first equation:

S = 0.5 * (Dishes Peter has / 2)

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

S = 0.5 * Dishes Peter has

Since Jack has twice as many socks as Peter, we can write:

Socks Peter has = S
Dishes Peter has = 2S

Substituting these values into the equation for S, we get:

S = 0.5 * Dishes Peter has
S = 0.5 * 2S
S = S

This equation is only true if Dishes Peter has = 2S. Therefore, Peter has 2S socks, and Jack has S socks. The total number of socks they have together is 3S.

Now, we know that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store, and he had 60 dishes. So, the number of socks Jack had in the store was 60/2 = 30. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, Peter had 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

The total number of dishes they have together is Jack's dishes plus Peter's dishes, which is S + 2S = 3S.

So, the final answer is: Peter has 60 socks, and they have a total of 60 socks for Peter and 3S dishes for both of them. Since Jack has half as many dishes as Peter, the total number of dishes they have together is 3S/2 + 60 = (3/2)*61.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

847," To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest she earns each year and then add that to her initial investment.

The formula for simple interest is:

I = P * r * t

where:
- I is the interest
- P is the principal amount (initial investment)
- r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
- t is the time in years

First, let's find the annual interest:

r = 0.75 * 1 (since the interest rate is given as a percentage of the principal)

Now, we can calculate the interest earned each year:

I1 = 300 * 0.75 * 1
I1 = 225

So, after the first year, Brenda will have:

300 + 225 = 525

We can repeat this process for the next two years:

r = 0.75 * 1
I2 = 525 * 0.75 * 1
I2 = 391.25

After the second year, Brenda will have:

855," Let's denote your age as X, your brother's age as Y, and your sister's age as Z. From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. X = Y - 3
2. X = Z + 2
3. Y = 3(M - 1)
4. X + Y + Z = 87

First, let's find the value of Y using equation 3:
Y = 3(M - 1)

Since you are three years younger than your brother, and your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, it means that your mom's age is 3 * (Your brother's age - 1).

Now, let's find the value of X using equation 1 and 2:
X = Y - 3
X = Z + 2

Since X is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:
Y - 3 = Z + 2

Now, let's solve for Z:
Z = Y - 5

Substitute Y with 3(M - 1) in the equation for Z:
Z = 3(M - 1) - 5

Now, let's find the value of X using equation 4:
X + Y + Z = 87
X + 3(M - 1) + [3(M - 1) - 5] = 87

Let's simplify the equation:
X + 3M - 3 + 3M - 8 = 87
6M - 11 = 87
6M = 98
M = 16.333333333

Since age cannot be a decimal, we need to find an integer value for M that makes all the ages integer. Let's try M = 16:
Y = 3(M - 1) = 3(15) = 45
X = Y - 3 = 42
Z = Y - 5 = 40

So, the ages are:

886," To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we first need to determine how many microphones can be arranged in pairs. We know that the singer has a total of 50 microphones.

Since we want to find out how many pairs we can make, we need to divide the total number of microphones by 2:

Number of pairs = Total number of microphones / 2

However, we also know that 20% of the microphones won't fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Let's calculate how many microphones that represents:

Number of microphones not fitting in = Total number of microphones * Percentage not fitting in / 100

Number of microphones not fitting in = 50 * 20 / 100

Number of microphones not fitting in = 10

So, we have 10 microphones that won't fit in pairs. That means we can arrange the remaining microphones in pairs:

Number of pairs = (Total number of microphones - Number of microphones not fitting in) / 2

Number of pairs = (50 - 10) / 2

Number of pairs = 45 / 2

Number of pairs = 22.5

Since we cannot have half a pair, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 22 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Two-thirds of the 75 outdoor plants are flowering plants: 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor flowering plants

The number of indoor flowering plants is given, so we don't need to calculate it: 25 indoor flowering plants

Now, we can find the total number of flowering plants: 25 indoor flowering plants + 50 outdoor flowering plants = 75 flowering plants

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (75 / 100) * 100 = 75%

We know that the salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. So, the cost of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of Ellen's daily diet is $11, so we can set up an equation to find the cost of one carrot:

Cost of 2 carrots + Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt = $11
2 * Cost of 1 carrot + $6 + $3 = $11

Now, we can solve for the cost of one carrot:

2. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x.
3. In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn x * 3 times.
4. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.
5. We know that Tasha earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, so her earnings from mowing lawns are 6x (since she mowed Joe's lawn x times and earned $6 each time).
6. To find her earnings from lemonade sales, we need to subtract her earnings from lawn mowing from her total earnings: $80 - 6x
7. Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of times Tasha mowed each lawn or sold lemonade, we cannot find an exact numerical answer.

- Daniel did not read any pages today

Let's denote the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as x. Then, we can write an equation to represent the information given:

Denise's reading today = Daniel's reading yesterday + 5
5 = x + 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5 - 5 = 0

So, Daniel did not read any pages yesterday either, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, the problem statement is inconsistent, and we cannot determine how many more pages Denise read than Daniel based on the given information.

For small masks, she uses 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. So, the amount of material needed for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards. To make 20 small masks, she would need 0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards.

For large masks, she uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. So, the amount of material needed for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = approximately 0.75 yards. To make 8 large masks, she would need 0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards.

Therefore, the total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class is 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

904," To find the average price of a ticket for Deepa, we first need to determine the total number of tickets she purchased and then divide the total amount she spent by that number.

We know that there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies, and Deepa saw each one in the theatre three times. So, the total number of tickets she bought is:

9 movies * 3 viewings per movie = 27 tickets

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

Now, we can calculate the average price per ticket by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

To get a final answer without any extra units, we need to divide the numerator and denominator by the same power of ten. In this case, we can divide both by 100 (since 216 has two digits):

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27
Average price per ticket = ($216 / 100) / (27 / 100)
Average price per ticket = $8.00 / 0.27

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.27 to get the final answer:

Average price per ticket = $8.00 / 0.27
Average price per ticket ≈ $29.63

However, since the question asks for the answer without any extra units, we need to find the whole number before the decimal point. In this case, the average price per ticket is approximately $29.

Duncan's age (8 years ago) = 2 * Adam's age (4 years ago)
62 (Duncan's age now) - 8 = 2 * (A + 4)

Now, let's solve for Adam's age in 8 years:

62 - 8 = 2 * (A + 4)

54 = 2A + 8
2A = 46
A = 23

So, Adam's age four years ago was 23. Now, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we can use the given information that Duncan's age is 60 now and Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago:

Duncan's age (8 years ago) = 2 * Adam's age (4 years ago)
60 - 8 = 2 * (23 + 4)

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, which is equal to 0.75 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so it takes 3 hours.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. Therefore, in 0.75 hours, he drinks 1.5 bottles of water (since half an hour is one bottle, and 0.75 hours is 1.5 times that).

In 3 hours, John drinks 6 bottles of water per hour (since he drinks one bottle every half hour), so he drinks a total of 18 bottles of water during an extreme sudoku puzzle.

Since a normal sudoku takes 0.75 hours and he drinks 1.5 bottles during that time, we can find the number of bottles he drinks during the normal sudoku by dividing the number of bottles he drinks during the extreme sudoku by 2.

So, John drinks 9 bottles of water during a normal sudoku puzzle (18 bottles / 2).

They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, and each tub costs $7, so the total cost of the ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total amount of money they spent is $11.5 (for the cake and balloons) + $14 (for the ice cream) = $25.5.

Since there were two girls, the total amount of money their mother gave them is $25.5 divided by the number of girls, which is 2.

The answer is: Their mother gave each of them $12.775. However, since we cannot give an answer with a fraction of a cent, we can round up to the nearest dollar and say that their mother gave each of them $13.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

First, let's find out how much profit each student made by selling one lollipop:
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Buying price
Profit per lollipop = $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3

Next, we need to find out how much profit each student made in total by selling 10 lollipops:
Total profit per student = Profit per lollipop * Number of lollipops sold
Total profit per student = $0.3 * 10 = $3

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by the class by multiplying the total profit per student by the number of students:
Total money raised = Total profit per student * Number of students
Total money raised = $3 * 30 = \boxed{90}$ dollars.

922," Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old, and she collects one shell every month. To find out how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate how many months have passed between her 5th birthday and her 10th birthday.

A person's age in years is equal to the number of complete months they have lived, plus an additional fraction of a month for the current month. So, the number of months between Martha's 5th and 10th birthdays can be calculated as follows:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
5 years = 60 months (since there are 12 months in a year)

So, Martha has lived for 65 months by her 10th birthday (60 months for her age, plus an additional 5 months for the current month). Since she collects one shell every month, she will have collected a total of 65 shells by her 10th birthday.

Therefore, ### Martha will have collected 65 shells by her 10th birthday.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
923," To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row in total. We know that Lana has 27 cups of tea and that she divides them into 3 rows. So, the number of cups in each row is:

Total cups / Number of rows = Cups per row
27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

Cups per row / 2 = Cups of mint tea per row
9 cups / 2 = 4.5 cups

However, since Lana can't brew half a cup of tea, she must adjust the number of cups in one row to make an even number of mint and chamomile tea cups. Let's assume she removes one cup of tea from one row and adds it to the row with 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Now, the number of cups in each row is:

Cups per row = Cups of mint tea per row + Cups of chamomile tea per row
Cups per row = 4 +4 = 8 cups

So, the final answer is:

The answer is: Each row has 8 cups of tea, with 4 cups of mint tea and 4 cups of chamomile tea.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
924," To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we first need to determine how long it takes him to pick up and eat the 24 berries. We know that the sloth spends 4 hours on each trip to collect and eat berries, and we want to know how many trips it takes to collect 24 berries in total.

Let's denote the number of berries picked up per trip as x. Then, the time spent on each trip is 4 hours, and the time spent eating the berries is not included in this calculation. Therefore, the total time spent collecting 24 berries is 4 hours * number of trips.

We want to find the number of trips that add up to 8 hours, so we can set up the equation:

4 hours * number of trips = 8 hours

To find the number of trips, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

number of trips = 2

However, this answer is incorrect because the sloth can't make only two trips in 8 hours. The error lies in the assumption that the time spent eating the berries is not included in the 4 hours it takes to make a trip. Since the sloth eats the berries during this time, we need to account for the time spent eating in our calculation.

Let's assume that the sloth spends 1 hour eating the berries for each 4 hours spent traveling. In this case, the total time spent on each trip is 5 hours (4 hours traveling + 1 hour eating).

Now, we can set up the equation:

5 hours * number of trips = 8 hours

To find the number of trips, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

number of trips = 1.6

Since the sloth can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the sloth needs to make 2 trips to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

To find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

x = 24 berries / 2 trips

x = 12 berries

The answer is: The sloth can pick up a minimum of 12 berries per trip.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
925," First, let's find out how much water Anthony and his father took from the pool. They took half of the pool's water, so:

Water taken = 10000 gallons * 0.5 = 5000 gallons

Now, the tank holds the water taken from the pool. So, the amount of water in the tank is 5000 gallons.

Each day, they use 500 gallons of water from the tank. To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we need to calculate the total amount of water used and subtract it from the initial amount:

Total water used = 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Remaining water in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Total water used

Result: \text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons } - 3000 \text{ gallons } = \boxed{2000 \text{ gallons}}",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}
926," First, let's find out how much money Colby has left after spending on movies, popcorn, and candy. The cost of movies is the sum of the cost of movies on Fridays and Saturdays, and the cost of movies on other days.

Cost of movies on Fridays and Saturdays = 5 * $10 = $50
Cost of movies on other days = 8 * $7 = $56
Total cost of movies = $50 + $56 = $106

Cost of popcorn = 2 * $8 = $16
Cost of candy = 4 * $2 = $8
Total cost of popcorn and candy = $16 + $8 = $24

Total amount spent = $106 + $24 = $130

Colby started with $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Now, let's find out how many movies Colby can see on this Friday with a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost of a movie, popcorn, and a box of candy is $10 (movie) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20. Since Colby has exactly $20 left, he can see one more movie.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
2. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one.
3. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories.
4. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from these are 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls = 40,000 calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
1. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
2. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one.
3. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.
4. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from these are 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = 45,000 calories.

To find the total number of calories in all the mini pastries, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:

- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

The total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is: 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie had a total of 62 toys. So, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the initial number of toys from the final number:

Number of bouncy balls = Final number of toys - Initial number of toys
= 62 - 48

931," To find the age of Peter, we know that his age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean. So we can set up the following equation:

Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age

Since we know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, we can set up another equation using this information:

Paul's age + Jean's age + Peter's age = 100

We can substitute Paul's age in the first equation with Jean's age plus 10:

Peter's age = (Jean's age + 10) + Jean's age

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Peter's age = 2 * Jean's age + 10

Now we have a relationship between Peter's age and Jean's age. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact ages of Paul and Jean, we cannot find the exact age of Peter. However, we can find Peter's age in terms of Jean's age.

Next, we need to determine how many tables they need to accommodate all the boxes. Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff, so they need as many tables as they have boxes divided by the number of boxes that can fit on one table.

The number of tables they need is: 60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables

934," To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spits out all their seeds combined.

For Zoey:
Total distance for Zoey = Number of seeds * Distance per seed
Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed
Total distance for Zoey = 400 feet

For Sydney:
Total distance for Sydney = Number of seeds * Distance per seed
Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed
Total distance for Sydney = 420 feet

Now, to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney, we add their total distances and divide by the total number of seeds they both spat:

Average total distance = (Total distance for Zoey + Total distance for Sydney) / (Number of seeds for Zoey + Number of seeds for Sydney)
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / (40 seeds + 35 seeds)
Average total distance = 820 feet / 75 seeds

The final answer is an average of approximately 10.8 feet per seed spat by both Zoey and Sydney. However, since the question asks for the average total distance spat, not the average distance per seed, we need to find the average of their total distances and divide by 2:

Average total distance = (Total distance for Zoey + Total distance for Sydney) / 2
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2
Average total distance = 820 feet / 2

1. Widgeteer 3000:
   Widgets produced in a day: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
   Widgets produced in a month (30 days): 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

2. WidgetMaster 9000:

   Widgets produced in a month (30 days): 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

3. Difference in revenue:
   Since each widget sells for $6, the difference in revenue is the difference in the number of widgets produced.
   Difference in widgets: 43,200 widgets (Widgeteer 3000) - 32,400 widgets (WidgetMaster 9000) = 10,800 widgets

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. To find the total number of hours, we need to subtract the arrival time from the departure time and add 12 hours (for the initial 12-hour stay).

Total hours = Departure time - Arrival time + Initial stay
Total hours = 10 am (next day) - 5 pm + 12 hours
Total hours = 1 pm (next day) + 12 hours
Total hours = 13 hours + 12 hours
Total hours = 25 hours

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 24-hour stay and the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the extra hours:

Cost of 24-hour stay = 1600 pesos
Cost of 12-hour stay + extra hours = 1000 pesos + (70 pesos * (number of extra hours))

To find the number of extra hours, we subtract the 12-hour initial stay from the total hours:

Extra hours = Total hours - Initial stay
Extra hours = 25 hours - 12 hours
Extra hours = 13 hours

Now, we can calculate the cost of the extra hours:

Cost of extra hours = 70 pesos * (number of extra hours)
Cost of extra hours = 70 pesos * 13 hours
Cost of extra hours = 910 pesos

The total cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos, and the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the extra hours is 1000 pesos + 910 pesos.

Total cost of 24-hour stay = 1600 pesos
Total cost of 12-hour stay + extra hours = 1000 pesos + 910 pesos
Total cost of 12-hour stay + extra hours = 1910 pesos

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the extra hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:

Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - (Cost of 12-hour stay + extra hours)
Savings = 1600 pesos - 1910 pesos
Savings = -310 pesos

However, since Cameron cannot pay a negative amount, it means that he would actually spend more money by choosing to pay for the extra hours instead of the 24-hour stay.

Discount amount = Cost of all CDs * 40%
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

Cost after discount = Cost of all CDs - Discount amount
Cost after discount = $150 - $60

Revenue from yams = 6 * $1.5
Revenue from yams = $9

Next, let's find out how much she earns from selling sweet potatoes:
Revenue from sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes * Price per sweet potato
Revenue from sweet potatoes = 10 * $2
Revenue from sweet potatoes = $20

Finally, let's find out how much she earns from selling carrots:
Revenue from carrots = Number of carrots * Price per carrot
Revenue from carrots = 4 * $1.25
Revenue from carrots = $5

Now, let's add up the revenue from selling all three types of root crops:
Total revenue = Revenue from yams + Revenue from sweet potatoes + Revenue from carrots
Total revenue = $9 + $20 + $5
Total revenue = $24

So, Jen will earn a total of $24 by selling all her root crops.

945," First, let's find out how far James swam during the first part of his journey:

Distance swam = Total distance * Percentage swam
Distance swam = 20 miles * 0.6
Distance swam = 12 miles

Time taken for the first part = Distance swam / Swimming speed
Time taken for the first part = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time taken for the first part = 6 hours

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time:

Resting time = Time taken for the first part / 2
Resting time = 6 hours / 2
Resting time = 3 hours

After resting, James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam
Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles
Remaining distance = 8 miles

Time taken for the second part = Remaining distance / Swimming speed (at half the speed)
Time taken for the second part = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time taken for the second part = 8 hours

Finally, James' total time to cross the lake is the sum of the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming again:

Total time = Time taken for the first part + Resting time + Time taken for the second part
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours

According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati scored x + 20 points. We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Together, Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar scored a total of 45 points. So we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

However, on the day in question, she slept on her bed from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. (since that's when her sleepwalking episode ended), and then she slept from 2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m. (the time she woke up from her bed after the sleepwalking episode).

To find out how long she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she spent sleeping on her bed during those two periods.

First, let's find out how many hours and minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m.:
- 10 p.m. is 22 hours in 12-hour format, so 2 hours have passed since 10 p.m.
- 1 hour and 15 minutes have passed since 10 p.m., which is equal to 75 minutes
- Therefore, she slept for 2 hours and 75 minutes from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m.

Next, let's find out how many hours and minutes she slept from 2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m.:
- 6 a.m. is 6 hours in 12-hour format, so no hours have passed since 6 a.m.
- She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she slept for 5 minutes less than her usual 8 hours
- Therefore, she slept for 6 hours and 55 minutes from 2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m.

Now, let's add up the total number of minutes she slept on her bed that day:
- 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
- 75 minutes
- 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes
- 55 minutes
- Total minutes slept on her bed: 120 + 75 + 360 + 55 = 560 minutes

Finally, let's convert the total number of minutes to hours:
- 560 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 9.33 hours

954," To find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has, we first need to determine how many measuring spoons come with each measuring cup. Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can set up a proportion:

Measuring spoons per measuring cup = 2/3
Let X be the number of measuring spoons per measuring cup.

X = 2/3

To find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has, we can multiply the number of measuring cups he has by the number of measuring spoons per cup:

Total measuring spoons = Number of measuring cups * Measuring spoons per cup
Total measuring spoons = 24 * X

Now, we need to find the value of X. We know that X = 2/3, so we can solve for X:

X = 2/3
X = (2 ÷ 3)
X ≈ 0.66667

Now, we can find the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has before giving any away:

Total measuring spoons = 24 * 0.66667
Total measuring spoons ≈ 15.56288

Since we cannot have a fraction of a utensil, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

Total measuring spoons = 16

After giving Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, we can find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left:

Occupied beds = Total capacity * Occupancy rate
Occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5)
Occupied beds = 2000 / 5
Occupied beds = 400

Now, let's calculate how many beds will be occupied after 2 weeks. We know that 50 new patients are admitted each day, so in 2 weeks (14 days), the number of occupied beds will be:

Occupied beds in 2 weeks = Occupied beds + (Number of new patients per day * Number of days)
Occupied beds in 2 weeks = 400 + (50 * 14)
Occupied beds in 2 weeks = 400 + 700
Occupied beds in 2 weeks = 1100

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity:

Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Occupied beds
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 1100
Unoccupied beds = -100

However, this result doesn't make sense since we cannot have a negative number of unoccupied beds. This means that the hospital will be over capacity after 2 weeks with the given admission rate.

Since she can't send a fraction of an email, we'll round up to 13 emails for her family.

Now, we know that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

16 total emails - 7 work emails - 13 family emails = 6 emails

However, we know that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend, so we need to find the actual number of other emails:

20% of 48 = (20/100) * 48 = 0.2 * 48 = 9.6 * 5 = 48

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we'll round this number down to 48. So, 20% of the reported number is 48. To find the actual number of people at the concert, we subtract this overstatement from the reported number:

48 (reported) - 48 (overstatement) = 0

However, this result doesn't make sense since there cannot be zero people at a concert. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement. It's possible that Courtney understated the number of people at the concert instead of overstating it. In that case, the actual number of people would be higher than 48.

On the third day, they dug eight holes, filled in two holes, and thus effectively dug eight new holes. So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 23 + 8 = <<23+8=31>>31 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the first day was 31 / 4 = <<31/4=7.75>>7.75.

Since Amora and Lainey each get 70 corn chips and Amora gets 15 more than Lainey, we can set up the following equation:

70 (Amora) = 70 (Lainey) + 15

Solving for the total number of corn chips, we get:

70 (Amora) = 85 (Lainey + Collins)

To find the number of corn chips for Collins, we subtract the number of corn chips for Amora and Lainey:

Explanation:
Greta made one dozen brownies for herself. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is equal to 6 brownies. At her surprise party, there were 4 dozen brownies, which is equal to 48 brownies. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is equal to 9 brownies. In total, Greta had:

\text{12 (for herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) - 9 (eaten during the party) = 65 brownies}

However, since the question asks for the number of individual brownies Greta had left over, we need to find the difference between the total number of brownies she received and the number of brownies that were eaten during the day.

\text{65 (total brownies) - 12 (for herself) - 6 (from the office) - 9 (eaten during the party) = 48 brownies}

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day. However, since we are looking for the number of individual brownies, we need to divide the total number of brownies by the number of brownies in a dozen:

\text{48 brownies / 12 brownies per dozen = 4.0 \text{dozens} \approx 4.17 \text{dozens} \approx 48 / 12 = 4 \text{dozens} \times 12 = 48 / 12 = 4 \text{dozens} \times 12 = 48}

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over, but since we cannot have a fraction of a brownie, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Greta had 48 - 12 = \boxed{36} brownies left over, but since we made an error in our calculation, the correct answer is 48 / 12 = \boxed{4} \times 12 = \boxed{48}, and we rounded down incorrectly, so the final answer is 48 - 12 = \boxed{36} \neq \boxed{21}. To correct our mistake, we should have calculated the number of individual brownies left over directly:

\text{65 (total brownies) - 12 (for herself) - 6 (from the office) - 9 (eaten during the party) = 48 brownies}

\text{48 brownies / 1 dozen = 4.0 \text{dozens} \approx 4.17 \text{dozens} \approx 48 / 12 = 4 \text{dozens} \times 12 = 48}

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over, and since we cannot have a fraction of a brownie, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Greta had 48 brownies left over, and since we made an error in our calculation, the final answer is 48 - 12 = \boxed{36} \neq \boxed{21}. To correct our mistake, we should have calculated the number of individual brownies left over directly:

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so that means she had 12 boxes minus the 4 boxes she gave away, which is 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington had in total is 8 x 20 = 160 oranges.

The oranges she kept for herself are 1/4 of the total number of oranges, so 3/4 of the oranges were sold. The number of oranges she sold is therefore 160 oranges x 3/4 = 120 oranges.

The answer is: Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
973," India has 28 states and 8 union territories, making a total of 36 political divisions. The USA has 50 states. Since India has 4 fewer states than half the number of states in the USA, we can find the number of states in the USA by finding twice the number of states in India and then adding 4.

Number of states in the USA = 2 * (Number of states in India) + 4

Substituting the value of the number of states in India (36), we get:

Number of states in the USA = 2 * 36 + 4
Number of states in the USA = 72 + 4
Number of states in the USA = 76

So, the total number of states in both India and the USA is:

Result: 76 (in India) + 50 (in the USA) = 126 states in total.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
974," To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then divide that by his hourly wage.

Total cost of books = Cost of dictionary + Cost of dinosaur book + Cost of children's cookbook
Total cost of books = $18 + $13 + $8
Total cost of books = $39

Now, we can calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books:

Number of hours = Total cost of books / Hourly wage
Number of hours = $39 / $5
Number of hours = 7.8 hours

Since Tyler cannot work a fraction of an hour, he will need to work at least 8 hours to afford the books.

975," To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to determine the number of cherries that both Richard and Jerry have. Since we know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up the following equation:

Richard's cherries = Robert's cheries - 10

We also know that the total number of cherries they are sharing is 60. Since Robert has 30 cherries, the remaining cherries must be divided between Richard and Jerry. Let's denote the number of cherries that Jerry has as J. Then, the number of cherries that Richard has is:

Richard's cherries = 60 - Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries

Since we already know that Richard has fewer cherries than Robert, we can write:

Richard's cherries = 60 - 30 - Jerry's cherries
                             = 30 - Jerry's cherries

Now, we can set up an equation using the information we have:

30 - Jerry's cherries = Richard's cherries
                                 = 60 - 30 - 10
                                 = 20

Solving for Jerry's cherries, we get:

Jerry's cherries = 30 - 20
                          = 10

So, Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has 20 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we simply subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

The final answer is: Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. (However, since the question asks for the difference in the number of cherries, the final answer should be stated as ""Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."")",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
976," To find out how much Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie on both days, we first need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of dessert on each day.

Let's denote the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as x. Then, the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is x - 4.

The number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday is 10, and the number sold on Sunday is 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling gingerbread and apple pie on each day:

Revenue from gingerbread on Saturday = Number of boxes * Price per box = 10 * $6 = $60
Revenue from gingerbread on Sunday = Number of boxes * Price per box = 15 * $6 = $90

Revenue from apple pie on Saturday = Number of boxes * Price per box = x * $15
Revenue from apple pie on Sunday = Number of boxes * Price per box = (x - 4) * $15

Since we know the revenue from gingerbread on both days, we can set up an equation to find the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday (x):

$60 (gingerbread revenue on Saturday) = 10 * $6
$90 (gingerbread revenue on Sunday) = 15 * $6

Now, let's find the revenue from apple pie on both days:

Revenue from apple pie on Saturday = x * $15
Revenue from apple pie on Sunday = (x - 4) * $15

Since we have the revenue from gingerbread on both days, we can set up another equation to find the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday (x):

$60 + (x * $15) = $90 + ($15 * (x - 4))

To solve this equation, we can first simplify it by distributing the $15 and $15 from the terms inside the parentheses:

$60 + x * $15 = $90 + $15x - $60

Now, let's get all the terms with x on one side:

x * $15 - $15x = $30

Next, we can factor out $15x:

$15x - $15x + $30 = $30

$15x = $60

Now, divide both sides by $15 to find the value of x:

x = 4

So, Sunny sold 4 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling gingerbread and apple pie on both days:

Revenue from gingerbread on Saturday = $60
Revenue from gingerbread on Sunday = $90
Revenue from apple pie on Saturday = 4 * $15 = $60
Revenue from apple pie on Sunday = (4 - 4) * $15 + 15 * $15 = $15 * $15 = $225

Finally, let's find the total revenue from selling gingerbread and apple pie on both days:

Total revenue = Revenue from gingerbread on Saturday + Revenue from gingerbread on Sunday + Revenue from apple pie on Saturday + Revenue from apple pie on Sunday
Total revenue = $60 + $90 + $60 + $225 = $335

Now that we know the red car costs $40, we can find the cost of the blue car by adding the cost of the red car to its price.

Total cost = Price of the blue car + Cost of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $40

1. We know that Emil is currently 19 years old and that when he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, we can write the equation:
   Emil's age (at age 24) = Dad's age
   24 = Dad's age

2. Next, we know that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, we can write the equation:

Let's assume Sophie's shoe size is S. Then, Charlie's shoe size would be 5S.

To find the average, we need to find the sum of their shoe sizes and divide it by the number of people (in this case, 2):

Average shoe size = (S + 5S) / 2

Simplifying the equation:

Average shoe size = (6S) / 2

The width of one plant, including the space between it and the next plant, is 12 inches + 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 15 inches.

The length of the flower bed is 111 feet.

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length by the width of one plant:

We know that the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years. So, the age difference between when Bill saw the Comet and when his father saw it is 2 * 75 = 150 years.

Since his father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, we can find Bill's age when he saw the Comet by adding 150 years to his father's age:

Bill's age = Father's age + 150

To find the father's age, we can set up an equation using the information given:

Father's age + 30 = Bill's age (when father saw the Comet)
Bill's age = Father's age + 30 + 75 (when Bill saw the Comet)

Now, we can set up the equation:

Father's age + 30 + 75 = Bill's age
Father's age = Bill's age - 105

Since we know that the father saw the Comet when he was 30, we can find Bill's age when he saw the Comet by subtracting 105 from his current age:

Bill's age = Father's age + 75 (when Bill saw the Comet)
Bill's age = (Bill's age - 105) + 75
Bill's age = Bill's age - 30

Now, we can find Bill's age when he saw the Comet:

Bill's age = Bill's age - 30
Bill's age = Bill's age + 75 - 30
Bill's age = Bill's age + 45

So, Bill was 45 years older than when his father saw the Comet when he saw it himself.

Chikote's howl length = 2 * Tobias' howl length = 2 * 20 = 40 seconds

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous' howl length is:

Igneous' howl length = Tobias' howl length + Chikote's howl length = 20 + 40 = 60 seconds

Now, to find the combined length of their howls in minutes, we need to convert the length in seconds to minutes. We know that there are 60 seconds in a minute, so:

Combined length in minutes = (Tobias' howl length + Chikote's howl length + Igneous' howl length) / 60

Combined length in minutes = (20 + 40 + 60) / 60 = 1.2 + 0.6667 + 1 = 2.8667 minutes

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4
Average age = 5 years

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so her age is:

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
Helene's age = 2 * 5

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. The sum of their ages is:

Sum of ages = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age
Sum of ages = 3 + 4+ 10

Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3 years

However, we already know that Akbar's age is 3 years. To avoid having two children with the same age, let's assume that Alessandro's age was 5 years instead of 4 years. With this assumption, the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene would be 12 years, and Wilfred's age would be:

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. So, we need to find out how much each neighbor has donated on average. We know that Walter received $500 from them, so the number of neighbors can be found by dividing the total amount they donated by the average donation per neighbor:

Number of neighbors = Total amount from neighbors / Average donation per neighbor
Number of neighbors = $500 / Donation per neighbor

Let's assume that each neighbor donated an average of $25 to simplify the calculations. Then, the number of neighbors would be 20.

Now, we can calculate the total amount donated by all neighbors:

Total amount from neighbors = Number of neighbors * Average donation per neighbor
Total amount from neighbors = 20 * $25
Total amount from neighbors = $500

Since Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as each neighbor, we can calculate his contribution as follows:

Lawyer's contribution = Average donation per neighbor * 3 * Number of neighbors
Lawyer's contribution = $25 * 3 * 20
Lawyer's contribution = $1500

However, Walter is only going to tell his lawyer about the $2000 he has collected so far and is expecting him to donate an additional $200. So, we need to add that amount to the total and recalculate the lawyer's contribution:

Total amount collected = $2000 + $200 = $2020

999," To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we first need to determine how many slices there are for the kids and how many slices there are for each adult.

Let's denote the number of slices for one kid as x. Since each kid gets one slice, there are 4 kids and therefore 4 slices for the kids.

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, so each adult gets 2 * x slices. Since there are 2 adults, they get a total of 2 * x slices.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the slices for the adults:

x (for kids) + 2x (for adults) = total number of slices
3x = total number of slices
x = total number of slices / 3

Now we need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets x slices and there are a total of 3x slices, each adult gets 2/3 of the total number of slices:

Percentage for each adult = (2/3) * 100%

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 170 minutes

Now, let's convert the minutes to hours: 170 minutes = 2 hours and 50 minutes.

To serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time:

5:00 pm - 2 hours and 50 minutes = 5:00 pm - 160 minutes

To find the latest start time, we need to subtract the total time from the number of minutes in a day (1440 minutes):

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars Lisa sold:

Chocolate bars sold by Lisa = Number of boxes sold by Lisa * Chocolate bars per box
                                         = 3.5 boxes * x

Similarly, we can find out how many chocolate bars Peter sold:

Chocolate bars sold by Peter = Number of boxes sold by Peter * Chocolate bars per box
                                         = 4.5 boxes * x

Now, we know that the total number of chocolate bars they sold is 64. So, we can write the following equation:

Total chocolate bars = Chocolate bars sold by Lisa + Chocolate bars sold by Peter
                                 = (3.5 * x) + (4.5 * x)

Substituting the values, we get:

1003," To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we first need to find out how much it costs to rent the studio per week, and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. So the cost to rent the studio per week is:

Cost per week = Cost per session * Number of sessions per week
Cost per week = $25 * 3
Cost per week = $75

Now, let's find out how much it costs per week to pay for the students. Each student costs $1.50 per session, and there are 10 students. So the cost to pay for the students per week is:

Cost for students per week = Cost per student per session * Number of students * Number of sessions per week
Cost for students per week = $1.50 * 10 * 3
Cost for students per week = $54

Therefore, the total cost per week for the dance studio is:

Total cost per week = Cost per week + Cost for students per week
Total cost per week = $75 + $54
Total cost per week = $129

There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:

Expected earnings in a month = Total cost per week * Number of weeks per month
Expected earnings in a month = $129 * 4
Expected earnings in a month = $516

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter as x and for Martha as y.

We know that:
- Peter has 4 boxes with x chocolate bars each, making a total of 4x.
- Martha has 7 boxes with y chocolate bars each, making a total of 7y.

The problem states that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. So we have the following equation:

4x = 64
7y = 56

To solve for x and y, we can first find the value of x by dividing both sides of the first equation by 4:

x = 16

Now we can find the value of y by dividing both sides of the second equation by 7:

y = 8

So Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box. To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we can subtract the number of chocolate bars in one of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in one of Peter's boxes:

Difference in chocolate bars per box = Peter's chocolate bars per box - Martha's chocolate bars per box

1012," To find the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to determine how long it took for the power bank to lose 28% of its total capacity. Let's call the total capacity of the power bank ""100%"".

First, let's find out how long it took for the power bank to lose 9% of its capacity each hour. We know that after 5 hours, the power bank had lost 9% of its capacity, so:

9% of the total capacity = 9% of 100% = 9% * 1 = 9

Therefore, the power bank lost 9 units of capacity each hour during the first 5 hours.

Next, let's find out how long it took for the power bank to lose 2% of its capacity each hour during the last 3 hours. We know that for 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity, so:

7% of the total capacity = 7% of 100% = 7% * 1 = 7

Since the power bank lost 2% of its capacity each hour during the last 3 hours, we can find the number of hours it took by dividing the percentage lost by the percentage lost per hour:

Number of hours = 2% / 1% per hour = 2 hours

So, during the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 2 units of capacity each hour.

Now, we can find the total time it took for the power bank to lose 28% of its capacity by adding the time it took to lose 9% of its capacity during the first 5 hours and the time it took to lose 7% of its capacity during the last 3 hours:

Total time = 5 hours (lost 9%) + 3 hours (lost 7%) = 8 hours

We know that she makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is $25. Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

Weekly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $25 * 40
Weekly earnings = $1000

Next, we need to find out how much money Janet needs to save each week to reach her goal of saving 20% of the cost of a $10000 car. To do this, we'll calculate 20% of $10000:

Savings goal = Total cost of car * Percentage to save
Savings goal = $10000 * 0.2
Savings goal = $2000

Now that we know Janet's weekly savings goal is $2000, we can determine how many weeks it will take her to save that amount:

Weeks needed = Savings goal / Weekly earnings
Weeks needed = $2000 / $1000
Weeks needed = 2

1017," To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia uploaded, we first need to determine how many pictures are in each type of album. We know that she put an equal number of pictures into each album, and that there are 3 selfie-only albums and 2 portrait albums.

Since there are 8 albums in total, and 3 of them are selfie-only, we can calculate the number of pictures in selfie-only albums by multiplying the number of selfie-only albums by the number of pictures in each album:

Selfies = Number of selfie-only albums * Pictures per album
Selfies = 3 * Pictures per album

Similarly, we can calculate the number of pictures in portrait albums:

Portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
Portraits = 2 * Pictures per album

We know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures, so we can set up an equation to find the number of pictures per album:

Total pictures = Selfies + Portraits
72 = 3 * Pictures per album + 2 * Pictures per album

To solve for ""Pictures per album,"" we can first combine the terms on the right side of the equation:

72 = 3 * Pictures per album + 2 * Pictures per album
72 = 3 * Pictures per album + 2 * (Pictures per album)
72 = 3 * Pictures per album + 2x

Next, we can solve for ""Pictures per album"" by isolating it on one side of the equation:

3 * Pictures per album = 72 - 2x
Pictures per album = (72 - 2x) / 3

Since both the number of selfies and portraits must be integers, we need to find a value for ""x"" that results in an integer value for ""Pictures per album."" By trial and error, we find that x = 12. This means that there are 12 pictures in each album.

Now we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits:

Selfies = 3 * Pictures per album = 3 * 12 = 36
Portraits = 2 * Pictures per album = 2 * 12 = 24

1026," First, let's find out how many pounds of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe. We know that a steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 50% more ore than with an iron pickaxe. So, the number of pounds of ore mined with a steel pickaxe is:

12 pounds (bare hands) * 1.5 (50% more) = 18 pounds per day

Now, we want to find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. So, the total amount of ore mined by all 40 dwarves in one day is:

18 pounds (per dwarf per day) * 40 dwarves = 720 pounds per day

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days:

720 pounds (per day) * 30 days = 21,600 pounds

1027," To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the given information that the prices are proportional. Let's denote the price of the package with 2 sandwiches as P, the price of the package with 4 sandwiches as Q, and the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as R.

We know that the number of sandwiches is proportional to the price, so we can write the following equations:

2 sandwiches -> $3 \Rightarrow P = 1.5 \times $3
4 sandwiches -> $6 \Rightarrow Q = 1.5 \times $6

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion:

$\frac{2}{3} = \frac{x}{Q-P}$

where x is the number of sandwiches in the package with 8 sandwiches, and Q-P is the price difference between the packages with 4 and 2 sandwiches.

Solving for x, we get:

x = \frac{2(Q-P)}{3}

Substituting the values of P and Q, we have:

x = \frac{2(Q-1.5\times 3)}{3}

Simplifying, we get:

x = \frac{2(Q-3)}{3}

Since there are 8 sandwiches in the package, we can set x = 8 and solve for Q:

8 = \frac{2(Q-3)}{3}

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

24 = 2Q - 6

Adding 6 to both sides, we get:

24 + 6 = 2Q

So, Q = 12.6. Since the prices are in whole dollars, we can round up to the nearest dollar: Q = $13.

Now, we can find the price R of the package with 8 sandwiches:

R = Q + (P-Q)

Substituting the values of P and Q, we have:

R = $13 + ($3- $13)

R = $13 + (-$10)

R = $3

However, this result does not make sense in the context of the problem, as the price of the package with 8 sandwiches should be higher than the price of the package with 4 sandwiches. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement, and it is not possible to determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given information.

Result: The price of the package with 8 sandwiches cannot be determined with the given information.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}
1028," To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we first need to determine how much he paid out of pocket for the new bedroom set. We know that he sold his old bedroom for $1000 and applied that towards the new bedroom set, so the amount he paid in cash was $3000 - $1000 = $2900.

Now, Tom is financing the remaining cost of the bedroom set through monthly payments. The total cost of the bedroom set was $3000, so the amount financed is $3000 - $2900 = $1000. Tom is paying 10% per month in interest on this amount.

To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula for a loan payment, which includes the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term (number of payments). In this case, the principal amount is $1000, the interest rate is 10% per month (or 0.10 as a decimal), and we don't know the loan term (number of payments).

To find the loan term, we can use the present value of an annuity formula, which calculates the present value of a series of equal payments over a certain period of time. In this case, we want to find the number of payments (loan term) that would make the present value of the monthly payments equal to $1000 (the amount financed).

Let's assume that the monthly payment is denoted by P, the interest rate is denoted by r (as a decimal), and the loan term is denoted by n. We can set up the equation as follows:

$1000 = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r

Solving for n, we get:

n = log((1 + r) / (1 - (P / $1000) * r)) / log(1 + r)

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

n = log((1 + 0.10) / (1 - (P / $1000) * 0.10)) / log(1 + 0.10)

Solving for P, we can use trial and error or numerical methods to find the value that makes n a whole number (since the loan term must be a finite number of months). Alternatively, we can use a financial calculator or spreadsheet software to find the exact value of P.

Without using a calculator, we can estimate the monthly payment by assuming a reasonable loan term (e.g., 36 months) and adjusting the payment amount accordingly. For example, if we assume a loan term of 36 months, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

P = $1000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.10)^-36] / [36 * 0.10]

P = $311.58 (approximately)

Therefore, Tom would have to pay approximately $311.58 per month to finance the remaining cost of the bedroom set.

The answer is: Tom has to pay approximately $311.58 per month to finance the remaining cost of the bedroom set.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

The probability of having a substitute teacher who doesn't collect the homework is 50%. The probability of the normal teacher giving an extension is 40%, and the probability of Marcus convincing the teacher about his dog is 20%.

To find the probability of all three events not occurring, we need to multiply the probabilities of each event not occurring:

1. Probability of not having a substitute teacher: 100% - 50% = 50%
2. Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 100% - 40% = 60%
3. Probability of Marcus not being able to convince the teacher about his dog: 100% - 20% = 80%

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950

Total seats for guests = Total seats in the Fine Arts Center - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total seats for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Total seats for guests = 5050

Now, we need to split these seats equally among the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = Seats for graduates / Seats per graduate (assuming each graduate has one seat)
Number of graduates = 950

To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the total number of seats for guests by the number of graduates.

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5050 / 950
Tickets per graduate ≈ 5.33

Let's denote the number of medium-sized beans as x. Then, the number of large beans is x/2 (since there are twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans). We know that the total number of beans that fill Grandpa up is 75 large beans, so:

x / 2 = 75

To find x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 150

Now we know that Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans. We also know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to multiply the number of medium-sized beans by the conversion factor:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans * Conversion factor

Number of small beans = 150 * 1 (since 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 1 small bean plus 2 small beans)

1046," To find out how many hours each painter worked every day, we first need to determine how many days are in 3 weeks. We know that:
1 week = 7 days

So,
3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Next, we know that the team of 4 painters worked for 3/8ths of a day every day. To find out how many hours this represents, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day into hours. We know that:
1 day = 24 hours

So,
1 hour = 1/24 of a day

Therefore,
3/8ths of a day = (3/8) * (1/24) = 3/32 hours

Now, we can find out how many hours each painter worked every day by dividing the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours worked per painter per day = Total hours worked / Number of painters
= 3/32 hours / 1 painter

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

Hours worked per painter per day = (3/32) / (4/4) = 3/128 hours

To convert this to hours, we can multiply by 60 (minutes in an hour) and then by 60 (minutes in an hour) again:

Hours worked per painter per day = (3/128) * 60 * 60 = 2.1875 hours

So, each painter worked approximately 2.19 hours every day.

To find out the total hours worked by each painter in 3 weeks, we can multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days:

Total hours worked per painter = Hours worked per day * Number of days
= 2.19 hours * 21 days

We also know that Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, so the number of balls he retrieved in the third set is x / 2.

The total number of balls Rory retrieved was 19, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 4 + x / 2 = 19

To solve this equation, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

Since there are 50 books in total, the remaining books must be in Spanish. So, the number of Spanish books is 50 - 25 (English) - 5 (German) = \text{20} books.

However, since we know that half of the books are in English, and 10% are in German, it is not possible for there to be only 20 books in Spanish, as that would mean there are only 45 books in total. The given information is inconsistent, and we cannot determine the exact number of Spanish books based on the information provided.

Therefore, assuming that the given information is incorrect and there are actually 50 books in total, the answer would be:

Result: \text{25} Spanish books",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. Distance covered by Bernice: She drives 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, so she covers a total of 325 km/day * 4 days = \boxed{1300} kilometers.

2. Distance between San Diego and New York City: The approximate distance between these two cities is 1955 kilometers.

3. Remaining distance for Bernice to drive: To find the remaining distance, subtract the distance she has covered from the total distance between the two cities: 1955 km - 1300 km = \boxed{655} kilometers.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
1051," To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to determine how many cups she drinks in a day and then convert that amount to gallons.

We know that:
1 day = 8 cups
1 gallon = 16 cups

So, to find out how many cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks in a day by the number of days:

Cups in 30 days = Cups per day * Number of days
= 8 cups * 30 days
= 240 cups

Now, we need to convert this amount to gallons. We know that:

1 gallon = 16 cups

So, we can find out how many gallons are in 240 cups by dividing the number of cups by the number of cups in a gallon:

Gallons = Cups / Cups per gallon
= 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon
= 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train. However, twice that number of people boarded the train, so 50 * 2 = 100 new people joined the train. So, the total number of people on the train after the second stop is 140 (from the first stop) + 100 (from the second stop) = 240.

At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so the total number of people on the train after the third stop is 240 (from the second stop) - 80 (from the third stop) = 160.

1054," To calculate the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor with the new square tiles, we first need to determine how many tiles you will need to purchase. Since each tile has a side length of 1 foot and the kitchen floor has a total area of 200 square feet, we can find the number of tiles required by converting the area to square feet and then dividing by the area of one tile.

First, let's convert the square feet to square tiles:
1 square foot = 1 square tile (since each tile covers an area of 1 square foot)

So, the number of tiles needed is:
200 square feet ÷ 1 square tile/square foot = 200 tiles

Next, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

Total cost = Number of tiles × Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles × $12/tile = $2,400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square tiles will be \boxed{$2,400}.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1056," To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we first need to determine how many loads it takes to wash all the sheets for one week.

There are 5 types of beds: 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Greg puts clean sheets on all of them every week.

Let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
1 week = 4 twin beds
So, 1 week = 4 * loads for 1 twin bed

Now, let's find out how many loads it takes to wash all the sheets for one twin bed:
Since Greg can wash 2 twin sets at a time, it takes 2 loads to wash all the sheets for 1 twin bed.

So, 1 load for 1 twin bed = 1 / 2 = 0.5 loads
1 week = 4 * 0.5 = 2 loads

Now, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
It takes 1 load to wash all the sheets for the king size bed.

So, in one week, Greg does:
Total loads = 2 loads (for twin beds) + 1 load (for king size bed) = 3 loads

There are 52 weeks in a year. So, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:

The final answer is 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads per year.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
1057," To find out how many movies Jill and her friends watch in one week, we need to find the number of movies they watch on both Saturday and Sunday. We know they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that number on Sunday.

Let's denote the number of movies they watch on Sunday as X. We know that X is half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, so:

X = 4 / 2 = 2

Therefore, they watch 2 movies on Sunday. The total number of movies they watch in one week is the sum of the movies they watch on Saturday and Sunday:

Total movies per week = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
Total movies per week = 4 +2
Total movies per week = 6

Now, to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks, we simply multiply the number of movies they watch in one week by 4:

Total movies in 4 weeks = Total movies per week * Number of weeks
Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 * 4
Total movies in 4 weeks = 24

3 cats * 2 feedings * 60 grams = 360 grams

To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food by the amount Imma uses in one day:

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

However, since Imma only uses 360 grams of cat food in one day, the 720 grams of cat food will actually last for 3 days.

1060," To find out how many slices Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate in total, we first need to determine how many slices Jake and Silvia ate.

We know that:
1. They shared 4 pizzas.
2. Each pizza had 8 slices.
3. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
4. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
5. Becky ate 10 slices.

Let's find out how many slices Jake ate:

Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can represent this relationship as:
Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Since they shared 4 pizzas, and each pizza had 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:
Total slices = 4 * 8
Total slices = 32

However, we have already calculated that Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 21 slices. This is not equal to 32.

It seems there is an inconsistency in the problem statement. The given information does not allow for a total of 32 slices to be eaten.

Let x be the length of Donovan's part in minutes. Then, the length of Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes. The total preparation time is the sum of Betsy's and Donovan's parts:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining the terms with x gives us:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. To find the length of Betsy's part, add 18 minutes:

3. Painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills
4. Parking: $6/hour * 2 hours

Now let's add up the costs:

Total cost = Cast + Visit + Painkillers + Parking
Total cost = $200 + $300 + ($4 * 30) + ($6 * 2)

Next, we need to determine how many of these emails James responds to. We know that 20% of his daily emails don't require a response. So, the percentage of emails James responds to is:

Percentage of emails responded to = 100% - Percentage of unanswered emails
= 100% - 20%
= 80%

Now, we can calculate how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week:

Emails responded to = Total emails * Percentage of emails responded to (as a decimal)

                                 = 1400

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon:

Cost of mailing small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost per small coupon
                                            = 700 * $0.05
                                            = $35

Cost of mailing big coupons = Number of big coupons * Cost per big coupon

1073," To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first two monkeys eat together in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas, and the second monkey eats 10 bananas plus 4 more, so the second monkey eats a total of 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.

Together, the first two monkeys eat 10 bananas (for the first monkey) + 14 bananas (for the second monkey) = 24 bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles buys enough bananas for a week for three monkeys, we need to find out how many bananas are in a week's supply for one monkey, and then multiply that by three to get the total number of bananas for all three monkeys.

We know that one week has 7 days, so there are 7 days' worth of bananas for one monkey. We also know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so the number of bananas for one week for one monkey is 10 bananas/day * 7 days = 70 bananas.

Therefore, the total number of bananas for all three monkeys for a week is 70 bananas/monkey * 3 monkeys = 210 bananas.

Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas, which is more than the 210 bananas needed for a week for all three monkeys. This means that there are extra bananas, which could be for unexpected guests or for the monkeys to eat beyond a week.

To find out how many extra bananas there are, we subtract the number of bananas needed for a week from the number of bananas Mr. Robles bought: 315 bananas - 210 bananas = 105 bananas.

Since we are only interested in how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can find that by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day from the total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought: 315 bananas - (10 bananas/day for the first monkey + 14 bananas/day for the second monkey) * 7 days = 315 bananas - (10 bananas/day * 7 days for the first monkey + 14 bananas/day * 7 days for the second monkey) = 315 bananas - (70 bananas/week + 98 bananas/week) = 315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas

However, since we made an error in our initial calculation of the number of bananas needed for a week for all three monkeys (we should have calculated it as 3 monkeys * 7 days/week * 10 bananas/day = 210 bananas), the actual number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is:

315 bananas - (2 monkeys * 7 days/week * (10 bananas/day for the first monkey + 14 bananas/day for the second monkey)) = 315 bananas - (2 monkeys * 7 days/week * 24 bananas/day) = 315 bananas - (2 monkeys * 7 days/week * 24 bananas/day) = 315 bananas - (2 * 7 * 24) = 315 bananas - 336 = -21 bananas

This result is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of bananas. Therefore, there seems to be an error in the problem statement, and we cannot determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day based on the given information.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he paid:

Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = 1.2 * (Price Mr. Rogers paid)

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then divide that difference by the original price:

Percentage discount = (Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid) / Original price * 100%

Substituting the expressions we have for the prices, we get:

Percentage discount = [(P - 1.2 * (0.75 * P)) / P] * 100%

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Percentage discount = [(P - 1.2 * 0.75 * P) / P] * 100%
Percentage discount = [(P (1 - 1.2 * 0.75)) / P] * 100%
Percentage discount = [(P (1 - 0.9)) / P] * 100%
Percentage discount = [(P * 0.1) / P] * 100%
Percentage discount = 100% * 0.1

Frankie's score = 2 * x + 15

We're given that Binkie scored 90. Let's check if this fits the given condition:

90 is 15 less than twice Frankie's score:

90 = 2 * Frankie's score - 15

Now, we'll solve for Frankie's score:

Frankie's score = (90 + 15) / 2
Frankie's score = 95 / 2
Frankie's score = 47.5

Since bowling scores are whole numbers, it seems there's an error in the problem statement. Let's assume Frankie's score is 48 instead, which is the closest whole number to 47.5 that still makes Frankie's score 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

The total amount of fence between them is 100 feet. So, we can set up the following equation:

S + (S + 60) = 100

Solving this equation, we get:

2S + 60 = 100
2S = 40
S = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 80 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we can subtract the amount of fence Sam has from the total amount of fence:

1086," To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we first need to determine how many bikes of each type he sold.

Let's denote the number of MTB bikes as x, BMX bikes as y, and Trekking bikes as z. We know that:

x + y + z = 300 (total number of bikes sold)

We also know that half of the bikes were Trekking bikes, so z = 300 / 2 = 150.

We know that 15% of the bikes were BMX, so y = 0.15 * 300 = 45.

Now we can find the number of MTB bikes: x = 300 - y - z = 300 - 45 - 150 = 105.

The revenue from selling one MTB bike is $500, so the revenue from selling x MTB bikes is $500x.

The revenue from selling one Trekking bike is $450, so the revenue from selling z Trekking bikes is $450z.

The revenue from selling one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so the revenue from selling y BMX bikes is $250y.

Therefore, the total revenue Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month is $500x + $450z + $250y.

Substituting the values we found for x, y, and z, we get:

First, let's find out how many shaken sodas are left:
1. Ellen shook 3 sodas.
2. Her brother took 1 shaken soda.
3. So, there are 2 shaken sodas left.

Now, let's find the total number of sodas Ellen's friend could get:
1. Ellen had 12 sodas initially.
2. Ellen took 1 soda for herself.
3. Her brother took 3 sodas.

However, since Billy works for only 5 days a week (he takes 2 days off), his actual volunteering time is:

21 hours/week * 5/7 = 15 hours/week

Now, let's find out how many weeks Billy works during the tax season. There are 31 days in March, and he takes 20% of the days off, so:

Total days = 31 (March) + 45 (April) = 76 days
Days off = 20% * 76 = 15.2 days ≈ 16 days
Working days = 76 - 16 = 60 days

Since Billy works for 5 days a week, the number of weeks he works is:

3. Six jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.
4. These six jellyfish must be the large ones that change color, since only they do so.
5. To find out how many large jellyfish there are, we can set up a proportion: Large jellyfish = Total jellyfish * 20%
6. We know that 6 of these jellyfish changed color, so we can set up another proportion: Changing-color large jellyfish = Large jellyfish * 33.33%
7. Solving these proportions, we get: Large jellyfish = 6 * 100 / 33.33 = 18.65 * 100 = 1865 / 100 = 19 large jellyfish
8. Since there are only whole jellyfish in the tank, we need to round up to get 20 large jellyfish.

Next, we need to figure out how much money she needs for her retirement, which lasts for 20 years and she plans to live with 40% of her current salary. So, her annual retirement income would be $40,000.

To find out how much money she needs in total for her retirement, we can multiply her annual retirement income by the number of years she plans to retire for:

1110," To find out how many more miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we first need to determine the total number of miles she plans to cover in June and then divide that by the number of days she will be on vacation.

Given: Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June.

First, let's calculate the number of miles she intends to hike each day:

Soledad hikes 125 miles each day.

Now, let's find out how many days it would take her to cover 9,300 miles:

Total miles = 9,300
Miles per day = 125

Days to complete the journey = Total miles / Miles per day

Days to complete the journey = 9,300 / 125

Days to complete the journey ≈ 74.88

Since Soledad cannot hike a fraction of a day, she will need to hike for an additional day to cover the remaining miles.

Result: Soledad must hike approximately 125 miles + (9,300 miles - (125 miles * 73 days)) ≈ 125 miles + 1,011 miles = 1,136 miles in total during her vacation to complete her journey on time. This equates to an additional ≈ 871 miles per day.

However, it's important to note that Soledad's plan to hike 125 miles each day for 75 days would result in her covering more than 9,300 miles, which is not possible. Therefore, her current plan is not feasible, and she would need to adjust her daily mileage or vacation length to achieve her goal.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1111," To find the total revenue the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the revenue generated by selling each type of ball and then add them together.

First, let's find the revenue from selling all the red balls:
Number of red balls = 3
Price per red ball = $9
Revenue from red balls = Number of red balls * Price per red ball
Revenue from red balls = 3 * $9
Revenue from red balls = $27

Next, let's find the revenue from selling all the blue balls:
Number of blue balls = 11
Price per blue ball = $5
Revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls * Price per blue ball
Revenue from blue balls = 11 * $5
Revenue from blue balls = $55

Finally, let's find the revenue from selling all the green balls:
Number of green balls = 25
Price per green ball = $3
Revenue from green balls = Number of green balls * Price per green ball
Revenue from green balls = 25 * $3
Revenue from green balls = $75

Now, let's add the revenues from all three types of balls to find the total revenue:
Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75

1122," To find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce in an hour to meet the order requirement, we first need to determine how many toys the other four workers produce in total during their shift.

First, let's calculate the number of toys produced by the two workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the number of toys produced by the other two workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the number of toys produced by all four workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since they have produced 200 toys and the order requires 400 toys, we still need to produce an additional 200 toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce in an hour, we can divide the remaining number of toys needed by the number of hours they have worked:

200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys/hour

However, since the question asks for the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour, we need to find out how many toys one worker can produce in an hour to meet the remaining requirement.

So, let's divide the remaining number of toys needed by 1:

200 toys / 1 = 200 toys/hour

Since one worker cannot produce 200 toys in an hour, we need to find the number of toys one worker can produce in an hour to meet the requirement. We can do this by dividing the number of toys needed by the number of hours remaining in the shift:

200 toys / (10 hours - 10 hours) = 200 toys/hour / 0 hours = undefined

This result is not meaningful, so we need to assume that the fifth worker works for the remaining hours of the shift. In that case, we can calculate the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour:

20 toys / 2 hours = 10 toys/hour

Therefore, the fifth worker needs to produce 10 toys per hour to meet the order requirement.

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
Number of boxes = 200 / 8
Number of boxes = 25

Since Nik cannot have a fraction of a box, he will need 26 boxes in total to accommodate all his crayons.

Next, let's calculate the weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
Weight of crayons = 200 * 1
Weight of crayons = 200 ounces

Now, let's calculate the weight of the empty boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the empty boxes is:

Weight of empty boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
Weight of empty boxes = 26 * 8
Weight of empty boxes = 208 ounces

Finally, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds. We know that there are 16 ounces to a pound, so:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of empty boxes

Let's denote the speed on the beach as S_b and the speed on the sidewalk as S_s. We know that:

- Grandma walks 2 miles at a speed of S_b.
- Grandma walks 1 mile at a speed of 2 * S_b (twice the speed on the beach).

The total time spent on the beach is given as 40 minutes, which is equal to 40 * 60 = 2400 seconds. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

1. Time on the beach: 2 miles / S_b = 2400 seconds
2. Time on the sidewalk: 1 mile / (2 * S_b) = 1 mile / (2 * (1 mile / 3 miles)) = 1 mile / (2/3) miles/hour = 1.5 miles / hour * 1 mile / 1760 yards/mile * 5280 feet/yard * 60 minutes/hour = 1134 minutes / hour

Since we know the total time spent on the beach is 2400 seconds, we can find the speed on the beach:

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees.

First, let's find the temperature of the remaining water in the first mug after Donny poured out 4 ounces:

Volume of water poured out = 4 ounces = 0.25 quarts
Volume of water left in the first mug = 1 quart - 0.25 quarts = 0.75 quarts

Let's assume the specific heat capacity of water is 1 calorie per gram degree Celsius (this is a reasonable approximation). The mass of 1 quart of water is approximately 2.2 pounds or 9.07 kilograms.

Heat energy required to raise the temperature of the water in the first mug from 33 degrees to 40 degrees:

Q = m * c * ΔT
Q = 9.07 kg * 1 cal/g°C * (40°C - 33°C)
Q = 9.07 kg * 1 cal/g°C * 7°C
Q = 604.21 calories

Now, let's find the heat energy transferred from the second mug when Donny poured out 1 ounce of water:

Volume of water poured out = 1 ounce = 0.0625 quarts
Mass of water poured out = 0.0625 quarts * 8.34 lb/gal * 1 lb/2.20462 lb = 0.0153 kg

Q = m * c * ΔT
Q = 0.0153 kg * 1 cal/g°C * (ΔT)

Since the temperature difference between the two mugs is 7 degrees Celsius, we can set up the equation:

604.21 calories = 0.0153 kg * 1 cal/g°C * (ΔT)

Solving for ΔT:

ΔT = 604.21 calories / (0.0153 kg * 1 cal/g°C)
ΔT ≈ 398.61°C

1138," To find the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we first need to calculate how many additional cows and chickens he receives each week from Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited, respectively.

Additional cows per week = 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week
Additional chickens per week = 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks by adding the initial number of animals and the number of animals received each week for three weeks.

Total number of cows = 50 cows (initial) + 140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 230 cows
Total number of chickens = 20 chickens (initial) + 70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens

Result: The total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks is 440 animals (230 cows and 210 chickens).",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1139," First, let's calculate the cost of four packs of bagels without the discount:

Cost of one pack = \$10.00
Number of packs = 4

Total cost without discount = Cost of one pack * Number of packs
Total cost without discount = \$10.00 * 4
Total cost without discount = \$40.00

Now, let's calculate the discount:

Discount = 10% of Total cost without discount
Discount = 0.10 * \$40.00
Discount = \$4.00

The final cost Russell pays for the four packs is the total cost without discount minus the discount:

Final cost for 4 packs = Total cost without discount - Discount
Final cost for 4 packs = \$40.00 - \$4.00
Final cost for 4 packs = \$36.00

Now, let's find out the cost of one bagel after Russell bought 4 packs:

Cost of one pack = \$10.00
Number of packs = 4
Number of bagels in one pack = 9
Total number of bagels = Cost of one pack * Number of packs * Number of bagels in one pack
Total number of bagels = \$10.00 * 4 * 9
Total number of bagels = \$360.00

Number of single bagels = Total number of bagels / Number of bagels in one pack * Number of packs
Number of single bagels = \$360.00 / (\$10.00 * 9)
Number of single bagels = 40

Since Russell bought 4 packs, he now has 40 bagels in total. Let's find out the cost of one single bagel:

Cost of one single bagel = Total cost for 4 packs / Number of single bagels
Cost of one single bagel = \$36.00 / 40
Cost of one single bagel = \$0.90

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days is the sum of the eggs he consumes during the first and second periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. So, the number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the number of green and red jellybeans:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - Number of green jellybeans - Number of red jellybeans

Substituting the given values, we get:

1144," To find out how many women have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted, we first need to determine the initial number of women on the bus based on the given ratio of men to women.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means there are 5 parts men and 9 parts women. Since the total number of parts is 14 (5 + 9), we can find the number of men and women by multiplying the number of parts for each group by the total number of parts and then summing the results.

Number of men = 5 parts * Total parts
Number of men = 5 * 84
Number of men = 420

Number of women = 9 parts * Total parts
Number of women = 9 * 84
Number of women = 756

However, the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, not 756. This means there is an error in the given ratio, and it cannot represent the actual number of men and women on the bus.

1145," To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we first need to determine how many sunflowers he sold from the individual sunflowers and how many from the bouquets each day.

Let's denote the number of individual sunflowers sold per day as x and the number of bouquets sold per day as y.

We know that:
1. The cost of one sunflower is $2.
2. The cost of a bouquet (which contains 12 sunflowers) is $8.
3. Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day.

From this information, we can create two equations:

x + 12y = total number of sunflowers sold per day
2$x + 8$y = $26 + $56 = $82 (daily earnings)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:
x + 4y = 41

Now, we want to find the number of sunflowers sold after 3 days. So, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply it by 3.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, we can solve the system of equations:

x = 41 - 4y

We know that x is the number of individual sunflowers sold per day and y is the number of bouquets sold per day. Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, we can find the number of individual sunflowers sold per day by subtracting the number of bouquets sold per day from the total number of sunflowers sold per day:

x = 12y - 12

Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the first equation:

12y - 12 + 12y = total number of sunflowers sold per day
24y = total number of sunflowers sold per day
y = total number of sunflowers sold per day / 24

To find the total number of sunflowers sold per day, we can use the daily earnings equation:

2$x + 8$y = $82
2(41 - 4y) + 8y = 82
162 - 8.4y + 8y = 82
0.4y = 80
y = 200

So, Faraday sells 200 sunflowers per day (160 from individual sunflowers and 40 from bouquets). To find the number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we can multiply the daily sunflower sales by 3:

3 * 160 = 480

Since there are four children, and each child is supposed to receive the same number of eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find out how many eggs each child gets.

So, the final answer is: Each child receives 36 eggs / 4 children = <<36/4=9>>9 eggs. However, since it's unlikely that each child would receive a fraction of an egg, it's more reasonable to assume that Chatty would have bought or prepared an additional whole dozen eggs for the activity, making it 48 eggs in total.

They divided all the seashells equally between themselves. So the total number of seashells they gathered is 2C + 5 + C = 3C + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally, each person got an equal share. Therefore, each person got 3C + 5 divided by the number of people, which is 3.

So, the calculation is as follows:

3(3C + 5) = 3C + 5
9C + 15 = 3C + 5
6C + 10 = 5
C = 1

Therefore, Carrey collected 1 seashell, Carlos collected 2 seashells (twice as many as Carrey), and Jim collected 5 seashells (5 more than Carlos). In total, they gathered 3C + 5 = 8 seashells. Since they divided the seashells equally, each person got 8 seashells divided by 3, which is approximately 2.67 seashells.

20% of daily energy demand covered by one bottle = 0.2 * Units of energy

Now we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover the entire daily energy demand of one person:
Number of bottles for one person = Units of energy / 0.2

Next, we'll calculate the total number of bottles required to meet the energy needs of 2300 people:
Total number of bottles for 2300 people = Number of bottles for one person * 2300

Finally, we'll find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:
Additional bottles = Total number of bottles for 2300 people - Current daily production

Let's calculate the values:
1 person's daily energy demand = 10,000 units (for the sake of example)
Number of bottles for one person = 10,000 units / 0.2 = 50,000 bottles

Next, we'll calculate the fruit production for each subsequent year based on the given information:

- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fewer fruits than a 10-year-old tree: 10 * 20 - 50 = 1500 - 50 = 1450 fruits
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, we can sum up the fruit production for each year to find the total fruit production during the 10-year life of the avocado tree:

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 1450 + 0 + 1000 = 2010 fruits.

So, an avocado tree can produce a total of \boxed{2010} fruits during its 10-year life.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

1168," Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the length of the blue rope as B, and the length of the red rope as R.

From the problem, we have three equations:

1. R = 4B
2. B = Y - 7
3. R + B + Y = 37

First, we need to eliminate one variable to have a quadratic equation. We can use equation 1 to express R in terms of B:

R = 4B

Now, substitute R in equation 3:

4B + B + Y = 37

Combine the terms with B:

5B + Y = 37

Next, we need to eliminate Y. We can use equation 2 to express Y in terms of B:

Y = B + 7

Substitute Y in the previous equation:

5B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine the terms with B:

6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

B = 5

Now that we have the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope using equation 1:

R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

1169," Let's first find out how much money Rissa was given. We know that she was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:

Rissa's money = 3 * Ronnie's money

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her initial amount. Let's denote the amount each sibling gave to their little sister as x. Then, Rissa's final amount is (4/5) * (3 * Ronnie's money).

We also know that Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their little sister. So, Ronnie's final amount is (x).

Now, we have two equations:

1) (4/5) * (3 * Ronnie's money) = Rissa's money
2) Ronnie's money + x = Ronnie's final amount

From equation 1, we can express Rissa's money in terms of Ronnie's money:

Rissa's money = (15/5) * Ronnie's money

Now, we can set up an equation using both expressions for Rissa's money:

(15/5) * Ronnie's money = Ronnie's money + x

To solve for x, we need to find the difference between both sides of the equation:

(15/5) * Ronnie's money - Ronnie's money = x

Multiplying both sides by 5/15 to get x on the left side:

x = (3/5) * Ronnie's money

Now, we can find Ronnie's final amount by substituting x back into equation 2:

Ronnie's money + (3/5) * Ronnie's money = Ronnie's final amount

Combining the terms:

(8/5) * Ronnie's money = Ronnie's final amount

To find Ronnie's final amount, we need to know how much money Ronnie and Rissa initially gave to their little sister. However, the problem statement does not provide that information.

Result: We cannot determine the exact amount left in Ronnie's money without knowing how much they gave to their little sister.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1170," Let's first find out how many pints of paint are in each half of the mural. Since half of the mural is yellow and the other half has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we know that:

1. Half of the mural uses 12 pints of yellow paint.
2. The other half uses the same amount of red, white, and purple paint combined.
3. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so let x be the number of pints of each of these colors.
4. Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple), the total amount of paint used for these colors is 3x.
5. The total amount of paint used for the entire mural is 12 pints (for yellow) + 3x pints (for red, white, and purple).

We know that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the following equation:

12 = 12 (yellow) + 3x (red, white, and purple)

Now, we need to find x (the number of pints of red, white, and purple paint). Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can find the number of pints of one color and then multiply it by 3:

x = 12 / 4 = 3 pints

So, there are 3 pints of each color (red, white, and purple) in the mural. Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

1171," To find the total area of the house, we first need to calculate the area of the bedrooms and the living room.

The area of one bedroom is length × width, so the area of one bedroom is 20 feet × 12 feet = 240 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 × 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

We know that the total area of the house is the sum of the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house. The rest of the house has an area of 1000 square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 4 bedroom areas + living room area + rest of the house area.

Total area = 4 × 240 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet

Total area = 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet

So, on Tuesday she saw 3 * 2 = 6 puffs of clouds, on Wednesday she saw 6 * 2 = 12 puffs, on Thursday she saw 12 * 2 = 24 puffs, and on Friday she saw 24 * 2 = 48 puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted during the week, we add up the number of clouds she saw each day:

1173," To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new, larger box. We know that the regular box has 100 pods and costs $12, so the cost per pod is $0.12. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, so we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (since 120% is the same as 100% plus 20%):

Number of pods in new box = Pods in regular box * 1.2
Number of pods in new box = 100 * 1.2
Number of pods in new box = 120

Now that we know there are 120 pods in the new box, we can calculate how many cycles you can run for $1 by dividing the number of pods by the number of pods used per cycle:

Number of cycles = Pods in new box / Pods per cycle
Number of cycles = 120 / 1
Number of cycles = 120

However, since you can only run one cycle at a time, you cannot run 120 cycles for $1. The final answer is that you cannot run any cycles for $1 with the new box using one pod per cycle.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
1174," First, let's find out how many $20 bills Thomas had after withdrawing from the bank: $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

Next, Thomas lost 10 bills, so he had 40 bills left: 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Then, Thomas used half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, he used 20 bills: 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

After that, Thomas tripled his money. To find the new amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $1000 * 3 = $3000.

Since Thomas had 40 bills initially, and he used 20 bills, he had 20 bills left before tripling his money. So, after tripling his money, he now has 60 times the number of bills he had initially: 20 * 60 = 1200 bills.

Finally, to convert all his bills to $5 bills, we need to find out how many $5 bills are equal to $1200: $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.

1176," To find out how many days the teacher can use the current piece of chalk before recycling it, we first need to determine how much chalk is left. We know that the teacher used 45% of a new 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

Let x be the number of days the teacher can use the current piece of chalk before recycling it. The amount of chalk used each day is 20% of the initial 5-inch piece. So, the total amount of chalk used up to day x is:

Total chalk used = 5 inches * 0.2 (used each day) * (x days)

We also know that the teacher used an additional 15% of the chalk on Monday (beyond the usual 20%). So, the total amount of chalk used on Monday is:

Chalk used on Monday = 5 inches * 0.2 (usual) + 5 inches * 0.15 (extra)
                                 = 5 inches * 0.2 + 5 inches * 0.15
                                 = 1 inch + 0.75 inches
                                 = 1.75 inches

Since the teacher recycled the chalk when it was smaller than 2 inches, we can set up the equation:

5 inches * 0.2 * x + 1.75 inches = 5 inches

To solve for x, we first need to isolate the term with x:

5 inches * 0.2 * x = 3.25 inches

Now, divide both sides by 0.2:

x = 3.25 inches / (5 inches * 0.2)

x ≈ 1.63 days

However, since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the next whole day. So, the teacher can use the current piece of chalk for approximately 2 days before recycling it.

Let's calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity:

Number of girls on varsity = Total number of girls * (1/3)
Number of girls on varsity = 12 * (1/3)
Number of girls on varsity = 4

Number of boys on varsity = Total number of boys * (1/4)
Number of boys on varsity = 12 * (1/4)
Number of boys on varsity = 3

So, there are 4 girls and 3 boys on varsity, making a total of 7 students on varsity.

Now, to find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 12 + 12
Total number of students = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Number of students on varsity

6 friends * (4 slices of pepperoni pizza per friend) = 24 slices

Now, let's check if the number of slices they will eat can be covered by one cheese pizza and two pepperoni pies.

Total slices needed = 36 (cheese) + 24 (pepperoni) = 60 slices

One cheese pizza has 12 slices, so we need to find out how many cheese pies are required:

Number of cheese pies = Total slices of cheese pizza needed / Slices per cheese pizza = 36 / 12 = 3

Since two pepperoni pies provide 8 slices each, we need to buy 2 pepperoni pies:

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pies and 3 pepperoni pies for her and her friends.

Result: \boxed{6} (This is the incorrect result due to a mistake in the calculation. The correct result is 7 pies.)

I apologize for the mistake in my initial calculation. The correct calculation is as follows:

For cheese pizza:
6 friends * (6 slices of cheese pizza per friend) = 36 slices

For pepperoni pizza:
6 friends * (4 slices of pepperoni pizza per friend) = 24 slices

Total slices needed = 36 (cheese) + 24 (pepperoni) = 60 slices

One cheese pizza has 12 slices, so we need to find out how many cheese pies are required:

Since two pepperoni pies provide 8 slices each, we need to buy 4 pepperoni pies:

Number of pepperoni pies = Total slices of pepperoni pizza needed / Slices per pepperoni pizza = 24 / 8 = 3

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a pizza, we need to buy an additional cheese pizza to cover the remaining slices needed for the pepperoni pizza:

Number of additional cheese pies = Total slices of cheese pizza needed for pepperoni coverage / Slices per cheese pizza = (24 % 12) / 12 = 1

First, let's find out how many snowballs Jay builds in an hour: 20 snowballs/hour

Next, we need to account for the 2 snowballs that melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour. So, Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, which means he loses 2 snowballs every 4 sets of 15 minutes or every 60 minutes (1 hour).

Therefore, Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but only keeps 18 due to the melting. To build 60 snowballs, Jay needs to build 42 more snowballs (60 total - 18 current).

Since Jay builds 18 snowballs in an hour, we can find out how long it takes him to build 42 more by dividing the number of snowballs he needs to build by the number of snowballs he builds per hour: 42 snowballs / 18 snowballs/hour = 2.3333 hours

However, since Jay can't build a fraction of a snowball, we need to round up to the nearest whole hour. So, Jay will need to work for 3 hours to build 60 snowballs.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 12 bandages left from the pack at the end of the day (50 - 38 = 12).

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, so they used 28 bandages (38 - 10 = 28). They didn't order any bandages on the second day.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages (50 / 2 = 25). They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have had 53 bandages from the second pack (78 - 25 = 53).

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages they used and ordered during the first three days:

Bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (half of the third day) = 81 bandages

Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages (first day) + 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages (third day) = 100 bandages

Since they used 81 bandages and ordered 100 bandages, it means they had 19 bandages left over from the orders (100 - 81 = 19). However, this information is not relevant to finding the initial number of bandages they had on the first day.

Therefore, the initial number of bandages they had on the first day can be calculated by finding out how many bandages were in the orders they made during the first three days:

One-third of the total number of fish have red stripes:
Number of fish with red stripes = (1/3) * Total number of fish

Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
Number of fish with red stripes = (1/3) * 66
Number of fish with red stripes = 22

Now, we have 66 - 22 = 44 fish without red stripes.

Next, we need to find how many of these fish have blue stripes:

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Number of fish without red stripes

Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:
Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 15

1204," First, let's find out how many shells were found by teams Alphas and The Finders. We know that team Alphas found 40% of the total shells, so we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of shells by 0.4 (which represents 40%).

Total shells = Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The Finders + Shells found by Gogetters

Shells found by Alphas = Total shells * 0.4

Now, we know that the remaining 60% of the shells were found by team The Finders. So, we can calculate the number of shells they found by multiplying the remaining percentage by the total number of shells and then subtracting the number of shells found by team Alphas.

Shells found by The Finders = Total shells * 0.6 - Shells found by Alphas

Since we already found the number of shells found by team Alphas, we can now calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the number of shells found by teams Alphas and The Finders from the total number of shells.

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas - Shells found by The Finders

Substituting the expressions for Shells found by Alphas and Shells found by The Finders, we get:

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells * 0.4 + Total shells * 0.6 - (Total shells * 0.4) - (Total shells * 0.6 - Shells found by Alphas)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells * 0.2 + Shells found by Alphas

Since we know that Shells found by Alphas = Total shells * 0.4, we can substitute this expression into the above equation:

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells * 0.2 + Total shells * 0.4

Combining the terms with Total shells, we get:

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells * 0.6

Now, we can find the final result by multiplying the total number of shells by 0.6.

1205," To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk on average to meet the group's requirement of walking 3 miles per day, we first need to calculate the total miles the four dogs need to walk each day and then divide that by the number of dogs.

Total miles needed per day = Miles for dog 1 + Miles for dog 2 + Miles for dog 3 + Miles for dog 4
Total miles needed per day = 1 + 4 + 3 + X

We know that the total miles needed per day for all four dogs is 3 miles on average. So, we can set up the equation as follows:

3 = 1 + 4 + 3 + X

Now, we can solve for X:

X = 3 - (1 + 4+3)
X = 3 - 8
X = -5 (This result is not valid, as a negative number of miles doesn't make sense.)

Since our calculation resulted in an invalid answer, it seems there is a mistake in the given information. The total miles required for the four dogs to walk per day cannot be met with the given individual mileage requirements.

Loan amount = $100,000

Next, we need to determine how much money John used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount for this purpose:

Money for debts = Loan amount * Debt percentage
Money for debts = $100,000 * 0.6
Money for debts = $60,000

Finally, we can calculate the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts:

1208," To find Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of each magazine for her. We know that she sells each magazine for 11/8 of the cost she paid.

Let's denote the cost price of one magazine as C and the selling price as S. We have the following relationship:

S = C * (11/8)

Given that Trinity bought 1 magazine for $72, we can find the cost price per magazine:

C = $72

Now, we can calculate the selling price:

S = C * (11/8)
S = $72 * (11/8)
S = $72 * (1.375)
S = $99

Since Trinity sells each magazine for $99, her profit per magazine is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

Profit per magazine = S - C
Profit per magazine = $99 - $72
Profit per magazine = $27

To find her total profit, we need to multiply the profit per magazine by the number of magazines she bought:

Total profit = Profit per magazine * Number of magazines
Total profit = $27 * 1
Total profit = $27

1211," To find the amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to determine the amount of each medicine in one dose. We know that Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine.

Let x be the amount of the second medicine in mL for one dose.
Then, the amount of the second medicine in 3 doses is 3x.

Since the amount of the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we can write the equation:

14 mL (first medicine) = x mL (second medicine)
x mL (second medicine) = 3 * 14 mL
x = 42 mL

So, the amount of the second medicine in one dose is 42 mL.

Now, to find the amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of each medicine in one dose by 8:

Amount of first medicine in 8 doses = 14 mL/dose * 8 doses = 112 mL
Amount of second medicine in 8 doses = 42 mL/dose * 8 doses = 336 mL

Ali's class capacity is given as 120 students.

John's school has two classes, and each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, the capacity of one class of John's school is:

Capacity of one class of John's school = Capacity of Ali's class / 8
Capacity of one class of John's school = 120 students / 8
Capacity of one class of John's school = 15 students

Since John's school has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:

Capacity of John's school = Capacity of one class of John's school * Number of classes
Capacity of John's school = 15 students * 2
Capacity of John's school = 30 students

Finally, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school:

Let's denote the initial amount Stephen borrowed as P = $300. The monthly payment he makes is $25, and he pays for 11 months. So, the total amount Stephen pays during the first 11 months is:

$25 \cdot 11 = \boxed{275}$

Now, we need to find the remaining amount that Stephen owes his sister after 11 months of payments. We can calculate this by subtracting the total amount he paid during the first 11 months from the initial amount he borrowed:

Remaining amount = P - $275

To find the total amount Stephen owes his sister in the twelfth month, we need to add the remaining amount to the total amount he paid during the first 11 months:

Total amount in the twelfth month = $275 + Remaining amount

Now, let's find the remaining amount:

Remaining amount = $300 - $275 = $25

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the side length. In this case, the side length of the base is 6 inches, so the volume of the base is V_base = 6^3 = 216 cubic inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches, so the volume of the entire jar is V_jar = 216 + 15^3 = 2916.1 cubic inches (approximately).

Next, we need to find the number of total jelly beans in the jar. We know that about 80% of the volume is used efficiently, so the actual number of jelly beans is N = V_jar * efficiency = 2916.1 * 0.8 = 2332.88.

We also know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so the number of red jelly beans is N_red = 0.3 * N = 0.3 * 2332.88 = 699.86. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a jelly bean, we need to round this number to the nearest integer, which is 700.

Cost of tables = Number of tables * Cost of one table
Cost of tables = 4 * $20
Cost of tables = $80

Now, let's find out how much Ali pays for each roof frame:
Cost of one roof frame = $10

Next, let's find out how much Ali pays for the two roof frames:
Cost of roof frames = Number of roof frames * Cost of one roof frame
Cost of roof frames = 2 * $10
Cost of roof frames = $20

Finally, let's find out the total amount Ali has to pay John:

x + 4x = 40

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

5x = 40

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = \frac{40}{5}

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet (x = 8). To find the length of the longer piece, we can substitute x back into the equation:

1225," To find out how many cupcakes Carly made, we first need to determine how many brownies she made. We know that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x.

Then, the number of brownies is 2 less than 3 times the number of cupcakes, which can be written as:

Brownies = 3x - 2

Now, we know that there are 5 people in Carly's class, and each person gets 2 treats. Since there are two types of treats (cupcakes and brownies), we need to find the total number of treats, which is twice the number of people:

Total treats = 2 * Number of people
Total treats = 2 * 5
Total treats = 10

Since each person gets 2 treats, the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined is 10. We already know the number of brownies, so we can find the number of cupcakes by subtracting the number of brownies from the total number of treats:

Cupcakes = Total treats - Brownies
Cupcakes = 10 - (3x - 2)

Now, we have an equation with one variable (x). To solve for x, we need to isolate it. First, let's get rid of the parentheses:

Cupcakes = 10 - 3x + 2

Next, we'll move the constant term to the other side and change the sign:

3x = 8

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:

x = 8/3

Since x represents the number of cupcakes, we cannot have a fraction of a cupcake. This means that the given information is not sufficient to find an exact number of cupcakes Carly made. However, we can find an approximate number by rounding x to the nearest whole number:

x ≈ 3 (rounded down)

Carly made approximately 3 cupcakes.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
1226," The cost of a manicure for Karen is $35, and the cost of a pedicure is $40. When she gets both done at the salon, she receives a 20% discount. To find the discounted price of getting both a manicure and a pedicure, we first need to calculate the total cost without the discount and then subtract the discount.

Total cost without discount = Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure
Total cost without discount = $35 + $40
Total cost without discount = $75

Now, we'll calculate the discounted price by subtracting 20% of the total cost without discount:

Discounted price = Total cost without discount * (1 - Discount percentage)
Discounted price = $75 * (1 - 0.2)
Discounted price = $75 * 0.8
Discounted price = $60

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her ten fingers, the additional cost would be $3 per nail, and the total cost for nail art would be $3 * 10 = $30.

Therefore, the final cost Karen would pay for a manicure, pedicure, and nail art is the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art:

The answer is: $60 (for manicure and pedicure) + $30 (for nail art) = $90.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

2. The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.
3. The third magazine sends 4 times the number of issues as the second magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

So, Susan receives a total of 12 (from the first magazine) + 6 (from the second magazine) + 24 (from the third magazine) = 42 issues a year.

Since we know that one year's worth of issues for the 6-issue magazine is 6, we can find out how many magazines of that type she has by dividing the total number of issues by the number of issues per magazine: 42 issues / 6 issues/magazine = 7 magazines.

However, she only orders 3 magazines. So, it seems there is a mistake in the problem statement, and she actually receives 3 magazines with 12, 6, and 24 issues respectively.

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 8
Shelley's paintings = 35

Now we know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so the number of paintings Kim has is:

Price in December = P + 0.8 * P = 1.8P

Now, to find the price after the 50% discount in January, we need to subtract 50% of the December price:

Price after discount = Price in December - 0.5 * Price in December = 1.2 * Price in December

Substituting the expression for the Price in December:

Price after discount = 1.2 * (1.8P) = 2.16P

1232," To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we first need to determine how many pomelos she has left. We know that she started with 20 pomelos and is now left with 1/4 of that amount.

So, we can set up an equation:

20 (original number of pomelos) = 20 - x (number of pomelos given away) + 5 (number of pomelos Eve kept for herself)

We know that Eve is left with 1/4 of the original number of pomelos, so we can write that equation as:

20 = 5 + (4/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 = 5 + 5 * 2
20 = 5 + 10
20 = 15

Now, there are 60 - 24 = 36 apples left. He gave 25% of these to his sister, so the number of apples he kept is:

Apples kept = Total apples left * Percentage kept
= 36 * (1 - 0.25)

1235," To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered in 3 days, we first need to calculate how far he has traveled during that time. We know his average speed is 50 km/hr, so we can use the formula:

distance = speed * time

We need to convert the time from days to hours since Michael's speed is given in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now we can calculate the distance Michael has covered:

distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
distance = 3600 km

Next, we'll find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) Michael has covered:

1238," To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one week, we first need to calculate the cost of the cheese. Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for gruyere cheese. So, the cost of gruyere cheese is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00. The total cost of cheese for one week is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.

Bud buys one box of pasta each week, which costs $1.00. So, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

To find out how much Bud spends in one year, we need to multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year. There are approximately 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is $10.00 (per week) * 52 (weeks) = $520.00.

1239," To find the percentage of time spent cleaning classrooms on average per day, we first need to determine how many classrooms the custodian can clean in an hour and then calculate the percentage of their working hours spent on cleaning.

First, let's find out how many classrooms the custodian can clean in an hour:
1 hour = 60 minutes
It takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom
Number of classrooms cleaned in 1 hour = 60 minutes / 15 minutes per classroom = 4 classrooms per hour

Next, we'll calculate the percentage of their working hours spent on cleaning:

The custodian works 8 hours a day, so they have 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes available per day.
The number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms per day is 4 classrooms per hour * 8 hours per day * 15 minutes per classroom = 360 minutes.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the number of minutes spent cleaning by the total number of minutes in a day and multiply by 100:
Percentage of time spent cleaning = (360 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 0.75 * 100% = 75%

1240," To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to figure out how many books each bookcase can hold. Let's call one bookcase ""unit.""

1. Middle shelves hold 10 books each. Since there are two middle shelves, they can hold a total of 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.

Now let's calculate how many books Elly's current bookcase can hold: 20 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.

However, Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold and round up to the nearest whole number since she cannot have a fraction of a bookcase.

110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases

Since Elly already has one bookcase, she needs to get one more bookcase to hold all of her books.

1241," First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought in total. Since she bought five dozens, that means she bought 5 x 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 dozens, and in each dozen there are 12 eggs, so in total Rose bought 60 x 12 = <<60*12=720>>720 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the eggs for Rose. She paid $2.40 for one dozen, so the cost for all 720 eggs is 720 x $2.40 = $<<720*2.4=1728>>1728.

Now, let's find out how many eggs Rose will sell in total. Since she sells 3 eggs for $1, the number of eggs she sells is the number of dozens she had, multiplied by the number of eggs she sells per dollar, and then multiplied by the number of dollars she wants to earn. So, the number of eggs she sells is 5 x (1/0.3) x $X = 5 x 3.333 x $X, where X is the number of dollars she wants to earn.

To find the number of dollars Rose wants to earn, we need to find the difference between the cost of the eggs and her selling price. The cost of the eggs is $1728, and she sells 3 eggs for $1, so her selling price is $1728 / (3 eggs/dollar) = $<<1728/3=576>>576. The difference between the cost and the selling price is $1728 - $576 = $<<1728-576=1152>>1152.

Now we can find the number of eggs Rose sells: 5 x 3.333 x $1152 = 5 x 3.333 x 1152 = 18960.32. Since she can't sell a fraction of an egg, she can sell at most 18960 eggs.

So, the profit for Rose is the difference between the selling price and the cost of the eggs: $1152. The answer is: $1152.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
1242," To find the number of white hats Skyler has, we first need to determine how many hats are red and how many are blue.

1. We know that half of the hats are red. So, the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.
2. The remaining hats are blue and white. The number of blue hats is 3/5 of the remaining hats. Let's denote the total number of hats as x. So, the number of blue hats is x * 3/5.
3. Since we know the number of red hats is 50, we can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats: x - 50 - (x * 3/5).
4. To find the value of x, we can set up an equation and solve for it: x = 50 + (x * 3/5) + 50.
5. Solving for x, we get x = 150. However, since Skyler only has 100 hats, this solution is not valid. This means that it's impossible for Skyler to have the given distribution of hats with 100 hats.

Let's denote the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test as x. The total number of questions in both tests is 70 (from the first test) + 40 (from the second test) = 110.

The percentage of questions Audrey must answer correctly to pass the 6th grade is 70%. Therefore, she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, which is 110 * 0.7 = \boxed{77}.

Since Audrey answered 60% of the questions correctly on the first test, she answered 70 questions * 0.6 = \boxed{42} questions correctly.

To move on to the 7th grade, Audrey needs to answer a total of 77 questions correctly. She has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. Therefore, she needs to answer 77 - 42 = \boxed{35} questions correctly on the second test.

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Since we have the number of strawberry cubes (x), we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the formula above.

First, let's find the number of strawberry cubes by solving the equation x + (5x - 4) = 116 for x:

6x = 112
x = 18.6667 (approximately)

Since the number of ice cubes must be a whole number, we need to round x down to 18.

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

Footballs (F) = 2 * Helmets (H)
F = 2 * 20
F = 40

Now we know that there are half as many robots as helmets, so we can find the number of robots by finding half of the number of helmets:

Number of batches per week = Batches per day * Days per week
= 6 batches/day * 7 days/week
= 42 batches/week

Next, we need to find out how many weeks it takes for Jade to upload all her photos. We know that she has taken 210 photos:

Number of weeks = Total number of photos / Number of photos per batch per week

1266," To find out how much dog food is needed for all the dogs in a week, we first need to calculate the daily food consumption for all dogs, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

There are 3 German Shepherds, each consuming 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the daily food consumption for German Shepherds is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kilograms/German Shepherd = 15 kilograms

There are 2 Bulldogs, each consuming 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the daily food consumption for Bulldogs is:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kilograms/Bulldog = 6 kilograms

The total daily food consumption for all dogs is:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms

Now, to find out how much dog food is needed in a week, we multiply the total daily food consumption by the number of days in a week (7 days):

1267," To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we first need to determine the number of legs for each type of animal. We know that 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, and 4-legged animals have 4 legs each.

Let's calculate the number of legs for each type of animal:

1. 2-legged animals: There are 10 animals, and each animal has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs for 2-legged animals is 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
2. 4-legged animals: There are 15 animals, and each animal has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs for 4-legged animals is 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, let's add the number of legs for both types of animals to find the total number of legs on the farm:

Total legs = Legs for 2-legged animals + Legs for 4-legged animals
Total legs = 20 + 60
Total legs = 80

1271," To find the number of pink candies in the bag, we first need to determine the number of orange candies and then subtract the total number of red, yellow, and orange candies from the total number of candies in the bag.

We know that there are 54 red candies, and there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, the number of orange candies is:

Orange candies = 2 * Red candies
Orange candies = 2 * 54
Orange candies = 108

Next, we know that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is:

Yellow candies = 0.5 * Red candies
Yellow candies = 0.5 * 54
Yellow candies = 27

Now, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

Total candies = Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies
Total candies = 54 + 108 + 27
Total candies = 189

Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 * x

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, we can find the total cost of her bus trips by multiplying the cost of one bus trip by the number of bus rides:

Total cost of bus trips = Cost of one bus trip * Number of bus rides
Total cost of bus trips = (0.1 * x) * 7

Now, we know that Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, and the cost of one night was $80. So, the total cost of her hotel stay is:

Total cost of hotel = Cost of one night at the hotel * Number of nights
Total cost of hotel = $80 * 3
Total cost of hotel = $240

To find the total amount Helen paid for her trip, we add the cost of her hotel stay to the cost of her bus trips:

Total cost of trip = Total cost of hotel + Total cost of bus trips
Total cost of trip = $240 + ((0.1 * $80) * 7)

Calculating the value inside the parentheses:

Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 * $80 = $8
Total cost of bus trips = $8 * 7 = $56

x + 21 = 52 (total marbles Mazie had) - 4 (marbles Dallas dropped)

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 52 - 25
x = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Dallas. Since Mazie had 52 marbles initially, we can find the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting the number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas from the total number of marbles Mazie had:

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Marbles given to Dallas

She also spent $8.50 on a bracelet, making her total spending at the mall $23.00. Her parents gave her $40. So, to find out how much money Janet has left, we need to subtract her spending from the amount her parents gave her.

$40 (given by parents) - $23.00 (spending at the mall) = $17.00

Next, we need to find out how many cars he services in 2 weeks. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, there are 10 working days in 2 weeks:

Cars serviced in 2 weeks = Cars per week * 2 weeks

1302," To find out how much money Matthew would earn if he sells his toy soldiers according to the given offer, we first need to determine how many soldiers he would sell at each price. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers in total, we can divide them into two equal parts of 6 soldiers each.

He would sell the first half (6 soldiers) at $5 per soldier, so the total amount for this half would be:
6 soldiers * $5 per soldier = $30

Similarly, he would sell the second half (also 6 soldiers) at $7 per soldier, so the total amount for this half would be:
6 soldiers * $7 per soldier = $42

Therefore, the total amount Matthew would earn if he agrees to the buyer's offer would be the sum of the amounts for both halves:
$30 (first half) + $42 (second half) = $72

Result: Matthew would earn $72 if he sells his toy soldiers according to the given offer.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

1304," To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. We know that Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, so:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * Average enrollment at Norman High School

Substituting the given value of 4000 students for the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000

Calculating the value:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3000 students

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School

Substituting the calculated values:

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000

Calculating the value:

Difference in average enrollment = 1000 students

1306," To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we first need to determine how many beakers he was supposed to gather and how many he actually placed on the lab bench.

We know that Igor was supposed to gather 14 Petri dishes and 7 beakers. He gathered 14 Petri dishes, but only placed 29 items in total on the lab bench. Since he gathered 16 test tubes, which is half the number of test tubes requested, and 2 more Petri dishes than requested, we can calculate the number of beakers he lost as follows:

Number of beakers Igor was supposed to gather = 7
Number of items Igor placed on the lab bench = 29
Number of test tubes Igor gathered = 16
Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered = 14 + 2 = 16

Since Igor gathered 2 fewer Petri dishes than requested, he must have lost 2 beakers. However, the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 2 less than what we would expect if he had gathered all the requested items, so there is an additional error.

Let's call the number of beakers Igor lost due to forgetting to gather the correct number of Petri dishes ""Error 1"" and the number of beakers he lost due to losing some on the way to the lab bench ""Error 2"". We know that Error 1 is 2, so we can find Error 2 as follows:

Total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench = 16 test tubes + 14 Petri dishes + 7 beakers
Total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench = 37 - 2 (for the extra Petri dishes)
Total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench = 35

Number of items Igor was supposed to place on the lab bench = 16 test tubes + 14 Petri dishes + 7 beakers
Number of items Igor was supposed to place on the lab bench = 37

The difference between the number of items Igor was supposed to place on the lab bench and the number of items he actually placed on the lab bench is the sum of Error 1 and Error 2:

Error 1 + Error 2 = 37 - 35
Error 1 + Error 2 = 2

Since Error 1 is 2, we can find Error 2 as follows:

Error 2 = 2 - Error 1
Error 2 = 2 - 2
Error 2 = 0

However, we know that there is an additional error, so Error 2 must be non-zero. This means that our initial calculation of Error 1 was incorrect, and we need to re-evaluate the situation.

Let's assume that Igor lost 1 beaker instead of forgetting to gather 2 Petri dishes. In that case, the number of beakers Igor was supposed to gather is 6, and the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 28 (16 test tubes, 14 Petri dishes, and 6 beakers). The difference between the number of items Igor was supposed to place on the lab bench and the number of items he actually placed on the lab bench is 1, which means that Igor lost 1 beaker on the way to the lab bench.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Result: \text{Igor lost 1 beaker}",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}
1307," To find out how many screws James will have left over after attaching all the screws to the 4 tables, we first need to determine how many screws are needed for all the tables. Since each table requires 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws for one table is 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws. Therefore, for 4 tables, James will need a total of 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.

Since James has 40 screws, the difference between the number of screws he has and the number of screws needed for the tables will give us the number of screws he has left over.

1309," Let's first find out how much money Alexandra and Kim raised. We know that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so we can represent this relationship as: Kim's fundraising = Alexandra's fundraising + $320

Substituting the given value of Alexandra's fundraising ($430), we get: Kim's fundraising = $430 + $320 = $750

Next, we'll find out how much money Sarah and Maryam raised. We know that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so we can represent this relationship as: Maryam's fundraising = Sarah's fundraising + $400

Substituting the given value of Sarah's fundraising ($300), we get: Maryam's fundraising = $300 + $400 = $700

Now, we have the individual fundraising amounts for all three girls: Alexandra raised $430, Kim raised $750, and Maryam raised $700. To find the total amount raised by all three girls, we simply add their individual fundraising amounts:

1310," Let's denote the running speed of Vanessa as V and the running speed of Aaron as A. We know that Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

A = 2V

We also know that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron in the same amount of time. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and ran for a total distance of 4 miles (since Vanessa ran 4 miles), we have:

4A = 2V * D

where D is the total distance that Vanessa ran. We know that D = 4 miles for Aaron, so:

D = 4 miles
4A = 2V * 4

Now we can substitute A = 2V into the equation:

4(2V) = 2V * 4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

8V = 8V^2

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

V = 1

Now that we know Vanessa's running speed, we can find out how long it took her to run 4 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed

So,

Time = 4 miles / 1 mph = 4 hours

However, we were given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, so we need to convert Vanessa's time to minutes as well. We know that:

1 hour = 60 minutes

So,

4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 240 minutes (or 4 hours) to complete her part of the race. However, since we made an error in our initial calculation, we need to correct it.

The correct calculation is as follows:

We know that Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

A = 2V

We also know that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron in the same amount of time. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and ran for a total distance of 4 miles, we have:

4A = 2V * D

where D is the total distance that Vanessa ran. We know that D = 4 miles for Aaron, so:

D = 4 miles
4A = 2V * 4

Now we can substitute A = 2V into the equation:

4(2V) = 2V * 4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

8V = 8V^2

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

V = 1 / 2

Now that we know Vanessa's running speed is half that of Aaron's, we can find out how long it took her to run 4 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed

So,

Time = 4 miles / (1/2 mph) = 8 miles

However, we were given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, which is equivalent to 1 mile / (1/16 mph) = 16 miles. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, her part of the race was 16 miles * 2 = 32 miles.

We know that:

1 mile = 5280 feet

So,

32 miles = 32 * 5280 feet = 171,840 feet

Now we can find out how long it took Vanessa to run 32 miles at her speed of 1/2 mph:

Time = Distance / Speed

So,

Time = 171,840 feet / (1/2 mph) = 343,680 feet-seconds

Converting feet-seconds to minutes, we get:

343,680 feet-seconds / (60 seconds/foot * 60 minutes/hour * 60 minutes/hour) = 1,132,160 minutes

Dividing by 60 minutes/hour to get hours, we get:

1,132,160 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18,869.3 hours

Finally, we can convert hours to minutes:

18,869.3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1,132,158 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took approximately 1,132,158 minutes (or about 19,196 hours) to complete her part of the race.

Line needed = Length of dock * Line per foot
= 200 feet * 3 feet/foot
= 600 feet

Now, we know that the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. We can subtract this amount from the total amount of line he needs to buy:

Line to buy = Line needed - Line already have

C * 50 = $80
C = $1.6 (cost per watermelon)

Now, we know that the vendor made a 25% profit on each watermelon, so:

1. We know that John had a son named James when he was 19 years old.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who is turning 12 in 3 years.
3. To find Dora's current age, we need to determine how old she will be when she turns 12 in 3 years. We know she is turning 12, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
4. James is twice as old as Dora, so James' age is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
5. John had another son when he was 32 years old.
6. To find the age of the youngest son in 3 years, we need to determine his current age and then add 3 years.
7. We know John was 32 when he had the youngest son, so the youngest son's current age is 32.
8. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

1315," To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we first need to determine how many oranges they can peel in an hour.

We know that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, so her peeling rate is 1 orange / (3 minutes). Jane's peeling rate is 1 orange / (4 minutes).

To find their combined peeling rate, we add their individual rates:

Combined peeling rate = Ana's rate + Jane's rate = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12:

Ana's rate = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}
Jane's rate = \frac{3}{12}

Combined peeling rate = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}

So, they can peel 1 orange every 3 minutes when working together.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges they can peel in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the number of minutes in an hour by the number of minutes it takes them to peel one orange:

Number of oranges peeled in an hour = \frac{60}{3} = 20 oranges

Since they are working together, the number of oranges Ana and Jane will have peeled after an hour is 20. However, we were asked to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane.

Since they are working together and peeling oranges at the same rate, there is no difference in the number of oranges they will have peeled after an hour.
