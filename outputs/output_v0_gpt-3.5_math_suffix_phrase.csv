- Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse.
- She purchased a package of post-it notes.
- She used 220 post-it notes at work.
- She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we can set up an equation:
Total post-it notes = Initial post-it notes + Package post-it notes - Used post-it notes - Remaining post-it notes
Total post-it notes = 80 + x - 220 - 23
Total post-it notes = x - 163

Since the total post-it notes should be a whole number, we know that x must be greater than or equal to 163. However, since Candice had 23 post-it notes remaining, the total post-it notes must be a multiple of 23. Therefore, we can start by adding 23 to 163 until we get a multiple of 23:
163 + 23 = 186
186 + 23 = 209
209 + 23 = 232

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50:
Price per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1:
Price per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower

Since the package of 2 flowers is cheaper per flower, Vincent should buy flowers in packages of 2 for $1.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the better price of $1 for 2 flowers, he would need to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers, which would cost him:
9 packages * $1 = $9

If he were to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50, he would need to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers, which would cost him:

In 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so x + x = 1000

Now, let's calculate how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes. The total cost is $70 and she already has $30, so she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write another equation: W = R + 2.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for R:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation: B - 4(4) = 2(S - 4)

Now, we are given that currently the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation: B - 4(0) = 4(S - 0)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes

Now, let's calculate James' total time for the triathlon:
Jon's total time - 10 minutes (Jon's winning margin) = 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes

Now, let's break down James' total time into the individual components:
Let x be the time James took for the swim.
James took 10% less time for the swim compared to Jon, so:
0.9x = 40 minutes
x = 40 minutes / 0.9
x = 44.44 minutes

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike compared to Jon, so:
80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let y be the time James took for the run.
160 minutes = 44.44 minutes (swim) + 85 minutes (bike) + y minutes (run)

Since the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, it covered a distance of 16 miles (32 miles per hour for 0.5 hours).

For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat 8 bails of hay.

Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of hay for Michael would be 8 bails * $3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has $30 in total.

Therefore, after buying the hay, Michael will have $30 - $24 = $6 in change.

Marissa's production rate = (3/4) * (120 pounds / 2 hours) = 90 pounds per hour

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they make together in an hour:

Total production rate = Ruiz's production rate + Marissa's production rate
Total production rate = 120 pounds / 2 hours + 90 pounds per hour
Total production rate = 60 pounds per hour + 90 pounds per hour
Total production rate = 150 pounds per hour

Since they work for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate pounds they make together in a day is:

In 3 minutes with her arms down, she taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. So, in 3 minutes, she taps her right foot 300 x 3 = 900 times and her left foot 250 x 3 = 750 times. Therefore, the total number of taps with both feet when her arms are down is 900 + 750 = 1650 taps.

Next, we need to calculate how many taps Helga makes with both feet when her arms are raised. In 2 minutes with her arms raised, she taps her right foot 200 times per minute and her left foot 200 times per minute. So, in 2 minutes, she taps her right foot 200 x 2 = 400 times and her left foot 200 x 2 = 400 times. Therefore, the total number of taps with both feet when her arms are raised is 400 + 400 = 800 taps.

Finally, we add the total number of taps with both feet when her arms are down (1650 taps) to the total number of taps with both feet when her arms are raised (800 taps) to find the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet: 1650 + 800 = 2450.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day and the farmer has 3 cows, the total amount of milk produced by his current cows is 5 liters/cow/day * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day more.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow/day = 2 more cows.

Let's assume Lana brews x cups of mint tea in each row. Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, she also brews x cups of chamomile tea in each row.

So, in each row, Lana brews x cups of mint tea and x cups of chamomile tea, totaling 2x cups of tea in each row.

Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we can calculate the total number of cups of mint and chamomile tea in all three rows: 3 * 2x = 6x cups.

Therefore, the total number of cups of mint and chamomile tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Equating the two expressions for the total number of cups of mint and chamomile tea, we get:

6x = 12

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats 10 bananas/day + 4 bananas = 14 bananas/day. In a week, it eats 14 bananas/day * 7 days = 98 bananas/week. 
Together, the first and second monkeys eat 70 bananas/week + 98 bananas/week = 168 bananas/week. 
Since Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas, the third monkey eats 315 bananas - 168 bananas = 147 bananas in a week.

Let's start by finding out how many stickers Luis received from Seth. Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, Luis had half of the stickers Seth had in the beginning.

Let's say Seth had x stickers. Luis received x/2 stickers from Seth.

Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers. 
He gave the remaining x/4 stickers to Kris.

Kris kept 9 stickers, so he received x/4 - 9 stickers.

1152,"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning.

Let's denote the probability of the first ticket winning as P1 and the probability of the second ticket winning as P2. Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, P1 = 20% = 0.2. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win, P2 = 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability that both tickets are winners is given by:
P(both tickets winning) = P1 * P2 = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12

Converting this probability to a percentage:
0.12 * 100% = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

Let x be the number of seashells Carrey collected.
Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2x seashells.
Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected x + 5 seashells.

Now, we know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of what each person collected:
x + 2x + (x + 5) = 27
4x + 5 = 27
4x = 22
x = 5.5

Since we can't have half a seashell, let's adjust our numbers:
Carrey collected 5 seashells.
Carlos collected 2 * 5 = 10 seashells.
Jim collected 5 + 5 = 10 seashells.

Now, to find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide them equally:
Total seashells = 5 + 10 + 10 = 25

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of the two songs together:

Next, we calculate the total cost of the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total cost is (2 devices x $20) + (4 devices x $20) = $40 + $80 = $120.

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices. Linus sold 2 devices for $40 each and 4 devices for $40 each, so the total revenue is (2 devices x $40) + (4 devices x $40) = $80 + $160 = $240.

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles are needed to cover the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since 5 bottles are needed for 1 person, we multiply 5 by 2300 to get 11500 bottles.

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy the demand. Hortex can already produce 4200 bottles per day, so we subtract this from the total needed bottles: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

1/4 of 80 square meters = 80/4 = 20 square meters

So, Abraham sold a total of 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land.

Now, let's calculate how much money he earned from selling the first half and the second quarter of his land:

60% of 400 apartments is 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.

From the given information, we know that:
\( R = W = P \) (equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint)
\( Y = \frac{1}{2}(R + W + P) \) (half the mural is yellow)
\( R + W + P + Y = 12 \) (total amount of paint used is 12 pints)

Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
\( 3R + Y = 12 \)
\( Y = 12 - 3R \)

Substitute the third equation into the second equation:
\( 12 - 3R = \frac{1}{2}(3R) \)
