0,"The paper discusses the importance of considering ensemble behavior in the analysis of chaotic deterministic ratchets. It presents a heuristic rule that current reversals are associated with bifurcations in an ensemble, which is consistent with the results of mateos. The paper also discusses the importance of factorizing issues of size, location, spread, and transience in computing the current, and the dependence on ensemble characteristics is most critical near certain bifurcation points. The paper concludes that the heuristic characteristics hold for single-trajectory behavior, but not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation, nor vice versa. The paper also discusses the open question of whether the heuristic rules are valid or not, and provides examples of situations where these rules do not seem to apply.",0,{'n_sentences': 8}

42,"The text discusses the use of constrained density functional theory (CDFT) to study the adsorption of organic molecules on a 2D (2D) metal, specifically focusing on the charge transfer energies between a benzene molecule and a graphene sheet. The study involves three different configurations of the benzene molecule adsorbed on the graphene sheet: the hollow configuration, where all carbon atoms of the benzene ring are placed exactly above the carbon atoms of the graphene sheet, and the stack configuration, where alternate carbon atoms of the benzene molecule are placed directly above the carbon atoms of the graphene sheet. The CDFT approach is used to calculate the charge transfer energies, which are found to decrease as the distance between the molecule and the graphene sheet increases. The results show that the charge transfer energies are weakly affected by the presence of other molecules, and the presence of defects in the graphene sheet does not significantly alter the charge transfer energies.

The study also suggests that Leo I has a conspicuous hb, which is not seen in the CMDs, and that the presence of anomalous cepheids in the CMDs indicates that star formation has proceeded in a more or less continuous way in the central part of the galaxy, with possible intensity variations over time but no big time gaps between successive bursts. The study concludes that the width of the Leo I rgb can be accounted for by the dispersion of its stellar population, and therefore, the metallicity dispersion could be negligible.

136,"The paper presents a new method for reading out the qubit state by current measurement in the doublet blockade regime, and analyzes the qubit dynamics in the presence of decoherence processes caused by interaction with the electrodes. The authors assume that each dot contains one spin and the qubit is encoded in the doublet subspace. The qubit states have been controlled by the applied gate potentials which break the triangular symmetry. The calculations have been performed in the heisenberg model where the exchange couplings are modified by the orientation of the electric field with respect to the triangular axes. The qubit is read out using the electric transport through tqd and the doublet blockade effect. The method is compatible with pure electrical manipulations and the spin-to-charge conversion is not necessary. The doublet blockade effect is related with an asymmetry of tunnel rates between the doublet states and the electrodes. For some specific symmetry of tqd, one of the doublet states is a dark one and the electron transport is blocked. The qubit is also considered to read out in the linear tqd. The authors also consider the time dependent electron transport in the doublet blockade regime. The qubit dynamics is analyzed in the presence of leakage processes from the doublet to two electron states. The authors present the driven case where the mixing parameter between the doublet state is time dependent. The doublet blockade is partially removed and one can observe strong rabi oscillations.

The authors present a fast and accurate method to compute the inclusive 2p-2h response functions, which are essential for the description of neutrino oscillation experiments. The method involves using an effective propagator to approximate the integrand of the 2p-2h response, which is then evaluated numerically. The authors validate the method by comparing its results with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of the rfg model. The method is particularly useful for computing the 2p-2h neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux, and it can be of great help in implementing the 2p-2h models in current Monte Carlo codes.

The model describes quarks and gluons that oscillate with a universal frequency, independent of flavor mass, inside closed universes, as well as photons that freely travel through flat space-time. The model's flavor-independent oscillations are described by a symmetric second-order tensor field, which is used to define the metric for flat space-time. The model's conformally symmetric nature is preserved through the introduction of two scalar fields that spontaneously break the xmath7 symmetry down to xmath8 and xmath9 symmetry, respectively.

The model's flavor-independent oscillations are also used to describe the size of the mass of the scalar field that gives rise to confinement.

303,"The invention relates to a waste fuel burner that burns wood waste to produce clean, low-temperature heat. The burner includes a primary combustion chamber with a conical pile of waste fuel fed from below, with preheated underfire air percolating up through the pile in controlled amounts. The volatile gases driven off the pile by heat generated by the oxidation of the fixed carbon on the surface of the pile are partially oxidized by additional combustion air introduced tangentially with a very vigorous swirl in a first or primary combustion chamber with the total amount of combustion air admitted to the primary chamber being maintained at less than stoichiometric proportions so that the temperature in the primary chamber remains lower than the necessary to melt the natural ash, dirt or other inorganic substances in the fuel. The additional or swirl air is introduced in an amount necessary to maintain a steady temperature at the exit of the primary chamber and is dependent upon the moisture content and type of fuel. The swirl air also forces particulate out of the gas stream leaving the primary chamber. The volatile gases are discharged from the throat of the primary combustion chamber around an air cooled disc or flame holder which forces the gases, and any entrained particulate matter, out to the walls of the throat, thereby causing such entrained matter, if any, to centrifugally separate and fall back into the primary chamber. The secondary chamber is also provided with a side wall, roof, outlet, and refractory lining. The volatile gases pass through discharge 12 from the primary chamber, work their way past an air cooled horizontal, disc-shaped flame holder, and enter the secondary chamber. The secondary chamber is surrounded by an inner vortex of upward spiralling flame and a secondary vortex of downward spiralling combustion air.

369,"The text discusses the use of high-dielectric oxide materials, particularly Pb/Bi-containing oxides, in semiconductor circuitry. It explains that Pb/Bi oxide materials are convenient due to their low annealing temperatures and desirable properties in small grains. The integration of non-SiO2-based oxides directly or indirectly on Si is difficult because of Si's reactivity with oxygen. The deposition of non-SiO2-based oxides has generally resulted in the formation of a SiO2 or silicate layer at the Si//oxide interface. This layer is amorphous and has a low dielectric constant. These properties degrade the usefulness of non-SiO2-based oxides with Si. High-dielectric constant oxide (e.g., a ferroelectric oxide) can have a large dielectric constant, a large spontaneous polarization, and a large electrooptic properties. Ferroelectrics with a large dielectric constant can be used to form high density capacitors but can not be deposited directly on Si because of the reaction of Si to form a low dielectric constant layer. Such capacitor dielectrics have been deposited on inert metals such as Pt, but even Pt or Pd must be separated from the Si with one or more conductive buffer layers. The large spontaneous polarization of ferroelectrics when integrated directly on a semiconductor can also be used to form a non-volatile, non-destructive readout, field effect memory. Ferroelectrics also have interesting electrooptic applications where epitaxial films are preferred in order to reduce loss due to scattering from grain boundaries and to align the oxide in order to maximize its anisotropic properties. The integration of oxides on GaAs is even harder than Si because the GaAs is unstable in O2 at the normal growth temperatures of high-dielectric constant oxide (450°C.-700°C). An epitaxial Ge layer on Si provides a good buffer layer which is compatible with Si and also many oxides. Unlike other buffer layers, Ge is a semiconductor (it can also be doped to provide a reasonably highly conductive layer) and is compatible with Si process technology. The epitaxial growth of Ge on top of the ferroelectric or high-dielectric constant oxide is also much easier than Si which makes it possible to form three dimensional epitaxial structures. The Ge buffer layer can be epitaxially gown on the Si substrate allowing the high dielectric constant oxide to be epitaxially gown on the Ge and hence epitaxially aligned",0,{'n_sentences': 6}

The algorithm balances the cells by determining the resistive circuitry activation time and deactivating the resistive circuitry when the activation time has expired. Once the resistive circuitry is deactivated, the algorithm determines whether the battery pack charge time has expired. If no, the algorithm returns to the previous step. If yes, the algorithm disables the battery charger and deactivates the resistive circuitry. The algorithm then determines whether the battery pack charge time has expired. If no, the algorithm returns to the previous step. If yes, the algorithm disables the battery charger and deactivates the resistive circuitry. The algorithm then determines whether the battery pack charge time has expired. If no, the algorithm returns to the previous step. If yes, the algorithm disables the battery charger and deactivates the resistive circuitry. The algorithm then determines whether the battery pack charge time has expired.

The first initiative, undertaken in that year, was the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR) project, which aimed to create an electronic interface that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA and DOD health facilities to access data from any of the other agency's health information systems. The interface was expected to compile requested patient information in a virtual record that could be displayed on a user's computer screen. In our reviews of the GCPR project, we determined that the lack of a lead entity, clear mission, and detailed planning to achieve that mission made it difficult to monitor progress, identify project risks, and develop appropriate contingency plans. In 2001, we recommended that the participating agencies (1) designate a lead entity with final decision-making authority and establish a clear line of authority for the GCPR project and (2) create comprehensive and coordinated plans that included an agreed-upon mission and clear goals, objectives, and performance measures, to ensure that the agencies could share comprehensive, meaningful, accurate, and secure patient health care data. In 2002, we recommended that the participating agencies revise the original goals and objectives of the project to align with their current strategy, commit the executive support necessary to adequately manage the project, and ensure that it followed sound project management principles. VA and DOD took specific measures in response to our recommendations for enhancing overall management and accountability of the project. By July 2002, VA and DOD had revised their strategy and had made progress toward being able to electronically share patient health data.

443,"OSC, an office within Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt, has an agreement with ARC, an office within Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt, to provide contracting support for a fee. As a member of the Treasury franchise fund, ARC does not receive direct appropriated funds, but instead relies on revenue from its federal agency customers to pay organizational expenses. The agreement between ARC and OSC is a mechanism for interagency contracting. This type of fee-for-service procurement process generally involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services. The requiring agency officials determine the goods or services needed and, if applicable, prepare a statement of work, sometimes with the assistance of the ordering agency. The contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or order is properly awarded or issued (including any required competition) and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements. If contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer’s representative—generally an official at the requiring agency with relevant technical expertise—is normally designated by the contracting officer to monitor the contractor’s performance and serve as the liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor. While interagency contracting can offer the benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness, this approach needs to be effectively managed. Due to the challenges associated with interagency contracts, we recently designated interagency contracting as a governmentwide high-risk area. As authorized by OSC’s appropriation, OSC may use 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants. Section 3109 permits agencies, when authorized by an appropriation or other statute, to acquire the temporary or intermittent services of experts or consultants. Under the statute, appointments of experts and consultants may be made without regard to competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements. Individuals appointed under this authority may not be paid in excess of the highest rate payable for a GS-15 unless a higher rate is expressly provided for by statute or an appropriation. Under section 3109, OPM is responsible for prescribing criteria governing circumstances in which it is appropriate to employ an expert or consultant and for prescribing criteria for setting pay. Section 3109 of title 5 and OPM’s implementing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 304 provide for broad discretion in the appointment of experts and consultants.

The MHSS has a demonstration project to train clinical psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication, which has increased the number of MHSS mental health care providers who may prescribe drugs. However, the PDP implementation faced several problems, including the lack of a clearly defined purpose for prescribing psychologists, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified selection criteria, repeated changes in the classroom curriculum, delays in granting prescribing privileges, and unresolved issues involving supervision. The PDP did not clearly define the role of prescribing psychologists in the MHSS. The ACNP’s PDP evaluation panel noted in 1992 that the project’s goal “to train psychologists to issue appropriate medication under certain circumstances” was “rich with ambiguities.” The project was structured and revised without specifying the prescribing psychologists’ duties and responsibilities, types of clinical settings or facilities their skills would be best suited for, types of psychotropic medication psychologists would be qualified to prescribe, and level of supervision they would require.

In September 1995, after the project had operated for 4 years, the ACNP panel suggested that DOD define clearly how PDP graduates could be used; this did not take place. DOD had difficulty recruiting PDP participants throughout the project. The recruiting goal, which was not met, was six psychologists for each PDP class. Since the project started in 1991, 13 psychologists have participated. Seven have completed it. Three have dropped out, and three are expected to finish their clinical experience in June 1997 (see table 3). Those who dropped out did so for various reasons: One left the military.

481,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large, deployable, infrared-optimized space telescope designed for a 5-year mission to find the first stars and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their current formation. JWST is being developed by Northrop Grumman, Harris, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). The project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module are integrated, referred to as OTIS, is not considered an element by NASA, but it is categorized as such for ease of discussion. JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope as well as collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. The project is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining. However, all of JWST’s elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the project’s critical path, potentially reducing schedule reserve further. This is a tenuous position for the project given that it must complete five integration and test periods, three of which have not yet started. Testing can uncover problems that can be difficult or time-consuming to resolve, thereby adding schedule risk to the project and the unusual complexity of JWST further heightens these risks. To achieve mission success, the project will have to address over 100 technical risks and ensure that the project’s potential areas for mission failure are fully tested and understood before project launch in October 2018. Overall project schedule reserve, currently at 8.75 months, remains above Goddard requirements and the project’s plan—which was set above the Goddard standard at the replan in 2011 and included more reserve than required. However, as shown in figure 4 below, the use of schedule reserve on any element or major subsystem—two of which have entered integration and testing phases—may reduce the overall project schedule reserve. While some use of schedule reserve is expected, the proximity of each element and major subsystem schedule to the critical path means that the project must prioritize the mitigations when problems occur. Overall, the project has used more than 30 percent of its schedule reserve established at the time of the replan in 2011 to address technical challenges.

483,"The major requirements for the protection of personal privacy by federal agencies are specified in two laws, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) also addresses the protection of personal information in the context of securing federal agency information and information systems. The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies’ collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act describes a “record” as any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her name or another personal identifier. It also defines “system of records” as a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public by a “system-of-records notice”: that is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, among other things, the type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is collected, the intended “routine” uses of data, and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personal information. Among other provisions, the act also requires agencies to define and limit themselves to specific predefined purposes. For example, the act requires that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an individual’s rights or benefits under a federal program. The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as the Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S. government advisory committee; these principles were intended to address what the committee termed a poor level of protection afforded to privacy under contemporary law. Since that time, the Fair Information Practices have been widely adopted as a standard benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of privacy protections. Attachment 2 contains a summary of the widely used version of the Fair Information Practices adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 1980. The E-Government Act of 2002 strives to enhance protection for personal information in government information systems and information collections by requiring that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). A PIA is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system. More specifically, according to Office of Management",0,{'n_sentences': 10}

540,"The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP programs are briefly described, with Medicare being the nation's health insurance program for persons aged 65 and over and certain disabled persons. In FY2008, the program will cover an estimated 44.6 million persons (37.3 million aged and 7.3 million disabled) at a total cost of $456.3 billion. Federal costs (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will total $389.7 billion. In FY2007, federal Medicare spending will represent approximately 13% of the total federal budget and 3% of GDP. Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that it is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI); Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI); Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA); and Part D (the new prescription drug benefit added by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, P.L. 108-173 ). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Department of HHS. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services, as well as long-term care, to more than 63 million people at an estimated cost to the federal and state governments of roughly $317 billion. Each state designs and administers its own version of Medicaid under broad federal rules. State variability in eligibility and covered services, and how those services are reimbursed and delivered, is the rule rather than the exception. In the federal budget, Medicaid is an entitlement program that constitutes a large share of mandatory spending. Federal Medicaid spending is open-ended, with total outlays dependent on the spending levels of state Medicaid programs. SCHIP is authorized under Title XXI of the Social Security Act. In general, this program allows states to cover targeted low-income children with no health insurance in families with income that is above Medicaid eligibility levels. As of July 2006, the highest upper-income eligibility limit under SCHIP had reached 350% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in one state.

It mentions that Cuba has remained on the list since 1982 and that there are four other countries on the list—Iran, Syria, Sudan, and North Korea. The text also notes that the Administration's rationale for keeping Cuba on the list is based on strong anti-American statements made by Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials, while critics argue that Cuba's history of supporting revolutionary movements and governments in Latin America and Africa is a holdover of the Cold War. The text concludes by suggesting that there should be a tiered approach with sanctions calibrated to the degree of support for terrorism, while others believe that any level of support for terrorism is unacceptable and must be met with strong sanctions.",0,{'n_sentences': 6}
544,"The AMT, a tax alternative, provides a broader tax base than the regular tax. It includes various provisions, such as not only business provisions but also certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions. After an exemption of $45,000 for joint returns and $33,750 for single returns, the first $175,000 is taxed at 26% and the remainder at 28%. Exemptions are phased out. The AMT base is broader than the regular tax base, but there are many provisions that are not included in its base, notably the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax exempt bonds. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation. The AMT tax liability is higher than the regular tax liability. The AMT is a growing tax alternative, and its growth is expected to increase the number of taxpayers covered and revenue cost. The AMT will become increasingly important in the years to come, and any tax cut that reduces regular tax liabilities and does not also alter the AMT will interact with the AMT in two ways: it will increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit, and it will cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families.",1,{'n_sentences': 9}
545,"The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate are tasked with drafting bills to provide annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and six small related agencies. The THUD appropriations bill generally funds DOT. The department is primarily a grant-making and regulatory organization. Its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation, providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways, transit, airport, and intercity passenger rail infrastructure, while overseeing safety in all modes of transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exceptional among DOT's large sub-agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the U.S. air traffic control system. In support of that task, it employs over 80% of DOT's total workforce, roughly 46,000 of DOT's approximately 56,000 employees. The Surface Transportation Board, formerly an agency of DOT, was made independent of DOT in 2015 legislation, and now appears in Title III of the THUD bill.",0,{'n_sentences': 5}
546,"The United States and India have established a global partnership through increased cooperation on economic issues, energy and environment, democracy and development, non-proliferation and security, and high-technology and space. The U.S. policy is to isolate Iran and ensure its nuclear program is used for purely civilian purposes. India-Iran relations have traditionally been positive and, in January 2003, the two countries launched a ""strategic partnership"" with the signing of the ""New Delhi Declaration"" and seven other substantive agreements. Indian leaders regularly speak of ""civilizational ties"" between the two countries, a reference to the interactions of Persian and Indus Valley civilizations over a period of millennia. As U.S. relations with India grow deeper and more expansive in the new century, some in Washington believe that New Delhi's friendship with Tehran could become a significant obstacle to further development of U.S.-India ties.

548,"In October 2000, a coalition of democratic parties defeated Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in presidential elections, overturning a regime that had plunged the country into bloody conflicts in the region, economic decline, and international isolation in the 1990s. Serbia has held largely free and fair elections, according to international observers. A new constitution adopted in 2006 marked an improvement over the earlier, Socialist-era one. However, the global economic crisis dealt a setback to Serbia's economy. Organized crime and high-level corruption remain very serious problems. Serbia has set integration in the European Union as its key foreign policy goal, but its prospects have been clouded by concerns of some EU countries that it has not done enough to normalize relations with its former Kosovo province, which declared independence in 2008. U.S.-Serbian relations, although positive in many respects, have also been negatively affected by the leading role played by the United States in promoting Kosovo's independence. Serbia's most recent parliamentary, presidential, and local elections were held on May 6, 2012. In the parliamentary vote, a coalition of parties led by the nationalist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won 73 seats in the 250-seat Serbian parliament. A pro-EU coalition led by the Democratic Party (DS) won 68 seats. In the biggest surprise of the vote, a coalition led by the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) won 45 seats, significantly more than expected. The strongly nationalist Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) won 20 seats, as did a coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party, which favors a less nationalist approach than the DS. The United Regions of Serbia group won 16 seats. Most of the remaining seats were won by representatives of national minorities. In the presidential election, outgoing President Tadic of the DS faced Tomislav Nikolic from the SNS, as well as candidates from smaller parties. Tadic took first place with 26.7% of the vote. Nikolic came in a close second with 25.5%. The other candidates trailed far behind. As no candidate received a majority, a runoff election was held between Tadic and Nikolic on May 20. In a result that surprised almost all observers, Nikolic defeated Tadic, winning 49.55% to Tadic's 47.3%. Voter turnout was 46.3",0,{'n_sentences': 6}

The Court also held that a dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Court's decision in Jardines, Harris, and Bailey involved the question of whether a trained narcotics-detection dog's sniff at the front door of a suspected marijuana grow house is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause.

It would also require insurers to provide coverage for essential benefits and to charge the same premium regardless of whether the plan is purchased through an exchange (described below), the offeror, or an insurance agent. The bill would require all new health benefits plans offered in the individual and small group markets to be qualified health benefit plans that meet the insurance rating reforms and essential benefits package requirements specified in the bill.",0,{'n_sentences': 2}
553,"In an effort to expand health coverage, 35 states have established high risk health insurance pools. These programs target individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market, primarily due to preexisting health conditions. High risk pools (HRPs) generally cover people who have sought health coverage in the individual (nongroup) market, but have been denied coverage, received quotes from insurers that are higher than the premiums offered by the high risk pools, or received offers from insurers that permanently exclude coverage of preexisting health conditions. Many states also use their high risk pools to comply with the portability and guaranteed availability provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-191 ). For eligible individuals moving from the group to nongroup market, HIPAA requires state-licensed health insurers to make coverage available to such individuals, and prohibits exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions. To enforce these rules, states are given a choice. They may either enforce the HIPAA individual market guarantees (""federal fallback""), or establish an ""acceptable alternative state mechanism,"" such as a high risk health insurance pool. In general, state high risk pools tend to enroll a small percentage of the uninsured. For example, approximately 200,000 individuals were enrolled in the 34 high risk pools in operation in 2008. In contrast, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that nearly 4 million additional persons were potentially eligible for enrollment. However, such limited enrollment reflects, in part, the narrow focus of these pools: individuals with preexisting health conditions, who do not have access to public or group health insurance, and seek coverage in the private, non-group market.",0,{'n_sentences': 10}

In three states, more than 95% of state and local government employees are covered by Social Security: Arizona (95.3%), New York (96.7%), and Vermont (97.9%). In two states, fewer than 5% of state and local government employees work in positions covered by Social Security: Massachusetts (4.1%) and Ohio (2.5%). States in which less than half of state and local government employees are in positions covered by Social Security include California (43.6%), Colorado (29.1%), Louisiana (27.9%), Nevada (17.6%), and Texas (47.9%). The 1935 Social Security Act did not extend Social Security coverage to state and local government workers.

In 1954, Congress extended voluntary coverage to employees who were already covered by pension plans, effective starting in 1955, if a majority of employees who were members of a pension system voted in favor of Social Security coverage. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by former Senator Pete Domenici and Dr. Alice Rivlin, recommended that all newly hired state and local government employees be covered under the Social Security system, beginning in 2020, to increase the universality of the program. In addition, the Bipartisan Policy Center recommended that state and local pension plans be required to share data with SSA until the transition is complete.

The eligibility and benefit provisions of TAARA apply to all workers certified for TAA after the law's enactment. The law also had retroactivity provisions and, in some cases, workers who were parts of groups certified prior to the 2015 reauthorization may be covered under the TAARA provisions. TAA was jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and cooperating state agencies. DOL makes group eligibility determinations, allocates funds to cooperating state agencies, and oversees grantees. Individual benefits are provided through state workforce systems and state unemployment insurance systems. TAA is funded by mandatory appropriations. Typically, Congress appropriates a single sum that supports all TAA activities. DOL then allocates these funds to various program activities. Under TAARA, funding for training and reemployment services is capped at $450 million per year. These funds are allotted to the states via a grant allocation formula that considers past and anticipated program usage. States may expend training and reemployment service funds in the year of allotment or in either of the next two fiscal years. Training subsidies are states' primary expenditures out of their reemployment services funding. TAA is a direct spending (also referred to as ""mandatory"") program and subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended.

In FY2018, Congress appropriated $790 million for the TAA for Workers programs. Of this amount, $450 million was for training and reemployment services and the remaining $340 million was for income support and wage insurance. The entire $790 million appropriation was subject to 6.6% sequestration ($52.14 million).

605,"The study demonstrates that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical cvvh filter and under clinical conditions removes endothelial cells (huvec passage 46; clonetics, walkersville, md) from a modelled patient's circulation. The data presented here demonstrate that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical cvvh filter and under clinical conditions removes endothelial cells from a modelled patient's circulation. The study also shows that the observed emp clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon, which would explain the relatively constant emp concentration from 40 to 70 minutes and low dialysate emp levels. The relative volume of human circulation ( ~5 l ) to cvvh circuit ( ~200 ml ) is much higher in the clinical condition as compared to our model ( 300 and 170 ml , respectively ). While this would not affect a steady state of dialysis, a saturable filter emp - binding would be required to achieve a lower steady state emp concentration. The low dialysate emp level and plateauing circulation emp level beyond 40 minutes suggest that emp sequestration occurs within the cvvh filter or tubing and that this is a saturable phenomenon. Frequent changing of the cvvh filter is a logical step that may overcome this limitation. Additionally, more efficient and selective emps clearance can be realized by conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to commercially available specialty cvvh filters (aethlon adapt). This approach would provide more selective binding sites and higher affinity for circulating emps. By combining a selective filter with convection and pressure gradients, emp clearance could likely be substantially prolonged. Clinical data generally support the protective role of cvvh in ali management. A clinical randomized trial and several animal trials demonstrate that the achievement of negative fluid balance is associated with improved outcomes from ali (6265)(67,68).",0,{'n_sentences': 9}

643,"The text discusses the effects of glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve atrophy. It highlights that multiple factors, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure, are associated with glaucoma. Investigations indicate that mller cells, which are major types of glial cells in the mammalian retina, play a crucial role in retinal function. The study found that mller cells not only support and nourish retinal neurons but also contribute to multiple pathological retinal diseases such as glaucoma. The research suggests that mller cells can exacerbate retinal damage by releasing cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The study also indicates that increased glial production of TNF-α contributes to neurodegeneration in glaucoma. The findings suggest that aaa treatment, a compound that inhibits glial production of TNF-α, may protect against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (Aoh).",0,{'n_sentences': 9}

647,"The role of endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (dx / ha) in treating pediatric vesicoureteral reflux (vur) has expanded as an alternative to open surgery. The technique has been FDA-approved since 2001 for grade 24 vur in single systems with no accompanying urological malformations in children above one year of age. The technique has been popularized with surgeons and parents alike. Reports of expanded use to patients of all ages and grades of vur even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies are published worldwide. The initial success rate was quoted as 68% and is still mentioned on the current website. The original subureteric injection technique (sting) has evolved to the intraureteric injection technique introduced by the atlanta group. Using this hydrodistention-implantation technique (hit), the authors reported success rates of 89%. However, the reported worldwide success rates differ considerably (55%89% [7,8]). The radiographic success rate for patients and renal units after the first injection was 75% for both groups. The intraoperative cystogram was developed to detect occult vur in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) after a negative standard voiding cystogram. The detection of de novo vur in patients with preoperative unilateral refluxing vur was found intraoperatively in 27 ru (23% of 116 patients). The high-pressure intraoperative cystogram (group 1) was performed in 86 rus and the standard pic (group 2) in 91 rus. There was no statistically significant difference between groups 1 and 2 for the detection of de novo vur. The dx / ha deposits were seen in all cases. At 2 months, the intraoperative standard vcug detected 20 ru (23% of 116 patients) to be positive for vur in group 1 and 16 ru (18% of 116 patients) positive for vur in group 2. Overall, the grade of vur, age, gender, and amount of deflux injected did not influence the result. The endoscopic injection of dx / ha is an attractive management alternative for parents. When presenting the surgical options, all parents are enthusiastic about the minimal invasive nature of the procedure with low complication possibilities and fast recovery times",0,{'n_sentences': 9}

The authors also identify a quantitative theoretical model that predicts the extent to which complex metabolic interactions emerge from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network. They use synthetic genetic interactions to infer properties of the metabolic network, such as the investment benefits of cooperative growth. The model also predicts that synthetic genetic interactions can be used to infer biochemical reaction rates through flux balance analysis.

703,"<p>Source: The above text discusses the prevalence of preeclampsia, a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, and its association with proteinuria. The study found that severe preeclampsia is often associated with hypoalbuminemia, which may serve as an indicator of its severity. Hypoalbuminemia is caused by systemic small vessel spasm, increased secretion of angiotensin, and damaged and increased permeability of vascular endothelial cells, leading to a large number of proteins and liquid leaking in tissue clearance and a loss of plasma proteins. This intravascular dehydration may accelerate the appearance of intravascular lesions, which is thought to be a predisposing factor of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet (hellp) syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The study also found that the reduction of hepatic blood flow due to the production of albumin is decreased in pregnant women with preeclampsia. The study evaluated maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with preeclampsia according to the different value of albumin (25 g/l and < 25). The results showed that severe preeclampsia is a significant risk factor for severe hypertension, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes. The study also found that the presence of shp has been associated with increased risk of severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta. The study suggests that the pathophysiologic mechanisms of preeclampsia are unclear, and the leading theory is that defects in placental implantation and function ultimately display as the development of preeclampsia. The study also found that the percentage of cs in shp was higher than in mhp, and the incidence of abnormal liver or renal function in shp was significantly higher than in mhp.

732,"Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which are converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by cellular superoxide dismutases (SODs). Oxidative modification of cysteine residues by H2O2 leads to the formation of sulphenic acid (SOH) and disulfide (ss) or sulfenyl amide (sn) bonds, changing protein function. Mitochondrial ROS generation is essential for the propagation of cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorgenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria and ROS generation play key roles in cellular differentiation programs.

752,"The text discusses recent advancements in molecular biology and microscopy technologies that have enhanced our understanding of the higher-order folding of the genome. It highlights the dynamic nature of chromatin, which is essential for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. The genome is folded into chromatin territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), with specific long-range looping interactions occurring. Each of these structures can be dynamically regulated during development and perturbations in these folding units are associated with multiple diseases and cancer. One interesting feature revealed by fine mapping of the genome's folding is the tad structures, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size. Tads are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions. The replication timing, presence of histone modifications, and expression of genes inside a tad are highly correlated. However, the underlying features that generate invariant tad boundaries remain unknown. In human cells, tad boundaries have been associated with the enrichment of ctcf, cohesin, dnase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and the timing of replication domains. Brg1, a major atpase subunit of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex, is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions, as well as for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions. The relationship between brg1 loss and tad boundaries has been demonstrated, suggesting that brg1 may play a role in regulating nucleosome occupancy and possibly ctcf localization. The results of Dixon et al. suggest that brg1 loss may disrupt chromatin accessibility and prevent long-range interactions surpassing the boundary. The mechanism of brg1 loss may also occur at regions where other chromatin organizers (e.g., cohesin) are bound.",0,{'n_sentences': 9}

The clinical picture includes a decline in visual acuity, pain, contrast sensitivity, dyschromatopsia, and changes in the visual field. The main aim of this study was to determine the onset of optic neuritis as the first clinical presentation. The study also analyzed the role and significance of morphometric changes in the optic nerve and visual field by analyzing parameters of OCT and PCOM in these patients. One of the aims was to determine the efficiency of pulse corticosteroid therapy in those patients. The clinical, retrospective study was conducted at the eye clinic and the neurological clinic in Sarajevo University Clinical Centre (SUC) at the time of the March 2009-2011. The study showed that optic neuritis was most often present in patients aged 18 to 30 years. The first clinical manifestation of MS in our sample statistically significant tests (x=9.7, p=0.01) confirmed that optic neuritis is one of the first clinical manifestations of MS. The study group described the changes of visual functions in MS patients, which usually present as a decline in vision, blurring, decline in contrast sensitivity, color vision disturbances, and disturbances in the visual field (1-5). In their studies, Allanorey and Deretzi G confirmed the genetic impact on MS development as an autoimmune disease in some families. Studies were performed to analyze the influence of stress, viral and bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary and gastrointestinal systems on the appearance and occurrence of MS exacerbations (7, 8). The incidence of MS was highest in patients aged 18-30 years. The ratio of the incidence of occurrence of MS ranged from 1.9:1 to 3.6:1 in favor of women (9). A large number of studies confirm the MS and onset at a younger age and more often in women (1, 2, 5, 10). Balashov K. finds a higher incidence of MS in spring months in patients without demyelinating lesions, which has been observed in our past practice too, and which could be an aim of our future studies (11).

This approach was first described by Delorme in 2001 and later described by de Leval in 2003. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence, including the retropubic, outside-in, and inside-out transobturator mus procedures. The anatomical trajectories of both approaches were compared using ct scan image analysis, revealing that both approaches lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior. The in-out mus tape was more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the out-in mus tape. The cadaveric study compared the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches, allowing for a comparison between 10 independent in-out and 10 out-in transobturator mus trajectories. The findings were counter-intuitive as the exit points of both devices at the skin suggested the opposite. The three-dimensional ct images revealed that the mus tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior. The in-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach, which seemed to follow a more horizontal, flatter trajectory (122 versus 142). These findings were counter-intuitive as the exit points of both devices at the skin would suggest the opposite.
