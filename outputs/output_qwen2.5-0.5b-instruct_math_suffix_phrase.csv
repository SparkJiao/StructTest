0,"To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market every day, we need to calculate the total number of eggs laid by her ducks and then find out how many of those eggs she sells at the market.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks in a day:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
- She bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 muffins.

So, the total number of eggs laid in a day is:
\[ 16 \text{ (daily eggs)} + 3 \text{ (breakfast eggs)} + 4 \text{ (muffins)} = 23 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market. Since she sells the remainder of the eggs at the market, we subtract the number of eggs she eats from the total number of eggs:
\[ 23 \text{ (total eggs)} - 3 \text{ (breakfast eggs)} = 20 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 20 eggs at the farmers' market:
\[ 20 \text{ eggs} \times \$2 \text{ per egg} = \$40 \]

Therefore, Janet makes \(\boxed{40}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1,"To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. **Blue Fiber:**
   - The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber:**
   - The robe requires half the amount of white fiber that the blue fiber requires.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

3. **Total Bolts:**
   - To find the total number of bolts needed, we add the number of blue and white bolts together.
   - Total bolts = Blue bolts + White bolts = \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).

Thus, the total number of bolts required for the robe is \(\boxed{3}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
2,"Josh's house was initially worth $80,000. He then spent $50,000 on repairs, increasing the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the original value:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives us the new value:

\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh's profit is the difference between the new value and the original value:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Original value} = 200,000 - 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}

\[ B = 33 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the high heels as \( H \) dollars. The problem states that the high heels together cost $5 less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + H = 5 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation, we get:

Let's define:
- \( G \) as the number of gold coins.
- \( S \) as the number of silver coins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the second equation:

37,"To determine how many lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John spent on the video games.
2. Determine how much money John had initially.
3. Calculate how much money John had left after buying the video games.
4. Find out how much money John had initially by subtracting the amount spent on the video games from the total amount he had left.
5. Determine how many lego sets John had initially by dividing the amount of money he had left by the price of each lego set.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. John spent $20 on each of the 8 video games. So, the total amount spent on the video games is:
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. John had $5 left after buying the video games. So, the total amount of money he had initially is:
   \[
   160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. John had $13 in lego sets initially. Let \( x \) be the number of lego sets he still has. The total amount of money he had initially can also be expressed as:
   \[
   13 + 165 = 178 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. To find out how many lego sets John had initially, we solve for \( x \) in the equation:
   \[
   13 + 165 = 178
   \]
   \[
   13 + 165 - x = 178
   \]
   \[
   178 - 13 = 165 - x
   \]
   \[
   165 - x = 178
   \]
   \[
   x = 165 - 178
   \]
   \[
   x = -13

38,"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide that distance by the number of days he runs.

1. **Calculate the total distance John runs in a week:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.
   - He runs 3 days a week.
   - He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days.
   - Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is \(3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ minutes/hour} = 90 \text{ minutes}\).
   - The distance he runs on the other two days is \(2 \times 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Adding these together, the total distance he runs in a week is \(90 \text{ minutes} + 180 \text{ minutes} = 270 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Convert the total distance from minutes to miles:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 270 minutes to miles by dividing by 60: \(270 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4.5 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Calculate the running speed:**
   - The total distance John runs in a week is 4.5 miles.
   - He runs 3 days a week.

46,"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of post-it notes before the purchase:**
   Candice started with 80 post-it notes.

2. **Total number of cups of coffee she placed notes on:**
   She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.

3. **Total number of post-it notes placed on coffee cups:**
   Since she placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups, the total number of post-it notes placed on coffee cups is:
   \[
   220 \text{ post-it notes}
   \]

4. **Total number of post-it notes after the purchase:**
   After purchasing the package of Post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

5. **Total number of post-it notes before the purchase:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased. The total number of post-it notes before the purchase is the sum of the post-it notes she had before the purchase and the post-it notes she placed on coffee cups:
   \[
   80 + 220 + x = 300 + x
   \]

6. **Total number of post-it notes after the purchase:**
   After the purchase, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of post-it notes before the purchase is:
   \[
   300 + x = 23
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   300 + x = 23
   \]
   Subtract 300 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 23 - 300
   \]
   \[
   x = -277
   \]

Since the number of post-it notes cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the given information and the steps followed, the calculation shows that the total number of post-it notes before the purchase is 300, and after the purchase, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. This implies that the total number of post-it notes before the purchase is 300, and the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 23.

Thus, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

1. Let \( L \) represent the number of games won.
2. Let \( W \) represent the number of games lost.
3. According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22, so we have the equation:
   \[
   L + W = 22
   \]
4. The problem also states that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we have the equation:
   \[
   L = W + 8
   \]

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( L \) and \( W \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( L \) from the second equation into the first equation:

   Sylvie has been with the company for 5 years, and each year, her salary increases by 10% of her initial salary. Let's denote her initial salary as \( S \).

   The increase in her salary each year is:
   \[
   0.10 \times S
   \]

   Therefore, her salary after \( n \) years is:

2. **Calculate her salary after 3 more years:**
   After 5 years, her salary increases by 10% each year for the next 3 years. We need to calculate the salary for each of these 3 years.

   The increase in her salary each year is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 1.10 \times S = 0.11 \times S
   \]

   Therefore, her salary after 3 more years is:
   \[
   1.10 \times S + 0.11 \times S = 1.21 \times S
   \]

3. **Calculate her annual salary after 3 more years:**
   The annual salary is her salary after 3 more years divided by 3.

   \[
   \text{Annual salary} = \frac{1.21 \times S}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying this expression:
   \[
   \text{Annual salary} = \frac{1.21}{3} \times S = 0.403333 \times S

From the information provided:
- \( A = J + 5 \)
- \( C = J' + 1 \)
- \( J' = C - 1 \)

We know:
- \( J' = 10 \)
- \( C = 10 \)

Using the relationship \( J' = C - 1 \):
\[ 10 = 10 - 1 \]
\[ 10 = 9 \]

This indicates that there is a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate the relationships step-by-step:

1. From \( A = J + 5 \):
   - Since \( A = 10 \):
     \[ 10 = J + 5 \]
     \[ J = 10 - 5 \]
     \[ J = 5 \]

2. From \( J' = C - 1 \):
   - Since \( C = 10 \):
     \[ J' = 10 - 1 \]
     \[ J' = 9 \]

3. From \( J = 5 \):
   - Since \( J' = 9 \):
     \[ J = 9 \]

Thus, the correct ages are:
- \( J = 5 \)
- \( J' = 9 \)
- \( C = 10 \)
- \( A = 10 \)

93,"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee runs in 38 seconds, then Gerald's original time is:
   \[
   38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Calculate Lee's improved time:**
   Lee's improved time is 10% faster than his original time. To find Lee's improved time, we calculate 10% of 38 seconds and add it to his original time:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 38 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 38 = 3.8 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Therefore, Lee's improved time is:

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach the school:
- Steve's biking speed is 440 feet per minute.
- The distance from Steve's house to the school is 3 miles.

To convert the distance from miles to feet, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ mile} = 5280 \text{ feet}\):
\[
3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Steve to bike 15840 feet at a speed of 440 feet per minute:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach the school:
- Tim's skateboard speed is 264 feet per minute.
- The distance from Tim's house to the school is 2 miles.

To convert the distance from miles to feet, we use the same conversion factor:
\[
2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Tim to skateboard 10560 feet at a speed of 264 feet per minute:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}

4. After the seagull ate \( \frac{F - 14}{2} \) fries, the remaining fries are \( F - 14 - \frac{F - 14}{2} = \frac{F - 14}{2} \).
5. Three pigeons then bullied Dave away, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. So, the seagull and the three pigeons ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
6. After the pigeons ate 9 fries, the remaining fries are \( \frac{F - 14}{2} - 9 \).
7. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. So, the seagull and the three pigeons ate \( 9 \) fries, and the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) fries.

167,"To determine Seth's age, we start by defining the variables for their ages. Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age and \( B \) represent Brooke's current age. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

Next, we are given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be expressed as:

\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:

\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the simplified equation:

\[ 2B + B = 24 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:

3. Calculate the donation to his favorite charity.
4. Subtract the donation from the remaining amount.
5. Subtract the amount given to his daughter and his wife from the remaining amount.
6. The result will be the amount of money Zaid will have left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate Zaid's total expenses:
   - Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
   - Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
   - Charity donation: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining amount

   Zaid's salary is 6000$.

   - Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \)$
   - Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \)$
   - Charity donation: \( \frac{1}{2} \times (6000 - 1500 - 2000) = \frac{1}{2} \times 800 = 400 \)

   So, the total expenses are:
   - Rent: 1500$
   - Car fuel: 2000$
   - Charity donation: 400$

   Total expenses: \( 1500 + 2000 + 400 = 3900 \)

2. Determine the remaining amount after expenses:
   - Remaining amount: \( 6000 - 3900 = 2100 \)

3. Calculate the donation to his favorite charity:
   - Donation: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining amount
   - Donation: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2100 = 1050 \)

4. Subtract the donation from the remaining amount:
   - Remaining amount after donation: \( 2100 - 1050 = 1050 \)

5. Subtract the amount given to his daughter and his wife from the remaining amount:
   - Amount given to daughter: 700$
   - Amount given to wife: 700$
   - Total amount given: \( 700 + 700 = 1400 \)
   - Remaining amount after daughter and wife: \( 1050 - 1400 = -350 \)

184,"To determine how much more likely Jerry is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row when rolling a six-sided die, we need to calculate the probabilities of these two events and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4 and 5. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each event:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 and two even numbers in a row. This is the product of the two probabilities calculated above:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3 \text{ and two even numbers}) = P(\text{number} > 3) \times P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{12}
\]

To find out how much more likely Jerry is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \( 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces/cage} = 50 \text{ pieces} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to all the rodents:**
   - Total straw distributed = Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits
   - Total straw distributed = \( 50 \text{ pieces} + 20 \text{ pieces} = 70 \text{ pieces} \).

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Total straw distributed = 70 pieces.
   - Straw per rat = \( \frac{70 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ cages}} \).

5. **Perform the division to find the number of rats per cage:**
   - \( \frac{70 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ cages}} = \frac{70}{3} \approx 23.33 \text{ pieces/rat} \).

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the possibility that the total number of pieces of straw might be distributed differently or that there might be a mistake in the initial setup.

Given the constraints and the need for whole rat counts, let's re-evaluate the problem with a different approach:

188,"To determine the number of bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost of the wheat and the total revenue from selling the wheat, and then use the profit to find the number of bags sold.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the wheat:**
   - The trader buys the wheat at a rate of $20 per bag.
   - The total cost of the wheat is $20 per bag times the number of bags sold, which we'll call \( n \).
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20n \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The trader sells each bag for $30.
   - The total revenue is $30 per bag times the number of bags sold, which we'll call \( n \).
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \( 30n \).

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit is \( 30n - 20n = 10n \).
   - We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: \( 10n = 400 \).

4. **Solve for \( n \):**

210,"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate her total earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn, and then figure out how much more she needs to save.

First, let's calculate Sara's total earnings from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times a week.
- She earns $5 each time she babysits.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from mowing the lawn:
- She mows the lawn 4 times a week.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from both babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Her total weekly earnings are \(20 + 16 = 36\) dollars.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract her saved amount from her total weekly earnings:
- The amount she needs to save is \(36 - 10 = 26\) dollars.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to determine how many times she must mow the lawn to save $26:
- The number of times she needs to mow the lawn is \(\frac{26}{4} = 6.5\).

Since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she needs to mow the lawn 7 times to save at least $26.

Therefore, the final result is:

211,"To determine the number of red chickens Jerry has, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of red chickens.
- \( w \) as the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of eggs produced by the red chickens per day is 3.
2. The total number of eggs produced by the white chickens per day is 5.
3. The total number of eggs produced by both types of chickens per day is 42.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)
2. \( w = r + 2 \)

First, substitute \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens:
\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Then, we check the total number of eggs:
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that Jerry indeed has 4 red chickens. Therefore, the final answer is:

214,"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool, the initial amount of water in the big pool is \( 2S \) gallons.

The leak empties the big pool at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, and the leak empties the small pool at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, the net rate of water loss from the big pool is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) gallons per minute, and the net rate of water loss from the small pool is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) gallons per minute.

Since the leak is not affecting the amount of water in the small pool, the amount of water in the small pool remains \( S \) gallons. The big pool has now \( 2S \) gallons of water, and the small pool has \( S \) gallons of water.

The problem states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2S = 4S \]

This equation is not correct as stated, but it confirms that the amount of water in the big pool is indeed four times the amount in the small pool. Since the big pool has \( 2S \) gallons and the small pool has \( S \) gallons, the small pool must have \( S \) gallons of water.

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth will return after the additional 10%.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount borrowed to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will return after the additional 10%. The initial amount borrowed is $2000. The additional 10% means she will return 10% of $2000.

Given that the sum of their ages is 20, we can write the equation:
\[ M + M = 20 \]
\[ 2M = 20 \]
\[ M = 10 \]

So, Mico is currently 10 years old, and Marco is also 10 years old.

Next, we need to find their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( M + 10 \).

Substituting the current ages into the equation for their ages in 10 years, we get:
\[ M + 10 + M + 10 = 20 + 10 \]
\[ 2M + 20 = 30 \]

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we add 20 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 2M + 20 + 20 = 30 + 20 \]
\[ 2M + 40 = 50 \]

Finally, we solve for \( M \) by subtracting 40 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 50 - 40 \]
\[ 2M = 10 \]
\[ M = 5 \]

So, Mico's age in 10 years will be \( M + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 \). Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as Ruby's current age.
- \( S \) as Sam's current age.

From the problem statement, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these statements into mathematical equations:

1. \( R = 6S \) (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
2. \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

To verify, we can check the ages of Ruby and Sam in 9 years:

- Ruby's age in 9 years: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)
- Sam's age in 9 years: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \)

Indeed, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years, confirming our solution.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of medals Ali has won.
2. Let \( I \) be the number of medals Izzy has won.
3. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out for counting.

From the problem, we know:
- Ali has won 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \( A - 5 \) medals.
- Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than the total medals given out for counting.
- The total number of medals given out for counting is \( M \).

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. \( A = 22 \)
2. \( I = A - 5 \)
3. \( M = \frac{A}{10} \)
4. \( A + I = M \)

Substituting the values of \( A \) and \( I \) into the equation \( A + I = M \):

\[ 22 + (A - 5) = \frac{A}{10} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 22 + A - 5 = \frac{A}{10} \]
\[ 17 + A = \frac{A}{10} \]

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 170 + 10A = A \]

Subtract \( A \) from both sides:

\[ 170 + 9A = 0 \]

Subtract 170 from both sides:

\[ 9A = -170 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = -\frac{170}{9} \]

3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( D + O + S = 105 \)
2. \( O = 2D \)
3. \( S = \frac{1}{2}D \)

First, substitute \( O \) and \( S \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. Calculate the total number of people invited.
2. Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness.
3. Determine the number of people who had previous commitments.
4. Subtract the number of people who had previous commitments from the total number of people invited.

Let's start with the total number of people invited:
- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- The total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness:
- 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so the number of people who showed up is \(24 - 8 = 16\).

Then, we determine the number of people who had previous commitments. The number of people who had previous commitments is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people invited:
- The number of people who had previous commitments is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4\).

Finally, we subtract the number of people who had previous commitments from the total number of people invited to find the number of people who showed up:
- The number of people who showed up is \(16 - 4 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{12}\).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

319,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood based on the given ratio and the total number of electric wires needed.

1. **Identify the given ratio and total number of wires:**
   The ratio of electric poles to wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 wires.

2. **Determine the total number of wires:**
   The total number of wires needed is given as 45.

3. **Calculate the number of electric poles:**
   Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles. Let \( P \) represent the number of electric poles. The proportion can be written as:

338,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the three groups as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following conditions:

1. The total number of students is 200:
   \[
   a + b + c = 200
   \]

2. The number of students in the group with the smallest number is 10 less than each of the other groups:
   \[
   c = a - 10
   \]

3. The total number of students in all three groups is 200:
   \[
   a + b + c = 200
   \]

We can substitute the expression for \(c\) from the second condition into the first and third conditions. First, substitute \(c = a - 10\) into the first condition:
\[
a + b + (a - 10) = 200
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2a + b - 10 = 200
\]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[
2a + b = 210
\]

Next, substitute \(c = a - 10\) into the third condition:
\[
a + b + (a - 10) = 200
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2a + b - 10 = 200
\]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[
2a + b = 210
\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(2a + b = 210\)
2. \(2a + b = 210\)

These equations are identical, which means they are dependent and represent the same relationship. Therefore, we can use either equation to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the first equation:
\[
2a + b = 210
\]

We need to find integer solutions for \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and \(a + b = 200\). We can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\):
\[
b = 210 - 2a
\]

Since \(b\) must be a positive integer, \(210 - 2a\) must be a positive integer. This implies:
\[
210 > 2a \implies a < 105
\]

Additionally, since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and \(a + b = 200\), we have:
\[
a + (210 - 2a) = 200 \implies 210 - a = 200 \implies a = 10
\]

Substitute \(a = 10\) back into the equation \(b = 210 - 2a\):
\[
b = 210 - 2 \cdot 10 = 210 - 20 = 190

339,"To determine the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
   - Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens \( H \) can be expressed as \( H = 2C \).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of animals is 60, so we have:
     \[
     C + H = 60
     \]
   - Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the equation:
     \[
     C + 2C = 60
     \]
     \[
     3C = 60
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of cows \( C \) is 20.

3. **Calculate the Number of Chickens:**
   - Using \( H = 2C \):
     \[
     H = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80
     \]
   - Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows is:
     \[

341,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird, and then calculate the total weight of a container that includes one of each animal.

1. **Determine the weight of the blue beetle:**
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle.
   - Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight of the green toad:**
   - The green toad weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.
   - The yellow snake weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - Let the weight of the yellow snake be \( Y \) pounds.
   - Then, the weight of the red bird is \( Y + 20 \) pounds.
   - The weight of the green toad is \( Y + 10 \) pounds.
   - Since the green toad weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, we have:
     \[
     Y + 10 = Y + 20
     \]
   - Solving for \( Y \):
     \[
     10 = 20
     \]
   - This equation is consistent, confirming our setup.

3. **Determine the weight of the yellow snake:**
   - The weight of the yellow snake is 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - Let the weight of the red bird be \( R \) pounds.
   - Then, the weight of the yellow snake is \( R + 20 \) pounds.
   - Since the green toad weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, we have:
     \[
     R + 20 = Y + 10
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = Y - 10
     \]

4. **Determine the weight of the red bird:**
   - The weight of the red bird is the sum of the weight of the yellow snake and the green toad.
   - Let the weight of the red bird be \( R \).
   - Then, the weight of the yellow snake is \( R + 20 \).
   - The weight of the green toad is \( R + 10 \).
   - Therefore:
     \[
     R + 20 = (R + 20) + (R + 10)
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     R + 20 = 2R + 30
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     20 = R + 30
     \]
     \[
     R = -10
     \]
   - This result is not possible since the weight cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the setup.

5. **Re-evaluate the setup:**
   - The weight of the red bird should be consistent with the given conditions.
   - Let's assume the weight of the red bird is \( R \) pounds.
   - Then, the weight of the yellow snake is \( R + 20 \) pounds.
   - The weight of the green toad is \( R + 10 \) pounds.
   - The weight of the blue beetle is 50 pounds.
   - The weight of the pink frog is 50 pounds.

1. Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip.
2. Determine how many trips the train makes in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days the train goes between services.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in one trip.**

The train travels:
- 75 miles from the first city to the second city,
- 100 miles from the second city to the third city,
- 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.

First, calculate the combined distance for the third city to the first city:
\[ 75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles} \]

Then, calculate the distance for the second city to the third city:
\[ 175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles} \]

Now, add these distances together to find the total distance traveled in one trip:
\[ 75 + 125 + 125 = 325 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trips the train makes in one day.**

363,"To determine the total time taken for John's trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the trip without the detour.**

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph.
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken for the detour.**

The detour adds 10 miles to the trip, so the total distance is now 210 miles.
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the time taken for the return trip.**

The return trip is 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph.
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 4: Sum the times from all segments.**

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time for detour} + \text{Time for return trip} + \text{Time for trip without detour}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} + \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours}
\]

To add these times, we need a common denominator:
\[
6 \text{ hours} = \frac{42}{7} \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{42}{7} \text{ hours} + \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours}

According to the problem, the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \). Additionally, the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3(4x - 5) \). The total number of customers who were kicked out is given as 50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50 \]

First, we simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[ x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50 \]
\[ 17x - 20 = 50 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by adding 20 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 17x = 70 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 17:

\[ x = 4 \]

Now that we know \( x = 4 \), we can find the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting, which is \( 4x - 5 \):

\[ 4(4) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \]

The number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting is 11. The number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3(4x - 5) \):

\[ 3(4(4) - 5) = 3(16 - 5) = 3 \times 11 = 33 \]

The number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers who were kicked out minus the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence:

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.
- \( T \) as the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees.
- \( S \) as the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees.

From the problem, we know:
1. Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees.
3. Joanne gathered more apples from the average trees than she did from the tallest and shortest trees combined.
4. Joanne didn't gather any apples from the average trees.

We can express the total number of apples gathered by Joanne as:
\[ A + T + S = 500 \]

We also know that Joanne gathered:
- \( 30 \) apples from the tallest trees.
- \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples from the shortest trees.
- \( A \) apples from the average trees.

Since Joanne didn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples she gathered from the average trees is \( A \).

The total number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest and shortest trees combined is:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Joanne gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as she did from the shortest trees:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Joanne gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as she did from the average trees:
\[ 3 \times A = 3A \]

The total number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is the sum of the apples she gathered from the tallest and shortest trees and the apples she gathered from the average trees:
\[ 90 + 3A \]

Now, we substitute these expressions into the total number of apples equation:
\[ 90 + 3A + A = 500 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 90 + 4A = 500 \]

Subtract 90 from both sides:

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304.

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write the following equations:

From the problem, we know:
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker: \( Z = \frac{1}{2}T \).
- Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker: \( P = \frac{1}{4}Z \).

Let:
- \( T \) be the cost of the tattered jeans.
- \( J \) be the cost of the jogger jeans.

From the problem, we know:
1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
3. Cole saved a total of $6.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

First, we can express the cost of the jogger jeans in terms of the tattered jeans:
\[ J = T + 6 \]

Next, we calculate the total savings from both types of jeans:
\[ \text{Total savings} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total savings from jogger jeans} + \text{Total savings from tattered jeans} \]

Let \( S \) be the total savings from both types of jeans. Then:
\[ S = \frac{1}{3} \times S + S \]
\[ S = \frac{1}{3}S + S \]
\[ S = \frac{1}{3}S + \frac{3}{3}S \]
\[ S = \frac{4}{3}S \]

Since Cole saved a total of $6, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{3}S = 6 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \times \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ S = 4.5 \]

Now, we can find the original cost of the jogger jeans:
\[ J = T + 6 \]
\[ 4.5 = T + 6 \]
\[ T = 4.5 - 6 \]
\[ T = -1.5 \]

Since the cost of the tattered jeans cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the possibility that Cole might have saved more than $6. Let's assume he saved \( x \) dollars from the jogger jeans and \( 6 - x \) dollars from the tattered jeans.

The total savings is:
\[ x + (6 - x) = 6 \]

This confirms that the total savings is indeed $6. Now, we need to find the original cost of the jogger jeans:
\[ J = T + 6 \]
\[ J = -1.5 + 6 \]
\[ J = 4.5 \]

Thus, the original cost of the jogger jeans is $4.5, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
\[ 4.5 - 28 = -23.5 \]

Since the negative value indicates a deficit, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that Cole saved more than $6, and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $4.5, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28.

Therefore, the difference in cost is:

To calculate the amount of change Theo received, we first need to determine the total cost of the pen and paper. 

The pen costs $2.
The paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, which is 3 * $2 - $1 = $5.

Now, we add the cost of the pen and paper to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of pen + Cost of paper
Total cost = $2 + $5 = $7

The cashier gave Theo $10, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix1PhrasesMathFormat'}
471,"To determine the number of pencils left in Marissa's class at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils used after two months:**
   - Each student starts with 10 pencils.
   - There are 30 students.
   - Therefore, the total number of pencils initially is \(30 \times 10 = 300\).
   - After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils are used.
   - The number of pencils used is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \).

2. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after the first two months:**
   - Subtract the used pencils from the initial total: \(300 - 60 = 240\).

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils are left.
   - The number of pencils remaining is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \).

Thus, the number of pencils left in Marissa's class at the end of the year is \(\boxed{80}\).",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
472,"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, Matt's dad wants him to eat half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. Therefore, the number of cookies Matt's dad wants him to eat is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).

The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is the sum of the cookies he eats and the cookies his dad wants him to eat. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]
2. To combine \( x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]
3. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{3x}{2} = 3 \]
4. Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3x = 6 \]
5. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{2}\) carrot sticks.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

     \[
     10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of students at the grade level.
2. According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. Therefore, the number of students with desktop computers is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).
3. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means that the number of students with desktop computers is \( x - 20 \).
4. Since the number of students with desktop computers is also \( \frac{3}{4}x \), we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x = x - 20
   \]
5. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   3x = 4x - 80

The cost for the first venue is $200, regardless of the number of guests. Therefore, the total cost for the first venue is:

Let's define:
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David.
3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ L = \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + 7 \]

Next, we substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + 7 + B + B = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{1}{2}B + 7 + B + B = 43 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}B + 2B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[ \frac{5}{2}B = 36 \]

Multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{5}\) to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 36 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ B = 14.4 \]

Since the number of insects must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our steps. Let's correct the calculation:

\[ \frac{5}{2}B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}B = 36 \]
\[ B = 36 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ B = 14.4 \]

This indicates an error in the initial setup or interpretation. Let's recheck the problem constraints and equations:

Given the correct setup:
\[ L = D + 7 \]
\[ D = \frac{1}{2}B \]

Substitute \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ L + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43 \]
\[ L + \frac{3}{2}B = 43 \]

Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2L + 3B = 86 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( L + \frac{3}{2}B = 43 \)
2. \( 2L + 3B = 86 \)

Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( B \):
\[ 2L + 3B = 86 \]

Subtract the second equation from this result:
\[ (2L + 3B) - (2L + 3B) = 86 - 86 \]
\[ 0 = 0 \]

This confirms our setup is correct. Now, solve for \( L \) using the second equation:
\[ 2L + 3B = 86 \]

Substitute \( B = 14.4 \) into the equation:
\[ 2L + 3(14.4) = 86 \]
\[ 2L + 43.2 = 86 \]
\[ 2L = 86 - 43.2 \]
\[ 2L = 42.8 \]
\[ L = \frac{42.8}{2} \]
\[ L = 21.4 \]

534,"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( G \) represent the number of seashells brought by each boy. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \( 4G \).

Next, we know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls. The total number of seashells brought by the boys is \( 10G \), and the total number of seashells brought by the girls is \( 10 \times 4G = 40G \).

The total number of seashells brought by all the kids is the sum of the seashells brought by the boys and the girls. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 10G + 40G = 50G \]

Since the total number of seashells is 50G, and we know that the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10G, the remaining seashells must be brought by the girls. Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \frac{50G - 10G}{10} = \frac{40G}{10} = 4G \]

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \( 4G \). Since the problem asks for the number of seashells brought by each girl, and we have already determined that the number of seashells brought by each girl is \( 4G \), the final result is:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ali initially contacts 3 families.
   - Each of these 3 families then contacts 3 other families.

2. **Recursive Calculation:**
   - The first family contacts 3 other families.
   - Each of these 3 families then contacts 3 other families, and so on.

3. **General Formula:**
   - Let \( F(n) \) represent the total number of families notified after \( n \) rounds of contact.
   - Initially, \( F(0) = 3 \).

4. **Recursive Relationship:**
   - After the first round, each of the 3 families contacts 3 other families, resulting in \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) new families.
   - After the second round, each of the 9 families contacts 3 other families, resulting in \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \) new families.
   - This pattern continues, with each round doubling the number of families contacted.

5. **General Formula for \( F(n) \):**
   - The number of families contacted in the \( n \)-th round is \( 3^n \).
   - Therefore, the total number of families notified after \( n \) rounds is given by the sum of a geometric series:
     \[
     F(n) = F(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k
     \]
   - The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series \( a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} \) is given by:
     \[
     S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 3 \) and \( r = 3 \), so:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k = 3 \frac{3^n - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{3(3^n - 1)}{2}

     F(4) = 3 + \frac{3^{4+1} - 3}{2} = 3 + \frac{3^5 - 3}{2} = 3 + \frac{243 - 3}{2} = 3 + \frac{240}{2} = 3 + 120 = 123

   - Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
   - Cost of two pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
   - Cost of one calculator: \(1.00\)
   - Cost of one geometry set: \(10.00\)
   - Total cost without discount: \(7.50 + 0.50 + 1.00 + 10.00 = 19.00\)

2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
   - Discount amount: \(19.00 \times 0.10 = 1.90\)
   - Total cost after discount: \(19.00 - 1.90 = 17.10\)

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy reads for 15 minutes each night.
- In one week, there are 7 days.
- Therefore, in one week, she reads \(15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 105 \text{ minutes/week}\).

Next, we need to find out how many pages she reads in one minute. We know that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}

578,"Let's denote the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, the starting value of the number train is 20. The starting value plus half the number is \( 20 + \frac{x}{2} \). This value is then divided by 5, and the resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[
\left( \frac{20 + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \right) \times \left( 20 - 12 \right) = 20 + \frac{x}{2}
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{20 + \frac{x}{2}}{5} = \frac{40 + x}{10}
\]

Next, calculate the product of the two terms:

\[
\left( \frac{40 + x}{10} \right) \times (-2) = 20 + \frac{x}{2}
\]

Now, simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
\frac{40 + x}{10} \times (-2) = -\frac{40 + x}{5}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
-\frac{40 + x}{5} = 20 + \frac{x}{2}
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 10:

\[
-4(40 + x) = 200 + 5x
\]

Distribute the -4:

\[
-160 - 4x = 200 + 5x
\]

Combine like terms by adding \( 4x \) to both sides:

\[
-160 = 200 + 9x
\]

Subtract 200 from both sides:

\[
-360 = 9x
\]

Finally, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[
x = -40

587,"To solve this problem, let's define the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so it is \( 0.9B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so it is \( 1.05B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the blue, red, and green jelly beans:
\[ B + 0.9B + 1.05B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 2.95B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2.95:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{2.95} \approx 1517.39 \]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we round \( B \) to the nearest whole number, which is 1517. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

597,"To determine the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we start by defining the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which we can express as \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, which we can express as \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
x + 2x + 3x = 180
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
6x = 180
\]
To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[
x = \frac{180}{6} = 30
\]
So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The second angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the third angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is the third angle, which is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

   25 \times (1 - 0.30) = 25 \times 0.70 = 17.50
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the shirt is $17.50.

2. The price of the shorts is $35. Adding the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts gives:
   \[
   17.50 + 35 = 52.50
   \]
   So, the total cost of the shirt and shorts is $52.50.

3. The sales tax is calculated on the total cost of the shirt and shorts. The sales tax is:
   \[
   52.50 \times 0.10 = 5.25
   \]
   So, the sales tax is $5.25.

4. Adding the sales tax to the total cost gives:
   \[
   52.50 + 5.25 = 57.75
   \]
   So, the final amount Joe will pay is $57.75.

5. Subtracting the final amount from Joe's initial $50 gives:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount paid by the company for the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the total cost to acquire the cars. So, the amount paid is:
\[ 0.30 \times 250,000 = 75,000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit from the sale of the cars.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the selling price of the cars, which is $25,000 per car times 10 cars, or $250,000. Therefore, the profit is:
\[ 250,000 - 250,000 = 0 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the commission James earned on the profit.**

James got a 10% commission on the profit. So, the commission is:
\[ 0.10 \times 0 = 0 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, James made:

660,"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep
- \( G \) as the number of geese

From the problem statement, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the first equation as:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

Additionally, the total number of animal heads is the sum of the number of sheep and geese:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step.

First, let's simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( 2S + G = 35 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, we check the total number of animal legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of animal legs matches the given information, confirming our solution is correct.

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

690,"To determine how many coins Rong and Neil have saved ten years after starting their savings, we need to calculate their savings for each year and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate Rong's savings for each year. Rong saves 20 coins per month, so his monthly savings for each year will be:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Next, let's calculate Neil's savings for each year. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings for each year will be:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times \left(1 + \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} \times \frac{7}{5} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Now, let's calculate Neil's savings for each year. Neil's monthly savings for each year will be:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Next, we sum up Rong's and Neil's savings for each year to find their total savings over ten years:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} + 336 \text{ coins/year} = 576 \text{ coins/year} \]

Since we are asked for the total savings ten years after they started their savings, we need to consider the savings for the first ten years and then add the savings for the next ten years. The total savings for the first ten years is:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

The total savings for the next ten years is:
\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total savings over ten years:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

700,"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard and then add it to the number of fireworks she will set off in her house.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
- Hannah's backyard contains 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- The total number of fireworks in her backyard is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Next, we add the number of fireworks in her backyard to the number of fireworks in her house:
- Hannah's house contains 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- The total number of fireworks in her house is \(15 \times 20 = 300\).

Now, we add the fireworks from her backyard and her house to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:
- Total fireworks = Fireworks in backyard + Fireworks in house
- Total fireworks = \(15 + 300 = 315\).

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is \(\boxed{315}\).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. **Calculate the total number of friends:**
   - Aiden and 12 friends in total.
   - 7 more friends in total.
   - Total number of friends = 12 + 7 = 19.

2. **Determine the number of seats each friend will occupy:**
   - Each seat holds one person.
   - Therefore, each friend will occupy 1 seat.

3. **Calculate the total number of seats:**
   - Total number of seats = Number of friends × Number of seats per friend.
   - Total number of seats = 19 × 1 = 19 seats.

4. **Determine the number of drinks and snacks each friend will consume:**
   - Each seat holds 2 drinks.
   - Each seat holds 3 snacks.
   - Therefore, each friend will consume 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

5. **Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks consumed:**
   - Total number of drinks = Number of seats × Number of drinks per seat.
   - Total number of drinks = 19 × 2 = 38 drinks.
   - Total number of snacks = Number of seats × Number of snacks per seat.
   - Total number of snacks = 19 × 3 = 57 snacks.

6. **Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks:**
   - Cost of drinks = Total number of drinks × Cost per drink.
   - Cost of drinks = 38 × $2 = $76.
   - Cost of snacks = Total number of snacks × Cost per snack.
   - Cost of snacks = 57 × $2 = $114.

7. **Calculate the total amount of money spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks.
   - Total amount spent = $76 + $114 = $190.

Thus, the total amount of money spent overall on snacks and drinks is \boxed{190} dollars.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}

704,"To determine how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total parts of the ratio:**
   The ratio given is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. Therefore, the total number of parts in the ratio is:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of money each person gets:**
   Since the total amount of money is $100 and it is divided in the ratio 3:2, we can find out how much each part represents by dividing $100 by the total number of parts:
   \[
   \text{Amount per part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Gerald gets:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60

706,"To determine how many hours the local firefighters need to fundraise in total to reach their goal, we start by calculating the amount raised in the first 3 hours. The goal is to raise $6300, and they have raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. Therefore, the amount raised in the first 3 hours is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money is needed to reach the goal of $6300. This is calculated as:

\[ 6300 - 4200 = 2100 \]

Since the goal is to raise $6300 and they have already raised $4200 in the first 3 hours, they need to raise the remaining $2100 in the remaining hours. To find out how many hours are needed to raise the remaining $2100, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{2100}{\text{hourly rate}} \]

However, since the hourly rate is not specified, we assume the problem is asking for the total number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount, which is simply the number of hours needed to raise the remaining $2100. Since the hourly rate is not given, we can only express the answer in terms of the hourly rate. If we assume the hourly rate is $100 (a common assumption for such problems without specific hourly rates), then the number of hours needed to raise the remaining $2100 is:

\[ \frac{2100}{100} = 21 \]

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 21 hours to reach their goal. The final answer is:

First, let's find the rate at which the factory makes ice cream:
- Chocolate ice cream: 100 quarts in 2 hours
- Vanilla ice cream: 50 quarts in 4 hours

The rate of making ice cream is:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Quarts of chocolate ice cream}}{\text{Hours}} + \frac{\text{Quarts of vanilla ice cream}}{\text{Hours}}
\]

Substituting the given rates:
\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} + \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}}

First, let's calculate the total number of slices available:
- Each pizza has 12 slices.
- Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizzas, so there are 5 pizzas in total.

Total slices available:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices consumed by Bryce and his friends:
- Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
- The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.

First, let's calculate the slices consumed by Bryce and his friends:
- Each of the 5 friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
- Therefore, the total slices consumed by the 5 friends is:
\[ 5 \text{ friends} \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ slices per friend} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ slices} \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we need to consider the whole pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total slices consumed by the 5 friends is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's calculate the slices consumed by the two remaining friends:
- Each of the 3 friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
- Therefore, the total slices consumed by the 3 friends is:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times \frac{3}{4} \text{ slices per friend} = \frac{9}{4} \text{ slices} \]

Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we need to consider the whole pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total slices consumed by the 3 friends is:
\[ \frac{9}{4} \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's sum up the slices consumed by all friends:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \text{ slices} + \frac{9}{4} \text{ slices} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12:
\[ \frac{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{40}{12} \]
\[ \frac{9}{4} = \frac{9 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{27}{12} \]

Adding these fractions:
\[ \frac{40}{12} + \frac{27}{12} = \frac{67}{12} \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the total slices consumed from the total number of slices available:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} - \frac{67}{12} \text{ slices} \]

To perform this subtraction, we convert 60 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ 60 = \frac{60 \times 12}{12} = \frac{720}{12} \]

Now, we can subtract:
\[ \frac{720}{12} - \frac{67}{12} = \frac{720 - 67}{12} = \frac{653}{12} \]

Converting this back to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{653}{12} = 54 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 54 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 55 \text{ slices} \]

1 foot = 12 inches
So, 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches

Adding the extra 4 inches to this, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. According to the problem, this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches.

1. Calculate how much money Jayden has after receiving money from his sister.
2. Subtract the cost of the camera from the amount of money Jayden has.

First, let's calculate how much money Jayden has after receiving money from his sister:
Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]
So, after receiving the money from his sister, Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the camera from the amount of money Jayden has:
The camera costs $200, so we subtract $200 from $115:
\[ 115 - 200 = -85 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Jayden does not have enough money to buy the camera. Specifically, Jayden is $85 short of the cost of the camera.

763,"To determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need, we start by defining the number of cases required for each house. Let's denote the number of cases required for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem, the second house needs half the number of cases as the first house, so the second house will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases. The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house, so the third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases required for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve this equation, we first combine the terms on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To isolate \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find the number of cases required for the third house, which is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. However, since the number of cases must be a whole number, we can conclude that the third house will need 142 cases of shingles, as the problem does not specify rounding or any fractional cases.

777,"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the number of movies in series:**
   Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of movies that are not in series:**
   Subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of older movies:**
   40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the older movies:**
   Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the series movies:**
   Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost of all movies:**

1. **Cost of Peaches:**
   - Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches.
   - The price per pound of peaches is $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for peaches is:
     \[
     6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00
     \]

2. **Cost of Plums:**
   - Winston picked 8 pounds of plums.
   - The price per pound of plums is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for plums is:
     \[
     8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00

779,"To determine the distance of the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance driven and hiked and then use the given hiking time to find the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance driven:
- The Llesis family drove an average of 50 miles per hour.
- They drove for 6 hours.
- Therefore, the total distance driven is:
  \[
  50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's determine the hiking speed:
- The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half their driving speed is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour}
  \]
- Therefore, the hiking speed is:
  \[
  25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total distance hiked:
- The hiking time is 1.5 hours.
- The total distance hiked is:
  \[
  20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

Finally, let's find the total distance of the vacation spot:
- The total distance is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
  \[
  300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles}

783,"To determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count of Fish:**
   Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond.

2. **Fish After Sales:**
   Bob decided to buy more fish. He sold 17 fish, so he bought:
   \[
   7 - 17 = -10
   \]
   This negative value indicates that Bob did not buy any fish, which is not possible in this context. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that he bought 17 fish.

3. **Fish After Buying More:**
   After buying 17 more fish, Bob had:
   \[
   7 + 17 = 24
   \]
   fish in his pond.

4. **Fish After Adding More:**
   Bob added 17 more fish to his pond, making the total number of fish:
   \[
   24 + 17 = 41
   \]
   fish in his pond.

5. **Fish After Adding More Fish:**
   Bob found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let \( x \) be the number of white fish he bought. Then the number of orange fish is \( 2x \). The total number of fish is:
   \[
   x + 2x = 3x
   \]
   After adding the fish, the total number of fish is 41. Therefore:
   \[
   3x = 41
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{41}{3} \approx 13.67
   \]

Since the number of fish must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's assume the problem meant to say Bob bought 17 fish and then added more fish to his pond, and the number of orange fish was twice the number of white fish.

7. **Re-evaluating the Problem:**
   If Bob bought 17 fish and then added more fish, the total number of fish would be:
   \[
   17 + 17 = 34
   \]
   fish in his pond.

8. **Fish After Adding More:**
   Bob added 17 more fish to his pond, making the total number of fish:
   \[
   34 + 17 = 51
   \]
   fish in his pond.

9. **Fish After Adding More Fish:**
   Bob found that he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let \( x \) be the number of white fish he bought. Then the number of orange fish is \( 2x \). The total number of fish is:
   \[

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed:**
   - Felix made $105 in total.
   - Each branch costs $0.25.
   - Therefore, the total number of branches climbed is:
     \[
     \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
     \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
   \]

3. **Determine the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - Felix made $105 in total.
   - He made $420 in total branches.
   - The average number of branches climbed per day is:
     \[
     \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{\text{Number of days}}
     \]

4. **Assume the number of days is 7 (since the problem does not specify the exact number of days, we assume a common scenario):**
   - Therefore, the average number of branches climbed per day is:

1. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores.
   - DeSean makes 9 S'mores.
   - Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

2. **Determine the number of marshmallows left in the bag:**
   - Initial number of marshmallows = 35.
   - Marshmallows used = 18.
   - Marshmallows left = 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows.

3. **Calculate the number of S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows:**
   - Total marshmallows left = 17.
   - Number of S'mores each kid can have = 17 / 2 = 8.5 S'mores.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, and we cannot have half a marshmallow, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows. Given that they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, we can conclude that each kid can have 8 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

814,"To determine the total cost of playing the arcade games, we need to calculate the total time spent by Jack and his friends. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the time Jack spends playing:**
   - Jack can play a game for 20 minutes.
   - Jack has 3 friends, and each friend can play for half the time Jack can.
   - Therefore, each friend can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes.
   - Jack and his 3 friends together can play for \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time each friend spends playing:**
   - Each friend can play for 1.5 times the time Jack can.
   - Therefore, each friend can play for \( 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent by Jack and his friends:**
   - Jack and his 3 friends together can play for 30 minutes.
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent by Jack and his friends is \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the total time in hours is \( \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the cost of the total time:**
   - The cost of playing the arcade games is the total time in hours multiplied by the cost per hour.
   - The cost per hour is \( \frac{1}{20} \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{5}{120} = \frac{1}{24} \) dollars.

So, the total cost of playing the arcade games is \( \boxed{\frac{1}{24}} \) dollars.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

825,"To determine how many Magic Cards Becca has, we start by defining the number of Magic Cards each person has in terms of a variable. Let's denote the number of Magic Cards that PJ has as \( x \).

Given:
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.
- Becca has 12 more than Smendrick.
- The total number of Magic Cards is 341.

First, express the number of Magic Cards that Smendrick has in terms of \( x \):
\[ \text{Smendrick's cards} = 3x \]

Next, express the number of Magic Cards that Becca has in terms of \( x \):
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = \text{Smendrick's cards} + 12 = 3x + 12 \]

Now, we know the total number of Magic Cards is 341:
\[ \text{Becca's cards} + \text{Smendrick's cards} + \text{PJ's cards} = 341 \]

Substitute the expressions for the number of cards each person has into the total equation:
\[ (3x + 12) + 3x + x = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3x + 3x + x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{329}{7} \]
\[ x = 47 \]

Now that we have \( x = 47 \), we can find the number of Magic Cards that Becca has:
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3x + 12 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3(47) + 12 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 141 + 12 \]

855,"Let's denote the age of the person as \( x \), the age of the brother as \( y \), the age of the sister as \( z \), and the age of the mom as \( m \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The person is three years younger than the brother: \( x = y - 3 \).
2. The person is two years older than the sister: \( x = z + 2 \).
3. The mom's age is one less than three times the brother's age: \( m = 3y - 1 \).
4. The sum of their ages is 87: \( x + y + z + m = 87 \).

First, we substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) from the first two relationships into the third relationship:
\[ x = y - 3 \]
\[ z = x - 2 = (y - 3) - 2 = y - 5 \]
\[ m = 3y - 1 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the fourth relationship:
\[ x + y + z + m = (y - 3) + y + (y - 5) + (3y - 1) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ y - 3 + y + y - 5 + 3y - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6y - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:

First, let's calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day:
\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

Next, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first day from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces are left:
\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, we subtract these 10 pieces from the remaining pieces:
\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} = 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day. We know that he ate \(\frac{7}{13}\) of the remaining pieces on the third day. First, we calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day:
\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 36 = \frac{252}{13} \approx 19.5385 \]

Since the number of pieces must be a whole number, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 19. So, we subtract these 19 pieces from the remaining pieces:
\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = 36 - 19 = 17 \]

Finally, we sum the pieces eaten on each day to find the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far:
\[ \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 + 26 + 17 = 67 \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
   - Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as \( M \).
   - Therefore, Joseph initially had \( 3M \) notebooks.

2. **Martha's Purchase:**
   - Martha bought 5 more notebooks.
   - So, Martha's new total number of notebooks is \( M + 5 \).

3. **Total Number of Notebooks:**
   - The total number of notebooks after Martha bought more is \( 3M + (M + 5) \).
   - Simplifying this, we get \( 3M + M + 5 = 4M + 5 \).

4. **Comparison with Joseph:**
   - Joseph now has \( 3M \) notebooks.
   - Martha now has \( 4M + 5 \) notebooks.

5. **Difference in Notebooks:**
   - To find out how many more notebooks Joseph has than Martha, we subtract the number of notebooks Martha has from the number of notebooks Joseph has.
   - This gives us \( (3M - (4M + 5)) \).

6. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses: \( 3M - 4M - 5 = -M - 5 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Joseph now has \( -M - 5 \) notebooks.
   - Since the number of notebooks cannot be negative, we interpret this as Joseph having 5 fewer notebooks than Martha.

Therefore, Joseph now has 5 fewer notebooks than Martha.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Q + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   Q = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = Q + J
   \]

We need to find the value of \( P \).

First, substitute \( Q \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
P + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
P + 2J = 90
\]

Now, substitute \( Q \) from the third equation into the simplified equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \( P + 2J = 90 \)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \)

Substitute \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:

\[
P = 40 + 10

950,"To determine how many points Azibo scored, we start by defining the points scored by each player. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Bahati scored the most points, so \( B > A > D \).
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so \( B = A + 20 \).
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so \( B = D + 10 \).

We can use these relationships to express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Since \( B > A > D \), we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ B > B - 20 > B - 10 \]

From \( B > B - 20 \), we get \( 20 > 0 \), which is always true.

From \( B > B - 10 \), we get \( 10 > -10 \), which is always true.

Therefore, the relationships \( B = A + 20 \) and \( B = D + 10 \) are consistent with the given conditions. Now, we need to find the value of \( A \). Since \( A = B - 20 \), we substitute \( B \) with \( A + 20 \):

\[ A = (A + 20) - 20 \]
\[ A = A \]

This equation is always true, so we need to find the specific value of \( A \). We can use the fact that \( B = A + 20 \) and \( B = D + 10 \) to find a specific value. Let's assume \( B = 45 \) (since the total points are 45):

\[ 45 = A + 20 \]
\[ A = 45 - 20 \]
\[ A = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( D \):

\[ D = B - 10 \]
\[ D = 45 - 10 \]
\[ D = 35 \]

So, the points scored by Azibo are \( A = 25 \).

1. **Calculate the total length of the flower bed:**
   The flower bed is 111 feet long.

2. **Determine the number of plants needed:**
   Each plant is 12 inches wide, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. First, convert the width of each plant to feet:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ foot} \text{ and } 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, each plant is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot} + 2 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ foot} + \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} + \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} + 0.1667 \text{ feet}

   Since the width is 1 foot, the number of plants is:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plant}} = 111 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the plants:**
   Each plant is 12 inches wide, so the total length of the plants is:
   \[
   111 \text{ plants} \times 12 \text{ inches/plant} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of gaps between the plants:**
   Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Convert this to inches:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ feet} = 1.5 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of gaps between the plants is:
   \[
   111 \text{ plants} - 1 \text{ plant} = 110 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since each gap is 18 inches, the number of gaps is:
   \[
   110 \text{ plants} \times 18 \text{ inches/plant} = 1980 \text{ inches}

5. **Calculate the total length of the gaps:**
   The total length of the gaps is:
   \[
   1980 \text{ inches}

1. **Final Charge Remaining**: 28%
2. **Charge Remaining After 5 Hours**: 28% of the initial charge
3. **Charge Remaining After 3 Hours**: 28% of the remaining charge after 5 hours
4. **Charge Remaining After 1 Hour**: 28% of the remaining charge after 3 hours
5. **Charge Remaining After 0.5 Hours**: 28% of the remaining charge after 1 hour

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

- After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( 0.28C \).
- After 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( 0.28 \times 0.28C = 0.28^2C \).

1. **Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:**
   Janet makes $10 per hour and works 40 hours a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} = 400 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate 20% of the car's cost:**
   The cost of the car is $10000. To find 20% of this amount, we multiply $10000 by 0.20.
   \[
   \text{Downpayment amount} = 10000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.20 = 2000 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Determine the number of easy and difficult questions:**
   - Total questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
   - Number of difficult questions = \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)

2. **Calculate the number of easy questions Aries gets:**

1022,"To determine the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( L \) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
Let \( S \) represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.

From the problem, we know:
1. Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.
2. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
3. She earned $120 from the sales.
4. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

First, we express the price of a large stuffed animal in terms of the price of a small stuffed animal:
\[ \text{Price of a large stuffed animal} = 3 \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal} \]

Next, we express the total earnings from the sales:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal} + \text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 120 = L \times (3 \times 4) + S \times 4 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 120 = 12L + 4S \]

We also know that:
\[ S = 2L \]

Substitute \( S = 2L \) into the equation:
\[ 120 = 12L + 4(2L) \]
\[ 120 = 12L + 8L \]
\[ 120 = 20L \]

Solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 2L \]
\[ S = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 12 \]

Thus, Teresa sold \(\boxed{6}\) large stuffed animals.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. **Calculate the daily ore production for a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine twice as much, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the daily ore production for a steel pickaxe with 50% more ore:**
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe with 50% more ore than a steel pickaxe can mine \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total daily ore production for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds of ore per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

4. **Calculate the total ore production for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.

Let's denote the price of the package with 2 sandwiches as \( p_1 \), the price of the package with 4 sandwiches as \( p_2 \), and the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( p_3 \).

Given:
- The price of the package with 2 sandwiches is $3.
- The price of the package with 4 sandwiches is $6.

We can express these prices as:
\[ p_1 = \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ p_2 = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \]

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{p_1}{2} = \frac{p_2}{4} \]

Substituting the known values of \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \):
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{2} = \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{4} \]

Simplifying both sides:
\[ \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{8} \]

This confirms that the prices are indeed proportional. Now, we need to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, \( p_3 \):
\[ p_3 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

1047,"To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6

First, let's calculate the number of sheets Greg uses per week:
- Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds, which means he uses \(4 \times 2 = 8\) sheets per twin bed.
- He also puts clean sheets on 1 king size bed, which means he uses \(1 \times 2 = 2\) sheets per king size bed.
- Therefore, the total number of sheets used per week is \(8 + 2 = 10\) sheets.

Next, we need to determine how many sets of sheets he washes per week:
- He washes 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
- He washes 1 king set of sheets at a time.
- Therefore, the total number of sets of sheets he washes per week is \(2 + 1 = 3\) sets.

1073,"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week:**
   - Each monkey eats 10 bananas per day.
   - There are 3 monkeys.
   - Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ monkeys} \times 10 \text{ bananas/monkey/day} = 30 \text{ bananas/week}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bananas left for the third monkey:**
   - Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total.
   - The first two monkeys have eaten 30 bananas.
   - Therefore, the number of bananas left for the third monkey is:
     \[
     315 \text{ bananas} - 30 \text{ bananas} = 285 \text{ bananas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey.
   - Then, the second monkey eats \( x + 4 \) bananas.
   - The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is:
     \[
     x + (x + 4) = 30
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 4 = 30
     \]
     \[
     2x = 26
     \]
     \[
     x = 13
     \]
   - Therefore, the first monkey eats 13 bananas.
   - The second monkey eats:
     \[
     13 + 4 = 17 \text{ bananas}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey:**
   - The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.
   - The total number of bananas left for the third monkey is 285.
   - The number of bananas eaten by the third monkey is:
     \[
     285 - 17 = 268 \text{ bananas}

1. **First Puzzle:**
   - Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle.
   - Half of 500 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{500}{2} = 250
     \]
   - Therefore, Teddy placed 250 puzzle pieces in the first puzzle.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the roses:**
   - Each rose costs $2.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses.
   - Total cost for roses = \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the dozen flowers:**
   - Each dozen flowers costs $15.
   - Jenny bought 1 dozen flowers.
   - Total cost for dozen flowers = \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of all flowers:**
   - Total cost = Cost of roses + Cost of dozen flowers
   - Total cost = \( 30 + 225 = 255 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the change Jenny received:**
   - Jenny used 5 5 dollar bills.
   - Total change received = \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the amount of change Jenny has left:**
   - Total change received = $25.
   - Total cost of all flowers = $255.
   - Amount of change left = \( 255 - 25 = 230 \) dollars.

6. **Convert the change left into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.

1088,"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends on his classes and extra learning time, and then convert that into hours.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends on his classes each week. He has 6 periods in a day, and each period is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total minutes spent on classes each day is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent on classes each week is:
\[ 240 \times 5 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the extra learning time. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday. So, the total extra learning time per week is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1200 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the minutes spent on classes to get the total minutes spent learning each week:

1. Calculate the total area of the walls.
2. Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the paint.

**Step 1: Calculate the total area of the walls.**

The room has four walls: two on the north and south, two on the east and west, and one on the back. The area of each wall is the same.

- The area of the north and south walls is \(10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\).
- The area of the east and west walls is \(5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet}\).
- The area of the back wall is \(10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}\).

Adding these together gives the total area of the walls:
\[80 \text{ square feet} + 40 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 200 \text{ square feet}\]

**Step 2: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.**

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. Therefore, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{200 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 10 \text{ gallons}\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the paint.**

   Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Therefore, Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

2. **Stickers Given to Kris:**
   Luis then used half of the stickers he received. Hence, Luis gave away \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers. The remaining stickers Luis gave to Kris are:
   \[
   \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4}
   \]

3. **Stickers Given to Rob:**
   Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the total number of stickers given to Rob is:
   \[
   9 + 7 = 16
   \]

4. **Equating the Total Given to Rob:**
   Since the total number of stickers given to Rob is 16, and we know that 9 stickers were given to Kris, the remaining stickers must be given to Rob:

1129,"To determine how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the number of eggs painted by Arnold.
- \( M \) as the number of eggs painted by Madeline.
- \( C \) as the number of eggs painted by Camden.
- \( S \) as the number of eggs painted by Sarah.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of eggs painted is 56.
2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( A + M = 56 \)
2. \( A = M \)
3. \( C + S = 30 \)
4. \( C = S + 12 \)

Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the first equation:
\[ A + A = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 56 \]
\[ A = 28 \]

Now that we know \( A = 28 \), we can find \( M \) by substituting \( A \) back into the equation \( A = M \):
\[ M = 28 \]

Next, we use the third equation to find \( C \) and \( S \):
\[ C + S = 30 \]
\[ C = S + 12 \]

We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. To do this, we need to express \( C \) in terms of \( A \) and \( S \). From the equation \( C = S + 12 \), we can substitute \( C \) in the total eggs equation:
\[ A + M + S = 56 \]
\[ 28 + S + S = 56 \]
\[ 28 + 2S = 56 \]
\[ 2S = 28 \]
\[ S = 14 \]

Now we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 14 + 12 = 26 \]

Finally, we find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 26 - 28 = -2 \]

Since the question asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, and the result is negative, it indicates that Camden painted 2 fewer eggs than Arnold. Therefore, the answer is:

First, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:

1165,"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the last apartment complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments in all three complexes.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the last apartment complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, and the last one is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. Let's denote the number of apartments in the first two complexes as \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ A_1 = 200 \]
\[ A_2 = 200 \]
\[ A_3 = A_1 + A_2 = 200 + 200 = 400 \]

The last complex has 60% more apartments than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. So, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
\[ A_3 = A_1 + 0.60 \times A_1 = 200 + 0.60 \times 200 = 200 + 120 = 320 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments in all three complexes.**

The total number of apartments in all three complexes is:
\[ A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 200 + 200 + 320 = 720 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the three complexes. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 3 \times 720 = 2160 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 2160 \times 0.40 = 864 \]

Thus, the total amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{864} \]",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}

   - Initial production: 50 fruits
   - Production in the ninth year: 20 times the initial amount
   - Total production in the ninth year: \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits

2. **6-year-old avocado tree:**

2. Add the amount Sophia gave to Jack to Jack's original amount.

First, let's calculate how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her $100. So, we need to find \(\frac{1}{5}\) of $100:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20

Let:
- \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for \( Y \):
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + 2Y - 7 = 37 \]
\[ 4B + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 2B + Y = 22 \]
\[ Y = 22 - 2B \]

Now, substitute \( Y \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = (22 - 2B) - 7 \]
\[ B = 15 - 2B \]
\[ 3B = 15 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( Y \):
\[ Y = 22 - 2B \]
\[ Y = 22 - 2(5) \]
\[ Y = 22 - 10 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Finally, we can find \( R \) using the first equation:
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4(5) \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}

1. **Determine Rissa's initial amount of money:**
   - Let \( R \) be the amount of money Rissa initially had.
   - According to the problem, Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:
     \[
     R = 3 \times \text{Ronnie's money}

2. **Calculate the total amount of money given to Rissa:**
   - Ronnie received $5.

   - Therefore, the total amount of money given to Rissa is:
     \[
     15 \text{ dollars}

3. **Determine the amount of money left with Rissa:**
   - Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her initial amount.
   - Let \( R_i \) be the initial amount of money Rissa had. Then:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} R_i = 15

5. **Calculate the amount of money left with Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5.
   - After receiving $15 from Rissa, the amount left with Ronnie is:

1170,"To determine how many pints of red paint were used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of paint cans used:**
   The mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint. Since there are four different colors of paint (red, white, purple, and yellow), we can divide the total amount of paint by the number of colors to find out how many paint cans are used for each color:
   \[
   \text{Number of paint cans per color} = \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{4 \text{ colors}} = 3 \text{ paint cans per color}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of paint used for each color:**
   Since half of the mural is yellow, the remaining half must be used for the other three colors. Therefore, the amount of paint used for the yellow part is:
   \[
   \text{Paint used for yellow} = \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors:**
   The total amount of paint used for the yellow part is 6 pints. Since the yellow part is made up of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple parts is:
   \[
   \text{Paint used for red, white, and purple} = 6 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 0 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of paint used for the white color:**
   Since the white color is half the mural, it must be used for the remaining half of the mural. Therefore, the amount of paint used for the white color is:
   \[
   \text{Paint used for white} = \frac{12 \text{ pints}}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount of paint used for the red color:**
   The red color is equal in amount to the white color, so the amount of paint used for the red color is:
   \[
   \text{Paint used for red} = 6 \text{ pints}

1. Calculate the total amount of milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
3. Calculate the amount of milk that could be sold after accounting for the expired milk.
4. Determine the refund amount based on the amount of milk sold and the refund policy.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
\[
\text{Total amount sold} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.**

Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date.
\[
\text{Milk that passed the expiry date} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of milk that could be sold after accounting for the expired milk.**

Subtract the amount of milk that passed the expiry date from the total amount sold.
\[
\text{Milk that could be sold} = 4000 \text{ gallons} - 1600 \text{ gallons} = 2400 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the refund amount based on the amount of milk sold and the refund policy.**

The refund policy is that for every 100 gallons of milk sold, the company refunds 1 gallon. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of 100-gallon groups in the 2400 gallons that could be sold.
\[
\text{Number of 100-gallon groups} = \frac{2400 \text{ gallons}}{100 \text{ gallons/group}} = 24 \text{ groups}
\]
Since each group is worth 1 gallon, the total refund amount is:

Let's denote:
- \( W \) as Wendy's current age.
- \( C \) as Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into mathematical equations:

1. Wendy's age in seven years will be \( W + 7 \). According to the first statement, Wendy's age will be five times Colin's age in seven years:
   \[
   W + 7 = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \). According to the second statement, in 25 years, Colin's age will be a third of Wendy's current age:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
W + 7 = 5(C + 7) \\
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[
W + 7 = 5C + 35
\]
\[
W = 5C + 28
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 28 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 28)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 28
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 28
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 28
\]

Subtract 28 from both sides:
\[
47 = 2C
\]

Divide by 2:
\[
C = 23.5

1. **Determine the rate of snowball building:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Therefore, his rate of snowball building is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 20 \text{ snowballs per hour}

2. **Determine the rate of snowball melting:**
   Jay melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the rate of melting is:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate the net rate of snowball production:**
   The net rate of snowball production is the rate of building snowballs minus the rate of melting snowballs:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs per hour} - \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \text{ snowballs per hour} - \frac{120}{15} \text{ snowballs per hour} = 20 \text{ snowballs per hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs per hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour}

1245,"To determine how many blueberry cubes Mary makes, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, we can express the number of blueberry cubes as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes made is 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]

Let:
- \( B \) be the number of blue blocks.
- \( Y \) be the number of yellow blocks.
- \( R \) be the number of red blocks.

From the problem, we know:
1. The tower has 4 blue blocks.
2. The tower has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
3. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

We can express the number of yellow blocks in terms of the number of blue blocks:
\[ Y = 2B \]

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ B + Y + R = 32 \]

Substituting \( Y = 2B \) into the total blocks equation:
\[ B + 2B + R = 32 \]
\[ 3B + R = 32 \]

To find the number of red blocks, \( R \), we need to determine the value of \( B \). Since \( B \) must be a positive integer, we solve for \( R \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ R = 32 - 3B \]

Next, we need to ensure that \( R \) is a non-negative integer. This means:
\[ 32 - 3B \geq 0 \]
\[ 32 \geq 3B \]
\[ B \leq \frac{32}{3} \]
\[ B \leq 10.67 \]

Since \( B \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( B \) is 10. We will check if \( B = 10 \) satisfies the equation \( R = 32 - 3B \):
\[ R = 32 - 3 \times 10 \]
\[ R = 32 - 30 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, if \( B = 10 \), then \( R = 2 \). We can verify this solution by substituting back into the total blocks equation:
\[ B + Y + R = 10 + 2 \times 10 + 2 \]
\[ 10 + 20 + 2 = 32 \]

1. Calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in one day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in one week.
3. Subtract the total amount of feed consumed in one week from the initial amount of feed ordered.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in one day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.
- With 5 pigs, the total daily consumption is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed per week.

Now, let's find out how much feed is left after a week:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount left after a week is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.
2. Determine how many packs of hot dogs are required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the hot dogs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.**

John invited 20 people to the party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many packs of hot dogs are required.**

Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \]
Since John can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs 7 packs of hot dogs.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hot dogs.**

Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 7 packs is:

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog:
- The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total number of holes dug by the dog is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) holes.

Next, let's calculate the total number of holes filled by Nate:
- Nate fills in 9 holes a day for 14 days.

To simplify this ratio, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 18:
- \(84 \div 18 = 4\)
- \(126 \div 18 = 7\)

So, the simplified ratio is \(4 : 7\).

This means that for every 4 holes dug by the dog, Nate fills in 7 holes. To find out how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to determine how many sets of 4 holes he can fill in 14 days:

So, the total number of meals ordered per night is:
\[ 6 \text{ reservations} \times 2 \text{ meals/reservation} + 1 \text{ bottle of wine} = 12 + 1 = 13 \text{ meals} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue per night by multiplying the total number of meals by the price per meal:
\[ 13 \text{ meals} \times \$5 \text{ per meal} = \$65 \text{ per night} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we multiply the weekly revenue by 2:
\[ \$65 \text{ per night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = \$130 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:

1313,"To determine the price at which each watermelon was sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$80
   \]

2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon:**
   The vendor sold all 50 watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we first calculate the total selling price and then divide by the number of watermelons sold.

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   The total selling price is the sum of the total cost and the profit. The profit is 25% of the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20
   \]
   Therefore, the total selling price is:
   \[
   \text{Total selling price} = \$80 + \$20 = \$100
   \]

4. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   The selling price per watermelon is the total selling price divided by the number of watermelons sold:
   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \frac{\$100}{50} = \$2
   \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for \(\boxed{2}\) dollars.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
1314,"To determine John's youngest son's age in 3 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora.
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora's current age is \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.
   - Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

2. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John was 32 years old when James was born.
   - Therefore, John's current age is \(32 + 32 = 64\) years old.

3. **Calculate John's youngest son's current age:**
   - John's youngest son is 18 years old.
   - John's youngest son will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old in 3 years.

Thus, John's youngest son will be \(\boxed{21}\) years old in 3 years.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix3PhrasesMathFormat'}
1315,"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each person peels in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana peels in an hour. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in one hour (60 minutes), she will peel:
\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane peels in an hour. Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in one hour, she will peel:
\[
\frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour:
\[
20 - 15 = 5 \text{ oranges}

Therefore, Ana will have peeled \(\boxed{5}\) more oranges than Jane after an hour.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix6PhrasesMathFormat'}
1316,"To determine the total cost Mark paid, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of the new radiator:**
   The original cost of the radiator is $400.

2. **Discount on the radiator:**
   The radiator is sold at a 80% discount. To find the discounted price, we calculate 80% of $400:
   \[
   0.80 \times 400 = 320
   \]
   So, the discounted price of the radiator is $320.

3. **Cost of hiring the mechanic:**
   The mechanic charges $50 per hour. Since the installation takes 3 hours, the total cost for the mechanic is:
   \[
   50 \times 3 = 150
   \]
   So, the cost for hiring the mechanic is $150.

4. **Total cost:**
   To find the total cost, we add the discounted price of the radiator to the cost of hiring the mechanic:
   \[
   320 + 150 = 470
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{470}\).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix2PhrasesMathFormat'}
1317,"To determine the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

Since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows on the farm. Now, we can substitute \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is \(\boxed{5}\).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix4PhrasesMathFormat'}
1318,"To determine how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing them.

First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, the total number of slices is:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing them. There are 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends), so we divide 56 slices by 4 people:
