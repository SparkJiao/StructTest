The text explores various reform elements aimed at improving the solvency of the Social Security program and examines protection options to mitigate the impact of these reforms on vulnerable populations.

[Why is it happening?]: The need for reform is driven by projected financial shortfalls due to demographic changes such as the aging baby boomer population, increased life expectancy, and lower fertility rates. These factors are expected to lead to cash deficits and potential depletion of the Social Security trust funds, necessitating changes to ensure long-term solvency.

[Why is it happening?]: These disparities are occurring because the federal funding mechanisms and oversight for Medicaid and CHIP in the territories are fundamentally different from those in the states. Territories receive a fixed federal matching rate and capped funding, which does not adequately account for their actual healthcare needs or costs. Additionally, the territories face unique challenges such as smaller populations, limited healthcare infrastructure, and higher poverty rates, which further complicate their healthcare funding and administration.

798,"[What is the main point?]: The main point is to discuss the role of specific microRNAs, particularly the miR-200 family, in cancer biology, focusing on their impact on epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell migration, invasion, and chemoresistance, particularly in relation to the transcription factor ZEB1 and the protein TUBB3.

[Why is it happening?]: The interactions and regulatory mechanisms involving miR-200c and ZEB1 are crucial because they influence cancer progression and treatment response. miR-200c typically suppresses ZEB1, which is a promoter of EMT, a process that enhances cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Loss of miR-200c expression leads to increased ZEB1 activity, promoting a more aggressive cancer phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy.

[Who is involved?]: The study involves cancer cells from breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, with specific focus on cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), HEC50 (endometrial cancer), and HEY (ovarian cancer). Researchers are also involved in manipulating and observing the genetic expressions within these cells.
