1. The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems like ratchets are not well understood. Chaotic ratchets display complicated behavior that depends sensitively on parameters.
2. The current in a chaotic ratchet, defined as the time-averaged velocity over an ensemble, depends on the details of the initial ensemble. It is important to discard transients when quantifying the current.
3. While some studies suggested a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior, other results showed current reversals can occur without such bifurcations. The authors aim to clarify the relationship between bifurcations and current.
4. The authors study a specific chaotic ratchet model and construct bifurcation diagrams characterizing the dynamics. They then examine the current for ensembles of trajectories.
5. The current depends significantly on the size, location, and spread of the initial ensemble, especially near bifurcation points. Ensemble results can differ from single trajectory results.
6. Not all bifurcations lead to current reversal, and not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations. However, most current reversals seem to be associated with bifurcations.
7. The authors propose a new heuristic rule: bifurcations correspond to sudden changes (spikes or jumps) in the current, which are not necessarily reversals. Current reversals are a special case of this. The parameter dependence of transport is exaggerated at bifurcation points.
8. While the proposed heuristic captures much of the observed behavior, there are some exceptions that remain open questions. Finding concrete reasons for when the heuristic is valid or violated is an outstanding problem.

1. This work investigates the possibility of additional planets in six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems using dynamical simulations and radial velocity observations. The systems studied are HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 45350, HD 80606, HD 89744, and 16 Cyg B.

2. Test particle simulations were performed to determine regions where additional low-mass planets could remain in stable orbits. The simulations show that there are stable regions detectable by current surveys in these systems.

3. Updated Keplerian orbital solutions are presented for the known planets in HD 3651, HD 37605, HD 80606, and HD 89744 by combining published data with new observations from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. No evidence for additional planets was found in the residuals of the orbital fits.

4. Detection limit calculations were performed using the radial velocity data to place constraints on the presence of additional planets. The tightest limits were obtained for HD 3651, HD 45350, and 16 Cyg B, where planets of a few Neptune masses can be ruled out in the dynamically stable regions.

5. The combination of dynamical simulations and observational detection limits is an effective way to constrain the presence of additional planets in these systems. Overall, the results show no evidence for additional planets, but identify regions where such planets could exist below current detection thresholds.

1. The LEP experiments have tested the Standard Model at the quantum level by measuring the Z-boson decay into fermion pairs, constraining new physics at the Z-pole.
2. A future Z factory like the GigaZ option of the ILC could generate a large number of Z events, allowing the study of rare Z decays sensitive to new physics.
3. This work studies the rare Z decays Z→Aγ, Z→AAA, and Z→AA in the Type-II 2HDM, Lepton-specific 2HDM, NMSSM, and nMSSM models, which predict a light CP-odd Higgs boson A.
4. The structure and particle content of the 2HDM, NMSSM and nMSSM models are described, focusing on the Higgs sector and the couplings of the light CP-odd Higgs A.
5. The rare Z decays are calculated in the four new physics models, including the relevant Feynman diagrams and the radiative corrections.
6. Various theoretical and experimental constraints are considered for the model parameters, such as perturbativity, collider searches, precision electroweak data, flavor physics, and dark matter relic density.
7. The branching ratios of the rare Z decays are presented for the allowed parameter space of the four models. The Z→Aγ and Z→AA decays can reach detectable levels at the GigaZ, while Z→AAA is too small to be observed.
8. The Z→AA decay may help distinguish the NMSSM from the nMSSM at the GigaZ. The decay rates follow a certain pattern among the Type-II 2HDM, NMSSM and nMSSM due to the Yukawa couplings of the light Higgs A.
9. In the nMSSM, a very light Higgs A below 1 GeV is still allowed, leading to rare Z decays like Z→AAA→(μ+μ-)(μ+μ-)(μ+μ-) which may be detectable at the GigaZ with further studies.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It predicts the existence of superpartners of SM particles.

2. The no-scale type Kähler potential, where the hidden and observable sectors are separated, leads to vanishing scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings, with gaugino masses being the only source of SUSY breaking. This scenario is predictive and can suppress SUSY contributions to flavor-changing neutral currents.

3. Phenomenological aspects of the no-scale scenario have been investigated, considering direct search bounds, cosmological constraints, and the lightest Higgs mass and branching ratio for b → sγ. Almost all parameter regions are excluded when universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale.

4. When the boundary condition is given above the GUT scale, a relatively large parameter region is allowed. Non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale can also avoid cosmological constraints, with wino, higgsino, or sneutrino potentially being the LSP.

5. The Higgs mass bound and b → sγ constraint are important when the higgsino-like neutralino is the LSP. The wino LSP and sneutrino LSP cases are less constrained, but the mass difference between the LSP and parent particles is small, requiring unusual acceptance cuts.

6. The no-scale type boundary conditions are obtained in various SUSY models and are attractive due to their predictive power and potential to solve the SUSY flavor problem. Current constraints from Higgs mass, b → sγ, direct searches, and cosmology significantly limit the allowed parameter space, especially for the minimal scenario with universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale.

1. The paper analyzes the stability of quasiregular (QR) singularities in the cross-polarized Bell-Szekeres (CPBS) spacetime using test fields.
2. Test electromagnetic (EM) fields applied to the CPBS background spacetime show that the QR singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable and transforms into a non-scalar curvature singularity.
3. Test scalar fields have a stronger effect on the QR singularity compared to EM fields, transforming it into a scalar curvature singularity.
4. An exact back-reaction solution representing the collision of cross-polarized EM fields coupled to a scalar field confirms the prediction of the conjecture for the scalar field case.
5. Test null dusts introduced into the interaction region of the CPBS spacetime also lead to the instability of the Cauchy horizon and its transformation into a scalar curvature singularity.
6. The Riemann tensor components in local and parallel propagated orthonormal (PPON) frames are evaluated to determine the type of singularity in the incoming region of the CPBS spacetime.
7. Weyl and Maxwell scalars are calculated for the collision of null shells in the background of the CPBS spacetime.

1. The text discusses three types of non-classical correlations for bipartite quantum systems: non-separability (entanglement), EPR-steering, and Bell-nonlocality. These form a hierarchy, with Bell-nonlocal states being a strict subset of EPR-steerable states, which are a strict subset of entangled states.

2. The authors investigate EPR-steerability for two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals, called T-states. They use the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism to develop a deterministic local hidden state (LHS) model for projective measurements on T-states.

3. The authors conjecture that their LHS model provides a necessary and sufficient condition for T-states to be EPR-steerable. They also derive two sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability of T-states using EPR-steering inequalities.

4. The necessary condition from the LHS model and the sufficient conditions from the EPR-steering inequalities are close to each other for most T-states, supporting the conjecture that the LHS model condition is both necessary and sufficient for EPR-steerability.

5. The authors prove a theorem relating their LHS model to the quantum steering ellipsoid. The theorem allows the necessary condition for EPR-steerability to be expressed in terms of the harmonic mean radius of the steering ellipsoid.

6. Two EPR-steering inequalities are derived that provide sufficient conditions for EPR-steerability of arbitrary two-qubit states. One inequality is based on the spin covariance matrix and the other is a nonlinear inequality.

7. Proving the optimality of the LHS model for T-states and extending it to arbitrary two-qubit states and POVM measurements are left as open problems. The quantum steering ellipsoid may provide intuition for these generalizations.

8. The appendices provide proofs of the theorem relating the LHS model to the steering ellipsoid and the linear EPR-steering inequality based on the spin covariance matrix. Explicit formulas are given for the LHS model and steering ellipsoid.

1. The idea of using electron spin to encode binary information was first proposed in the mid-1990s, with potential advantages of lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation compared to charge-based devices.
2. In 1994, a scheme was proposed for realizing a classical NAND gate using three spins in a weak magnetic field, where the spin orientation becomes a binary variable.
3. A serious problem with the proposed spintronic logic gates is that exchange interaction is bidirectional and cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals, leading to metastable states.
4. In 1996, a solution using a three-phase clock was proposed to enforce unidirectionality, but it requires fabricating gate pads between cells, which is a major lithography challenge.
5. Spintronic logic gates dissipate a minimum of kT ln 2 energy per bit flip, which would lead to high power dissipation exceeding current chip power densities.
6. To overcome the power dissipation challenge, reversible logic gates not constrained by the Landauer kT ln 2 barrier were proposed, such as the single spin parametron and universal quantum gates using exchange-coupled spins.
7. Spin coherence times in solids are much larger than charge coherence times, making spin the preferred vehicle to encode qubits in solids.
8. All-optical quantum computing using spin has emerged as a viable idea, with the advantage of optical read out not requiring contacts to individual quantum dots.
9. Recent experimental progress has been made in reading the spin state of an electron in a quantum dot using circularly polarized light, making optical read out a more practical approach compared to electrical read out.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binaries containing a white dwarf primary and low mass main sequence secondary. The observed orbital period distribution of CVs shows a sharp cut-off around 77 minutes, which theoretical models have been unable to reproduce.

2. The authors investigate ways to increase the minimum orbital period by increasing the mass transfer rate through consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) and by introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population.

3. Detailed calculations of the long-term evolution of CVs are presented. The authors find that even maximal efficient CAML cannot sufficiently increase the minimum period to match observations. Donor stars that are significantly bloated due to tidal deformation are needed to obtain a minimum period of 77 minutes.

4. The authors synthesize various model CV populations and test them against the observed period distribution using a modified chi-squared test. None of the model populations fit as well as a distribution that is simply flat in orbital period.

5. Models designed to wash out the accumulation of systems near the minimum period (period spike) by introducing a large spread of CAML efficiency generally perform better than models based on a large spread of donor star deformation factors. Model populations where all CVs form at long orbital periods give a much better fit than those that include CVs born with small donor masses.

6. The authors conclude that the period minimum problem and period spike problem remain open issues. While it is possible to construct model populations where the period spike is sufficiently washed out, an unambiguous fit to the observed period distribution is still lacking.

1. Powerful H2 emission detected by Appleton et al. (2006) represents only a small fraction of the group-wide warm H2 emission that dominates the mid-infrared emission of Stephan's Quintet. There is evidence for another shock-excited feature called the ""H2 bridge"".

2. The global L(H2)/LX-ray ratio in the main shock is >3, confirming that mid-IR H2 lines are a stronger coolant than X-ray emission over the shock structures. This modifies the traditional view that X-rays dominate cooling in the later stages of compact group evolution.

3. Infrared ionic lines are interpreted as being produced by fast (100-300 km/s) ionizing shocks. Comparison between line intensities implies that silicon and iron are depleted onto dust, suggesting dust is not destroyed in the shock.

4. Star formation in Stephan's Quintet is dominated by SQ-A and 7318b-south, located at the ends of the radio shock ridge, suggesting they are shock triggered starbursts. However, regions dominated by warm H2 emission exhibit very low star formation rates.

5. The projected coexistence of [SiII] and H2 emission produced by 200 km/s and 20 km/s velocity shocks, respectively, is observed. The results are consistent with a model of a multiphase postshock medium produced by a galaxy-wide collision. The cooling pathway of warm H2 emission is a significant mechanism in shock systems.

1. The paper presents new models of marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) protoplanetary disks to study the mixing and transport of isotopic heterogeneity, such as from supernova injection of short-lived radioisotopes or UV photodissociation.
2. The models use a 3D hydrodynamics code to follow the evolution of a color field representing the heterogeneity in disks around protostars with masses ranging from 0.1 to 1 solar mass.
3. Single-shot injection models show that initial isotopic heterogeneity is rapidly reduced to dispersions of ~1-2% in the outer disk and ~10-20% in the inner disk.
4. Continuous injection models representing ongoing UV photolysis result in higher dispersions of ~20% that persist for longer times.
5. The degree of mixing is insensitive to the exact initial conditions and is primarily determined by the disk's MGU evolution.
6. Mixing timescales are longer for disks around lower-mass M dwarf protostars due to their longer orbital periods.
7. The models are consistent with observations of crystalline silicates and refractory grains at large distances in protoplanetary disks, which require outward transport.
8. MGU disk phases may drive FU Orionis outbursts and explain the homogeneity of 26Al/27Al ratios and heterogeneity of 16O/17O ratios in the solar nebula.

2. Two populations of type 1 AGN are identified based on the FWHM of H-beta lines: Population A (FWHM 1000-4000 km/s) and Population B (FWHM 4000-12000 km/s). Population A sources rarely show systematic red or blue shifts of the broad H-beta line.

5. Analysis of composite spectra of bright SDSS quasars binned by FWHM H-beta and FeII strength shows no evidence for systematic FeII redshifts relative to H-beta or [OIII]. Median composites generated from the H08 sample for sources with the largest claimed FeII redshifts are consistent with zero shift for Population A and poorly constrained for Population B.

However, with increased interband coupling or scattering, this signature rapidly disappears. Impurities in the π-band primarily affect the nonlinearity at higher temperatures.

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is a unique property that plays an important role in quantum information processing, but it is affected by decoherence.
2. Studies have shown rich dynamical behaviors of entanglement under decoherence, including entanglement sudden death (ESD), revival, and preservation of residual entanglement.
3. The lost entanglement of qubits can be transferred to reservoirs, leading to entanglement sudden birth (ESB) in the reservoirs.
4. In a system of two qubits locally interacting with two amplitude-damping reservoirs, an identity about the entanglement distribution among bipartite subsystems is found to be satisfied at any time.
5. The entanglement distribution depends on the properties of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit, with the identity being independent of these details.
6. When reservoirs are photonic band gap (PBG) media, stable entanglement distribution among all bipartite subsystems is possible if the qubit and reservoir form a bound state and non-Markovian effects are important.
7. ESD of qubits is not always accompanied by ESB of reservoirs, contrary to previous findings.
8. The stable entanglement distribution resulting from bound states is a general phenomenon in open quantum systems when non-Markovian effects are considered.
9. The identity about entanglement distribution reveals the profound physics of entanglement dynamics under decoherence and implies a way to protect entanglement via quantum reservoir engineering.

1. The origin of celestial gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an important unexplained astrophysical phenomenon. GRBs are powerful flashes of gamma-rays lasting from less than a second to tens of seconds, observed by satellites, and are thought to be associated with the emission of gravitational waves (GWs). The Rome group operates two resonant bar GW detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, and launched a program to study correlations between GRB events detected by BeppoSAX and the output signals from these detectors.

2. Using a cross-correlation method applied to data from Explorer and Nautilus, the authors determined new experimental upper limits for the GW burst intensity causing correlations with GRBs. Analyzing data over 47 GRBs, they exclude the presence of signals of a certain amplitude with 95% probability, improving on previous upper limits. The result is also presented in terms of scaled likelihood and sensitivity bound. The method can be applied for any expected delay between GRB and GW according to the chosen model.

1. The paper presents a model for the growth of two coupled networks, such as scientific citation networks or the web of human sexual contacts, where new nodes join each network at each time step and form intra-network and inter-network (cross) links.

2. Using a rate equation approach, the authors derive the time evolution of the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links in each network, and obtain the total, intra-link, and cross-link degree distributions, which follow power-law forms with exponents depending on model parameters.

3. In the weak coupling case where cross-linking is negligible, the model recovers previously observed power-law exponents for scientific citation networks. For the web of human sexual contacts, the model can reproduce empirically observed power-law exponents for degree distributions of males and females when cross-links are predominant.

1. The theoretical description of hadron production at large transverse momentum in high energy collisions traditionally involves a hard parton scattering followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron. The fragmentation process is described by fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
2. This production mechanism is found to be inadequate for intermediate transverse momentum particles in heavy-ion collisions. Recombination of partons is shown to be a more appropriate hadronization process, especially when soft partons are involved.
3. The authors introduce the notion of shower partons and their momentum distributions in order to represent the fragmentation functions in terms of recombination. The shower parton distributions (SPDs) are determined from the fragmentation functions using the recombination model.
4. A closed set of integral equations relating the fragmentation functions to the SPDs is set up and solved to obtain the SPDs for light quarks, strange quarks, and gluons. The SPDs are found to reproduce the fragmentation functions well.
5. The SPDs are useful in problems where fragmentation functions alone are insufficient, such as when a hard parton is produced in a thermal parton environment in heavy-ion collisions. Thermal-shower recombination is shown to dominate over fragmentation in the production of intermediate transverse momentum pions.
6. The SPDs are also used to study dihadron distributions in a jet, which exhibit significant correlations that cannot be described by factorizable fragmentation functions alone.
7. The authors argue that recombination is the basic hadronization process, even for fragmentation in vacuum, and that it is sensible to use the recombination framework for all transverse momenta in heavy-ion collisions.
8. While the SPDs obtained are model-dependent and can be improved, their availability is important for phenomenological applications involving the interaction of shower partons with the medium in heavy-ion collisions. Further work on the Q2 evolution of the SPDs is suggested.

7. To implement the symmetry needed for flavor projection, a third complex (12c complex) is introduced, complementary to the original in certain subspaces.
8. A fourth complex (12cd complex), the dual of the 12c complex, is required to complete the description of flavor projection.
9. Chiral and flavor projection cannot be implemented simultaneously using the formulation as it stands, so a duplicate set of complexes is introduced, with chiral projection mapping between sets and flavor projection within sets.

2. Auxiliary fields and the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme are used to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. A well-suited coordinate system allows conformal-invariant CFS formulas to take a Minkowskian form.

3. The main result is a set of Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields. The paper explains the geometrical construction of CFS, defines the fields and their dynamical equations.

4. The dynamical system is solved, the quantum field is explicitly constructed, and the two-point functions are written down. The infinitesimal conformal action on the fields is expanded.

5. As an example, the case of de Sitter space is considered, and simple expressions for the two-point functions related to the fields on de Sitter space are obtained. The two-point function has the same physical content as the Allen and Jacobson two-point function.

A distinct sequence of events is considered, including the expansion of an optically thick pair plasma, engulfment of baryonic matter, and interactions with the circumburst medium.
2. Short GRBs (S-GRBs) with energy > 10^52 erg are associated with NS-NS mergers leading to black hole formation, while short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs) with energy < 10^52 erg produce a massive NS. S-GRBs are characterized by an initial thermal emission (P-GRB), a prompt emission, and a GeV emission.
3. GRB 090510 is analyzed as a prototype S-GRB. The P-GRB spectrum is best-fitted by a comptonized component, interpreted as thermal spectra from a dyadotorus. The prompt emission reveals CBM inhomogeneities with an average density of 1 particle/cm^3, typical of galactic halos.
4. The GeV emission in GRB 090510 occurs after the P-GRB and is one of the most intense ever observed in a GRB. It is explained by accretion of matter onto the newly-formed Kerr black hole, with beaming angles inferred from the accreted mass.

1. The simplest way to predict physics beyond the Standard Model is to perform global fits to precision measurements. The predicted W boson mass is strongly correlated with the measured top quark mass.
2. In models with Higgs particles in representations other than SU(2) doublets and singlets, there are more parameters than in the Standard Model. The SM tree level relation ρ=1 no longer holds and extra input parameters are required.
3. The authors give two examples, a model with a real scalar triplet and a left-right symmetric model, where the Standard Model is not recovered when the scale of new physics becomes much larger than the electroweak scale. This demonstrates that the SM cannot be split into a SM contribution plus a piece that vanishes at large scales.
4. In the triplet Higgs model, the dependence of the W boson mass on the top quark mass becomes logarithmic rather than quadratic as in the SM. The scalar fields are non-decoupling and must be included in any effective field theory analysis.
5. In the left-right symmetric model, the contribution of the lightest neutral Higgs boson depends quadratically on its mass and is suppressed by the heavy gauge boson masses. The triplet Higgs is also non-decoupling in this model.
6. The authors emphasize the importance of performing the renormalization correctly according to the electroweak structure of the new models. Taking the triplet mass to infinity does not recover the SM due to the non-decoupling of the triplet scalar field.

The logic of computers that communicate with each other in a feedback loop is modeled using open machines, which are Turing machines modified to be stepped by a clock and to communicate with external devices. Logical synchronization between open machines requires that a symbol arrive within the writing phase of the receiving machine's cycle.

3. Spacetime curvature affects the possible arrangements of channels and echo counts between five or more open machines. Frozen arrangements, where an echo count to a machine cannot be changed without altering another echo count to that machine, depend on the Weyl curvature of the spacetime. Bit rates are constrained by variability in spacetime curvature.

4. Steering open machines toward aiming points for logical synchronization involves measuring deviations in phases and positions, which are subject to quantum uncertainty. Hypothesized metric tensor fields used to define aiming points may need to be revised based on measured deviations outside of tolerances. Arrangements of open machines could potentially detect slow changes in spacetime curvature.

1. The paper analyzes the performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard in non-beacon enabled mode at varying data rates of 20 kbps, 40 kbps and 250 kbps. The performance is evaluated in terms of load, delay, throughput and end-to-end delay with different MAC parameters and with acknowledgement (ACK) enabled and disabled. The analysis shows that IEEE 802.15.4 performs best at the higher 250 kbps data rate with negligible delay and high throughput.

2. The paper also examines the performance with and without ACK. Without ACK, there are fewer collisions and lower delay, resulting in increased throughput compared to the ACK enabled case, especially at the 40 kbps data rate. The authors plan to investigate the performance further by changing frequency bands at different data rates and examining the effect of modifying the inner structure of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer.

1. MOPED is an algorithm for compressing data and speeding up likelihood function evaluation in astronomical data analysis. It is particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix depends on the model parameters.
2. MOPED has limitations and does not always accurately represent the likelihood function, especially for multimodal and degenerate distributions. The authors demonstrate cases where MOPED fails to portray the true likelihood.
3. MOPED compresses N data points into m (typically m << N), allowing much faster likelihood evaluation. However, the authors show that MOPED can create false likelihood peaks equal in magnitude to the true peak.
4. The validity of likelihood peaks can be checked by comparing the original likelihood values at those points. Bayesian evidence cannot be calculated from the MOPED likelihood. Using multiple fiducial models and averaging the log-likelihood can mitigate the false peak problem.
5. MOPED can provide significant computational benefits, but it is important to verify that it has accurately represented the likelihood function before relying on its results. Some solutions to the limitations are presented, but they come with tradeoffs like increased SNR thresholds for signal recovery.

1. The cosmological constant problem is a major puzzle in particle physics, involving the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted large vacuum energy density and the observed small value of the cosmological constant. Various sources contribute to the vacuum energy density, including zero point energies of particles and potential energies from symmetry breaking.

2. The author suggests that a dominant part of dark energy could originate from gravitational corrections to the vacuum energy, under the assumption that classical gravitational fields do not effectively couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy. This is despite the coupling between gravitons and matter at the microscopic level. The author proposes a kind of exclusion principle for external gravitons to justify this assumption.

3. If the proposed gravitational corrections to the vacuum energy of the terascale (~TeV^4) dominate the dark energy, it could lead to interesting scenarios involving dark matter and supersymmetry. The evolution of this dark energy density would vary logarithmically with the temperature of the universe, described by a van der Waals type equation of state. However, the stability of such a model remains uncertain and requires further investigation at a more fundamental level.

3. Later theoretical studies using various methods like LCAO and finite element method revisited the question of H3+ stability but did not find a bound state. Accurate ab initio results demonstrating the non-existence of H3+ are scarce.

The μ parameter that gives rise to neutrino masses is generated at one-loop level and is naturally small without requiring the triplet scalars to be very heavy. The model predicts a distinctive collider signature of two jets plus missing transverse energy with the invariant mass of two jets being the mass of the doubly-charged Higgs boson.

6. Clusters with star formation efficiencies below 30% can become completely unbound and dissolve after gas expulsion. This ""infant mortality"" of young clusters has been suggested to explain the excess of very young clusters seen in some galaxies.

2. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on a Ni80Zr20 alloy model to investigate the glass transition. The critical temperature Tc was estimated using different approaches: from the temperature dependence of nonergodicity parameters, the α-relaxation times, and the diffusion coefficients. The Tc estimates from the liquid and glassy states differed by around 50 K, a much smaller discrepancy compared to some other models. Overall, Tc was estimated to be around 1000 K for this system.

1. Dyadic data are common in psychosocial and behavioral studies, where observations refer to both persons involved in a dyadic relationship. Members of dyads often influence each other's cognitions, emotions and behaviors, leading to interdependence.
2. Longitudinal dyadic data are prone to missing data problems caused by dropout. Conventional statistical methods may be invalid in the presence of nonignorable dropouts.
3. The authors propose a fully Bayesian approach to deal with longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts based on a selection model. They model each subject's longitudinal measurement process using a transition model and account for within-dyad correlation using dyad-specific random effects.
4. To accommodate nonignorable dropouts, the authors take the selection model approach by directly modeling the relationship between the dropout process and missing outcomes using a discrete time survival model.
5. The authors conducted simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method substantially outperformed complete-case and available-case analyses, yielding estimates with smaller bias and coverage rates close to the nominal level.
6. The authors applied the proposed method to a longitudinal metastatic breast cancer study. The method identified significant ""partner"" effects, suggesting that patients and spouses are highly interdependent and influence each other's depression status.
7. The authors conducted sensitivity analyses to examine how the inference changes with respect to the values of parameters linking the missing outcome with the dropout process. The estimates were generally quite stable.
8. Compared to complete-case and available-case analyses, the proposed approach detected more ""partner"" effects, providing extra insights into the interdependence of the dyads. This information can be useful for designing more efficient depression prevention programs.
9. The authors discuss potential extensions of the proposed dropout model, such as including time-dependent random effects and putting hierarchical structures on coefficients of common covariates.
10. The authors conclude that the proposed selection-model-based approach is effective for analyzing longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts, providing appealing interpretations of ""actor"" and ""partner"" effects that facilitate understanding interdependence within relationships.

2. Lifshitz generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics, showing that two plates made of the same material always attract, while plates of different materials can repel each other if immersed in a properly chosen liquid.
3. Parsegian, Weiss and Barash derived equations for the van der Waals interaction energy and torque between two dielectrically anisotropic plates, showing that a torque develops causing the plates to spontaneously rotate to align their principal axes.
4. The authors calculate the magnitude of the quantum fluctuation-induced torque between a small birefringent disk and a birefringent plate in vacuum, finding it to be within the sensitivity of available instrumentation at sub-micron plate-disk separations.
5. To avoid the technical difficulties of maintaining the disk at sub-micron distances from the plate in vacuum, the authors propose immersing the plate in liquid ethanol and placing the disk on top, where it would levitate due to repulsive van der Waals forces and be free to rotate.
6. Numerical calculations show that the torque between the birefringent disk and plate persists in ethanol, with a magnitude of ~10^-19 N·m at a separation of 100 nm.
7. The authors propose an experiment where the levitating disk is initially rotated by transfer of angular momentum from a laser beam, and the time evolution of its rotation back to the equilibrium orientation is monitored to demonstrate the effect of the quantum fluctuation-induced torque.
8. Definitive signatures of the quantum fluctuation-induced torque would be its periodicity of 180° in the disk orientation and the dependence of the rotation direction on the choice of disk material (quartz vs. calcite).

2. The authors set up a framework for studying topologically biased random walks (TBRW) on graphs, which can be used for community detection and synchronization in complex networks.
3. The transition probabilities for biased random walks are defined based on vertex or edge properties of the graph. Mathematical tools like perturbation methods and parametric equations of motion are developed to investigate the ""bias parameter"" space.
4. The behavior of the spectral gap (difference between first and second eigenvalues) in biased random walks is studied. Conditions for maximal spectral gap are defined and numerical evidence suggests this maximum is global.
5. An invariant quantity is presented for the biased random walk that depends only on topology for a broad class of biased walks.
6. A general methodology is proposed for applying different TBRW strategies to the problem of community finding in complex networks.
7. The authors examine the determinant of the transition matrix as a function of bias parameters and find that a certain quantity is a topological constant independent of the choice of parameters and vertex biases.
8. The methodology is tested on Girvan-Newman benchmark networks. The number of communities is found to be related to the number of eigenvalues in a ""community band"" separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum.
9. Two-parameter biased random walks are used, with degree and edge multiplicity as the biasing properties. Optimal bias parameters are chosen to maximize the gap between the ""community band"" and the rest of the eigenvalues while shrinking the spectral gap.
10. The authors conclude that TBRW is a promising approach for community detection in complex networks. Different strategies may be optimal for different types of networks. TBRW could also potentially describe the feedback between function and topology in dynamical networks like biological systems.

3. Each phagocyte manages a group of P2P hosts by monitoring their connection patterns and traffic to detect worm events. Upon detection, local isolation, alert propagation and software patching are invoked.

1. Open dielectric resonators have numerous applications and are paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths.
2. A trace formula for 2D dielectric resonators was recently developed and successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics. However, typical microlasers are 3D systems and there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3D dielectric resonators.
3. Experiments were performed with two circular dielectric microwave resonators of different thickness. The results can be directly applied to dielectric microcavities in the optical frequency regime if the ratio of wavelength and resonator size are similar.
4. The resonators are described by the vectorial Helmholtz equation with outgoing-wave boundary conditions. For the infinite slab geometry, the equation can be simplified by separating the wave vector into vertical and parallel components, leading to the definition of an effective index of refraction.
5. The density of states in a dielectric resonator can be separated into a smooth, average part described by the Weyl formula, and a fluctuating part related to the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical billiard.
6. The resonance spectra of the two circular microwave resonators were measured and the corresponding length spectra were investigated. The experimental length spectra showed good agreement with a combination of the semiclassical trace formula and a 2D approximation using an effective index of refraction.
7. The positions of peaks in the experimental length spectrum are slightly shifted with respect to the geometrical lengths of the periodic orbits. This is related to the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and a systematic inaccuracy of the 2D approximation.

There are also some deviations between experimental length spectra and trace formula predictions due to the systematic error of the effective index approximation.

7. The size of the ground state configurations crosses over from compact at small Q to stretched at large Q. Averages over all Q grow at least as fast as self-avoiding walks.
8. Annealed PAs, where charges can rearrange to minimize energy, expel excess charge into ""fingers"" to form compact cores with alternating charges.
9. An analogy is drawn between compact PAs and charged liquid drops, which become unstable to splitting when the charge exceeds the Rayleigh limit. The Rayleigh charge scales differently with N below and above d=3.

2. The alloys are found to be half-metallic over a wide range of lattice parameters. Exceptions occur for alloys involving S, Se and Te at low lattice parameters, where antiferromagnetic exchange interactions indicate ground states to be antiferromagnetic or have complex magnetic structure.

3. Mixed pnictide-chalcogenide alloys CrAs0.5X0.5 (X= S, Se, Te) do not show tendencies for antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations over the entire range of lattice parameters studied. Varying the pnictogen and chalcogen concentrations to achieve lattice-matching with a substrate while maintaining a half-metallic ferromagnetic state is possible.

4. Large variations in the Curie temperature occur in the alloys as the lattice parameter is varied. Changing the carrier concentrations can bring about large changes in the Curie temperature. Pnictides generally have a higher Curie temperature than chalcogenides.

5. The Curie temperature, lattice Fourier transform of exchange interactions, and stability analysis are based on exchange interactions between Cr atoms only. For ferromagnetic reference states this causes errors due to neglecting effects of induced moments, while disordered local moment results are free from such errors.

5. An algorithm is presented for labeling the vertices of a connected graph. This algorithm plays a key role in proving the main result.
6. The main theorem states that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow. This implies that a graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and its connected components are narrow.

Optical lattices are artificial crystals of light formed by interfering laser beams, and atoms can be cooled and trapped in the periodic potential wells. The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in cold atoms led to the realization of the superfluid to Mott insulator transition in optical lattices.

By tuning parameters like the lattice depth, tunneling rate, and on-site interactions, various ground states and spin configurations can be realized. Including inter-site interactions extends the model beyond the standard Hubbard Hamiltonian. The increasing experimental control over cold atoms in optical lattices makes it a promising platform to simulate and investigate phenomena from condensed matter physics.

Choosing these bundles and analyzing the scaling of the DOS maximum and resonance energy with basis size allows extrapolating to obtain accurate resonance energies.

The spin resonance peak in inelastic neutron scattering appears below the superconducting transition temperature for the s+- state due to the sign change of the order parameter between hole and electron Fermi surface sheets.

3. Recent ARPES and Andreev spectroscopy measurements show at least two distinct superconducting gaps in most Fe-based superconductors.

Using decimation and renormalization, they show that in the non-interacting regime, there exists a resonance energy at which the impurities are transparent and states around this energy are delocalized.

2. Considering a weakly interacting Bose gas confined on the 2D-DRDM potential, the authors show that the disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and fraction as a function of disorder strength, and enhances both near the resonance energy of the single-particle Hamiltonian. The dependence on interaction strength is explained by including the effect of the healing length.

3. To quantify the delocalization of the interacting ground state, the authors define a many-body inverse participation ratio (IPR) with respect to a homogeneous condensate basis. The IPR has a minimum vs. impurity percentage, indicating a resonance induced by the correlated disorder. This minimum shifts with interaction strength due to the healing length effect, as explained by a mode-matching argument.

4. The authors study the scaling of the IPR with system size. At the resonance condition, the IPR is size-independent, indicating a spatially homogeneous condensate. Away from resonance, the IPR shows ""super-delocalization"" at low impurity percentage and localization at high percentage. The condensate fraction is also enhanced and size-independent at resonance for the 2D-DRDM compared to uncorrelated disorder.

5. In summary, the 2D-DRDM, a short-range correlated disorder model, can induce delocalization and coherence enhancement in a weakly interacting Bose gas, with the effects driven by a resonance condition modified by the interaction healing length.

Quark models can be used to estimate hadronic matrix elements that relate quark operators to the effective hadronic parameterizations of the time reversal violating interaction.

3. The constituent quark model, supplemented with relativistic effects, is used to evaluate matrix elements and relate quark operators to effective hadronic operators. The resulting factors reflect nucleon structure effects due to spin, isospin, and different mass scales.

4. Similar results are obtained using other quark models such as the MIT bag model and a relativistic model with linear confining potential. The factors appearing in the rho-type exchange may be related to the anomalous coupling. Including this anomalous coupling might give a bound closer to the more fundamental quark degrees of freedom.

1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies. A plausible explosion model involves a white dwarf in a binary system accreting material from a companion star and exploding when it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit.
2. Observational confirmation of the companion star remaining near the explosion site would support this evolutionary scenario. A G2IV star was identified as a possible companion of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) based on its velocity and distance.
3. The authors propose a direct method to prove a companion star is located inside the SN ejecta by looking for broad blue wings in absorption lines caused by the expanding ejecta. They focus on Fe I absorption lines in the visible range.
4. Calculations are performed to estimate the amount of Fe I in Tycho's SNR ejecta and predict the spectra of a star at the center of the SNR. The distinct absorption features could identify the companion star.
5. The probability of a non-companion star being inside the ejecta by chance is estimated to be very low based on the expected stellar mass density near Tycho's SNR.
6. Factors that could reduce or erase the distinct absorption features include uncertainty in the number of ionizing photons from the shocked ejecta and the assumption of immediate ionization to higher states in the shocked region.
7. Despite these uncertainties, every SN Ia should have a period where the companion star exhibits the distinct Fe I absorption features before the ejecta cool and recombine.

1. Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information processing that can be characterized independently of its physical realization. Quantifying entanglement is straightforward for pure bipartite states using the entropy of entanglement, but becomes more challenging for mixed states of open quantum systems that interact with their environment.

2. The authors analyze the entanglement dynamics of two cascaded qubits coupled through photon exchange using quantum trajectory theory, which follows the system's evolution conditioned on measurement records of the environment. They find the system exhibits bimodal behavior at resonance, either evolving to a maximally entangled Bell state or undergoing sustained stochastic switching between two Bell states.

3. The results demonstrate that the density matrix alone does not provide a complete description of entanglement in open systems, as it discards information about the system's entanglement with the environment. Quantum trajectories can provide additional insight by considering the process generating the mixed state and allowing for a conditional dynamics based on classical information extracted from the environment.

1. The paper uses a sample of quasars and radio galaxies at z~1 to study the intrinsic anisotropy of infrared emission from the dust torus in AGN.
2. Average SEDs were calculated for the quasar (type 1 AGN) and radio galaxy (type 2 AGN) samples. The ratio of type 1 to type 2 emission decreases from 20 to 2 between 2-8 μm, with more isotropic emission at longer wavelengths.
3. The intrinsic type 1 to type 2 ratio is ~1.44 at 15 μm, which needs to be accounted for in IR-selected flux-limited samples. 
4. Analysis of the 10 μm silicate feature shows an emission peak at 10.5 μm and absorption peak at 9.8 μm, consistent with previous studies.
5. The observed anisotropy is consistent with upper limits from the X-ray/mid-IR correlation of local Seyfert galaxies, but shows some discrepancy with a study of nearby Seyferts by Hönig et al. (2011).
6. If the discrepancy is real, it suggests nearby radio-quiet lower-luminosity AGN have higher IR anisotropy than luminous radio-loud sources, possibly explained by a receding torus model with luminosity-dependent obscuration.
7. The relatively small degree of anisotropy overall is consistent with the torus being clumpy rather than smooth. Clumpy torus models reproduce the observed type 1/type 2 ratio reasonably well.

2. The authors propose an attacking scheme called LO intensity attack (LOIA) where Eve can exploit LO intensity fluctuations to gain information without being detected if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.

3. The secret key rate is calculated for CVQKD with and without Bob monitoring the LO intensity, showing that LO intensity fluctuations can severely compromise the secret key rate if not properly accounted for, especially over long distances.

4. For reverse reconciliation, even small LO intensity fluctuations can allow Eve to obtain full secret keys without being detected. Direct reconciliation is less sensitive but can still be compromised.

5. To ensure security, it is crucial to carefully monitor LO intensity fluctuations in practical CVQKD implementations and scale measurements with instantaneous LO intensity values. Using average LO intensity is insufficient.

2. The authors propose a new model where radio jets from the galactic nucleus plow through the interstellar medium and inflate large bubbles of neutral hydrogen gas, forming the observed HI supershells. This model can resolve the energy problem and explain symmetric HI features in some galaxies.

3. The model is applied to the galaxy NGC 3556, which has two large, symmetric HI supershells that are difficult to explain by other models. Jet parameters inferred for the galaxy NGC 4258 are adopted to show the feasibility of the jet-inflated bubble model for NGC 3556.

4. The radio jets are expected to be short-lived (10^7 - 10^8 years) compared to the lifetimes of the HI supershells (few x 10^8 years). Therefore, the jets may have already faded in galaxies with observed HI supershells. Recurrent jet activity could lead to bubbles at various locations in the disk.

5. The jet-inflated bubble model supplements the existing models for HI supershells and may be particularly relevant for explaining extraordinarily large, symmetric, or highly energetic shells in gas-rich galaxies. The model suggests that past nuclear activity can continue to influence the evolution of galaxy disks long after the active phase has ended.

1. The first color-magnitude diagrams of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I showed features similar to globular clusters, leading to the interpretation that it was a pure Population II system. However, the discovery of carbon stars indicated the presence of an intermediate-age population.
2. New HST observations of Leo I presented in this paper reach about 2 magnitudes deeper than previous ground-based photometry. The data was reduced using ALLFRAME and DoPHOT programs and calibrated using ground-based photometry.
3. The color-magnitude diagram of Leo I shows a steep blue red giant branch indicative of low metallicity, a well-defined red clump characteristic of an intermediate-age population, and a main sequence reaching within 1 mag of the red clump, confirming a considerable population with ages between 1-5 Gyr.
4. Artificial star tests were performed to assess photometric errors. Isochrones from the Padova and Yale libraries were compared to the observed CMD to interpret the stellar populations.
5. The broad main sequence turnoff region indicates star formation has occurred from 10-15 Gyr ago until less than 1 Gyr ago in a more or less continuous manner. The lack of a conspicuous horizontal branch suggests the fraction of stars older than 10 Gyr is small.
6. Bright yellow stars are observed that could be a few hundred Myr old blue loop stars. Some may be short-period classical Cepheids rather than anomalous Cepheids.
7. The width of the RGB could be due to the age dispersion alone, implying negligible metallicity dispersion. Alternatively, considering both age and metallicity effects on isochrone colors, the maximum metallicity range is estimated as Z=0.0001-0.004, increasing with time.
8. In summary, Leo I is a unique dwarf spheroidal galaxy with the youngest stellar population and star formation until almost the present time without distinct bursts. Further observations and analysis using synthetic CMDs will provide more quantitative information on its star formation history and variable star population.

2. The effective interactions between colloids in an electric field can be modeled as a sum of electrostatic repulsions and dipolar attractions. The Clausius-Mosotti factor determines the strength of the dipolar interactions.
3. Experiments were performed on polystyrene latex particles of various sizes (757-2070 nm) in dilute aqueous suspensions under rotating electric fields. The lattice spacing of the 2D colloidal crystals was measured.
4. Monte Carlo simulations were used to model the colloidal crystals, with particles interacting via the derived effective potential. The lattice spacing was determined from the pair correlation function.
5. Simulation results were compared with experimental data by fitting the Debye screening length. The minimum in the effective potential provides a first approximation to the lattice spacing.
6. The lattice spacing decreases with increasing electric field strength, in agreement between experiments and simulations. Some deviations are observed at low and high field strengths.
7. The Debye length does not change significantly with particle size, while the contact potential of the Yukawa repulsion has an approximate inverse cubic dependence on particle diameter.
8. The dipolar attraction strength has a cubic dependence on particle size. Smaller particles require higher field strengths to form stable crystalline rafts.
9. The tunability of the lattice spacing was investigated for various particle sizes. Maximum tunability was found for particles in the range of 1000-1500 nm, limited by melting at low field strengths and experimental constraints at high field strengths.

Improvements could include accounting for non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann effects, limitations of pairwise dipolar interactions, and local variations in ion concentration.

3. BeppoSAX observed Aql X-1 during the decay of an outburst in 1997, following it from a luminosity of 10^36 erg/s down to quiescence at 10^33 erg/s.
4. The outburst decay showed an abrupt steepening and spectral hardening, suggesting a transition deep in the neutron star's gravitational well, likely to a propeller regime.
5. From the luminosities at the onset of the propeller regime and when kHz QPOs were detected earlier, the neutron star's magnetic field is estimated at 10^8-10^9 G.
6. In quiescence, the X-ray luminosity is lower than that expected from magnetospheric accretion in the propeller regime. The quiescent spectrum suggests a transition to shock emission from the neutron star's pulsar wind interacting with matter from the companion.
7. The soft quiescent spectral component could come from residual accretion onto the neutron star poles or particles hitting the polar caps, similar to millisecond pulsars.
8. The quiescent luminosity is consistent with an enshrouded radio pulsar mechanism with ~1% efficiency in converting spin-down power to X-rays.

8. If the 66 Hz QPO is assumed to be related to black hole mass, it would imply a high mass, inclination, and spin, but then the accretion process would have to be different from GRS 1915+105.

1. The authors analyze a two-genotype system using the Moran process with possibly asymmetric mutation probabilities and nonlinear fitness functions. They derive the Fokker-Planck equation describing the dynamics in the limit of large population sizes.

2. The stationary probability distribution is determined by the Fokker-Planck equation. Asymmetries in mutation probabilities can shift existing stable points and lead to new stable points. Nonlinear fitness functions can induce multiple stable points in the dynamics.

3. The authors conclude that in real biological systems, multiple metastable equilibria may exist when species interact in a way that implies frequency-dependent nonlinear fitness. Stochastic switching between metastable states can occur even without environmental changes.

4. The Moran process provides theoretical insights into experimental data, though exact descriptions may not always be possible. The authors suggest that nonlinear fitness could be the cause of multiple stable states observed in experiments. They propose extending the analysis to systems with more genotypes and changing interactions.

1. The phase-field method has become popular for simulating microstructure formation during solidification due to its algorithmic simplicity, but some fundamental questions remain open.
2. In the thin-interface limit, currently available two-sided phase-field models cannot in general eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness, such as the temperature jump at the interface.
3. Standard orientation-field models for polycrystalline solidification do not correctly describe the evolution of the orientation field because they do not account for the connectivity of matter and resulting geometrical conservation laws.
4. Including microscopic fluctuations in phase-field equations using the standard Langevin approach leads to ultraviolet divergences and renormalization effects that make quantitative modeling challenging, especially for small length scales.
5. Quantitative phase-field models need to control not only the properties of bulk phases, but also of interfaces. Adjusting model parameters to restore correct bulk properties in the presence of fluctuations may not be sufficient.
6. Using a larger interface thickness and coarser grid reduces the strength of fluctuations and renormalization effects, contrary to the usual goal of using the physical interface thickness.
7. Developing quantitative phase-field models with fluctuations for specific materials remains challenging and requires a better understanding of fluctuation effects on couplings between phase-field variables and discretization effects.
8. The phase-field crystal approach opens up new perspectives for modeling polycrystals that are not discussed in detail here.
9. The dual nature of the phase-field method as both a representation of condensed matter systems and an efficient simulation tool makes its further development an exciting research topic at the frontiers of physics, mathematics, and materials science.

1. The authors develop a new method to determine the fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of FGK stars, which is important for studying the Milky Way and other galaxies. Their method uses Balmer lines for effective temperature, NLTE ionization balance of Fe for surface gravity and metallicity, and restricts Fe lines to minimize 3D effects.

2. Comparing their new NLTE-Opt method to the commonly used LTE-Fe method reveals significant systematic biases in the LTE-Fe parameters that increase at lower metallicities, with differences of 200-400 K in temperature, 0.5-1.5 dex in surface gravity, and 0.1-0.5 dex in metallicity.

3. A reliable effective temperature scale, such as from Balmer lines, is critical to avoid biases. NLTE effects in Fe lines must also be included to eliminate discrepancies between Fe I and Fe II abundances.

1. Weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure has been detected in samples of high redshift QSOs, galaxies, and GRBs. For point sources like QSOs and GRBs, weak lensing manifests as angular correlations with foreground mass, while for galaxies it is detected through coherent shear.
2. Another way to detect weak lensing is using fluxes of standard candles like Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). Brighter SNIa should lie behind mass overdensities, while fainter ones should have mass deficits in their foregrounds.
3. The authors analyze a sample of 50 high-redshift SNIa and find that brighter SNIa preferentially lie behind regions with higher projected number densities of foreground galaxies. This relation has a statistical significance of >99% and is consistent with weak lensing.
4. Galactic dust is considered as an alternative explanation but deemed unlikely based on the lack of correlation between the SNIa brightnesses/foreground galaxy densities and Galactic extinction estimates.
5. Modeling shows that the slope of the SNIa brightness vs. foreground galaxy density relation depends on the total mass along the line of sight and the distribution of that mass, but not on the details of galaxy biasing. Standard mass distribution models have some difficulty reproducing the observed slope.
6. Weak lensing of standard candles provides a clean probe of mass distribution on ~1-10 Mpc scales at z<1, complementary to shear-based lensing studies. Future large, uniform samples of SNIa will enable detailed 3D mass mapping.
7. Weak lensing is unlikely to have significantly biased cosmological parameters derived from the current SNIa sample, as the SNIa do not show a skewed distribution in foreground galaxy density.
8. Combining weak magnification and shear data for future large SNIa samples from SNAP and LSST will allow unprecedented accuracy in studying the mass distribution of the nearby universe.

2. Theoretical studies have investigated the effects of DNA bending, tension, and nonlinear elasticity on the loop formation probability and rate. However, a unifying conceptual framework to explain the variety of experimental results is lacking.

3. The authors performed Brownian dynamics simulations of semiflexible polymers modeled as extensible wormlike chains to study the effects of static and fluctuating tension on the looping time. With static tension, the looping time steeply increases with applied tension, in agreement with simulations and distinct from previous theoretical results.

4. For time-dependent tension, the authors considered a dichotomically fluctuating tension. The looping times are reduced compared to the static case. Importantly, the looping time is minimum at an optimal flipping time of the dichotomic force, a phenomenon called resonant activation.

The properties of polyampholyte brushes, which are polymers with charged monomers anchored to a surface, depend on factors like the fraction and sequence of charged monomers, chain flexibility, and grafting density. The authors study planar brushes of flexible, semiflexible and rodlike diblock polyampholytes using molecular dynamics simulations.

Histograms of equilibrium conformations differ based on chain flexibility. A scaling method is used to theoretically describe the linear dependence of brush thickness on grafting density for flexible chains.

The linear dependence of thickness on grafting density is observed for both polyelectrolyte and polyampholyte brushes, although counterion effects differ.

Stellar evolution models combined with a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation can account for 75-100% of the observed stellar density of the VRC relative to the main sequence, leaving little room for the VRC to be due to an intervening foreground population that could explain LMC microlensing events.

1. The fraction of star-forming galaxies declines with increasing local galaxy density in the low redshift universe, known as the star formation-density relation. Mid-infrared data from ISO and Spitzer have revealed highly obscured, dusty star-forming galaxies previously undetected by optical/UV surveys.
2. This study uses data from WISE and SDSS DR7 to examine the dependence of star formation on cluster mass and location within a cluster for 69 local (z<0.1) galaxy clusters. Cluster membership is determined from SDSS spectroscopic redshifts and star formation rates are determined from WISE 22μm photometry.
3. The fraction of star-forming galaxies and the mean specific star formation rate (SSFR) of cluster galaxies increases with projected distance from the cluster center out to 3 times the virial radius. However, the fraction remains below the field value even at the cluster outskirts, suggesting pre-processing of galaxies in groups/filaments before cluster infall.
4. No significant correlation is found between the cluster-specific star formation rate (total SFR normalized by cluster mass) and cluster mass over the range 10^14 to 5x10^15 M_sun. This indicates that cluster processes which strongly scale with mass, such as ram-pressure stripping and harassment, do not play a dominant role in the evolution of star formation in these clusters.
5. The results suggest that the dominant process for quenching star formation in dense environments must be efficient even in lower-mass groups and filaments. Strangulation, the removal of a galaxy's hot gas halo which cuts off its gas supply, is suggested as a plausible candidate since its effectiveness is less dependent on host mass.
6. In summary, this study of a large, uniform sample of local clusters finds a strong dependence of star formation activity on location within a cluster, but no significant dependence on overall cluster mass. Pre-processing in groups/filaments and strangulation are likely to play key roles in quenching star formation for galaxies in dense environments.

1. The analysis of modern accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments requires good control over the intermediate-energy neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section, in particular the contribution of two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations.
2. This work presents a fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model using the frozen nucleon approximation, which assumes the initial momenta of the two struck nucleons can be neglected for high enough energy and momentum transfer.
3. The main advantage of the frozen approximation is reducing the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 (full calculation) to 1.
4. The relativistic model of electroweak meson-exchange current (MEC) operators developed in previous work is used to investigate the validity of the frozen nucleon approximation.
5. The presence of virtual delta excitations requires introducing a ""frozen"" delta-propagator, designed by a convenient average over the Fermi sea.
6. The frozen nucleon approximation is validated by computing the approximate 2p-2h response functions and comparing with the exact results in the relativistic Fermi gas model for the nucleus 12C with Fermi momentum kF = 228 MeV/c.
7. The frozen approximation works notably well in a range of momentum transfer from low to high values, with particularly good agreement for the two transverse responses which dominate the cross section.
8. The frozen approximation enables one to make 2p-2h calculations very efficiently and rapidly, and can be of great interest when implementing 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo event generators.

2. The spin of the black hole plays an important role in shaping the line profile and determining the position of the marginally stable orbit.
3. The widely used laor model assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, while the ky model allows the spin to be a fitted parameter.
4. This paper compares the laor and ky models applied to XMM-Newton data of MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, and to simulated data for the future XEUS mission.
5. The ky model leads to better constrained spin values and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots compared to the laor model.
6. Discrepancies between the models are within uncertainties for current data but become apparent for higher quality simulated XEUS data, with the laor model tending to overestimate spin.
7. Correct re-binning of data with respect to instrumental energy resolution is crucial for obtaining statistically relevant results.

2. The relevant amplitude, the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensors, is separated into its pure tensor and pseudo-tensor parts and decomposed into 8 formfactors expressed by dispersion relations.

3. The subtraction procedure for the formfactors is the natural choice dictated by the high-energy behavior of the imaginary parts, implying that the pure tensor Ward identities are satisfied and the total anomaly is shifted into the pseudo-tensor part.

4. The anomalous Ward identity and trace identity depend only on one finite formfactor, demonstrating independence of a special renormalization procedure. From these, the linearized and covariant Einstein and Weyl anomalies are deduced.

5. The origin of the anomaly is a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of a formfactor, which approaches a delta-function singularity at zero momentum in the zero mass limit, exhibiting the infrared feature of gravitational anomalies.

2. In the ""Mass Varying Neutrinos"" (MaVaNs) model, an unknown scalar field called the ""acceleron"" causes the neutrino mass to vary with the evolution of the universe. The neutrino mass depends on the neutrino number density.

3. In a supersymmetric MaVaNs model, a chiral superfield A is introduced in the dark sector, which couples to the left-handed lepton doublet superfield L and the right-handed neutrino superfield N. The scalar component of A is the acceleron.

4. The scalar potential for the acceleron must satisfy constraints from the observed dark energy density and a stationary condition. The present acceleron mass is assumed to be around 10^-33 eV to avoid significant variations over inter-neutrino spacing.

5. Supersymmetry breaking effects mediated by gravity are considered, with soft terms of the order 10^3-10^4 GeV. Two cases are studied: vanishing mixing and finite mixing between left-handed and sterile neutrinos.

6. In the vanishing mixing case, only the sterile neutrino mass varies on cosmological timescales. The slow variation near the present epoch ensures a positive speed of sound squared in the neutrino-acceleron fluid, allowing it to act as dark energy.

2. From a statistical perspective, stochastic resonance is the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by adding noise. The problem is to estimate a signal transmitted through a channel that has a detection threshold.
3. The authors study the problem of estimation and hypothesis testing for a model where a constant subthreshold signal is perturbed by adding noise from a diffusion process. They propose two observation schemes: observing the proportion of time the perturbed signal spends above the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.
4. For both observation schemes, the authors prove asymptotic properties of estimators and provide an example where stochastic resonance emerges. They also solve the problem of testing a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative using the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion.
5. The authors show that for a particular example using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as noise, stochastic resonance is evident in both observation schemes. For a fixed signal level, there exists an optimal noise level that maximizes the Fisher information.

2. The fourfold oscillation can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the quasiparticle energy spectrum. As temperature increases, thermal activation of quasiparticles at different orientations from the gap nodes reduces the sensitivity to the gap symmetry.

Numerical calculations using a model incorporating Andreev scattering, a dx2-y2 gap, and the two-dimensional Boltzmann transport equation for thermal conductivity reproduce the experimental results well in the whole temperature range up to Tc, confirming the predominance of dx2-y2 pairing symmetry.

3. As alpha increases, the bino mass and scalar masses increase, especially those with large hypercharge. The mass ordering M1 > mu > M2 occurs in HCAMSB, in contrast to M1 < M2 < mu in MAMSB. This leads to differences in the neutralino and chargino composition between the two models.

1. The authors present an analysis of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) based on data from their redshift survey of the Corona Borealis Supercluster. Their local LF agrees well with the Las Campanas Redshift Survey but has a higher normalization than the Stromlo/APM survey, possibly due to photometric errors in the APM catalog.

2. The authors observe evolution of the field galaxy LF within their sample, confirming results from previous redshift surveys. The evolution is limited to the population of blue, star-forming galaxies which becomes more luminous with increasing redshift. The authors do not find evidence for short-term bursts of star formation.

3. The LFs of the two superclusters studied (Corona Borealis and Abell 2069) show differences from the field galaxy LF, likely due to environmental influences. The superclusters have an excess of very bright galaxies and the Corona Borealis supercluster has a brighter characteristic magnitude than the field.

4. There is suggestive evidence for a sharp upturn in the supercluster LF for faint galaxies, which appears more dramatic than the hint of an upturn seen in the local field galaxy LF, though more data are needed to quantify this difference.

5. The authors conclude that a consistent picture of the evolution of the galaxy LF is emerging from various redshift surveys. The overall similarity of the supercluster and field LFs suggests that fundamental galaxy formation and evolution processes do not depend strongly on environment, but the observed differences reflect the influence of environment.

1. Rapidity gaps have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron, and are attributed to color singlet exchange between partons.
2. The two-gluon exchange model predicts the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps, but leads to infrared divergences indicating the need for non-perturbative information.
3. Unitarization of the single gluon exchange amplitude is performed, showing that the two-gluon exchange approximation violates partial wave unitarity.
4. The unitarized amplitude preserves the perturbative QCD description of hard dijet events, but strongly affects the color singlet exchange fraction.
5. The color singlet exchange fraction depends strongly on the regularization procedure, parameterizing non-perturbative effects, preventing quantitative predictions.
6. Despite limitations, the unitarized gluon exchange amplitudes exhibit a universal phase absorbing non-perturbative effects for all partonic subprocesses and regularization parameters.
7. A unified phenomenological description of rapidity gap data is suggested via the gap survival probability and the universal phase.
8. More precise experimental data on the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of rapidity gap fractions are needed to distinguish between different models and parameterizations.

1. Numerous techniques for forecasting electric energy consumption have been proposed, which can benefit power system operators, consumers, and system security. Factors influencing energy consumption include historical load, weather variables, population, and GDP per capita.

2. Previous forecasting approaches can be grouped into time series approaches, functional based approaches, and soft computing based approaches like artificial neural networks (ANN). Existing ANN models have limitations such as being specific to certain geographic areas or only forecasting for a few hours.

3. This study uses historical data from 1994-2013 in Gaza to develop an ANN model for forecasting electric energy consumption. The ANN is trained on a subset of the data in a supervised manner by adjusting weights to minimize error. The trained model is then tested on new unseen data.

4. The accuracy of the ANN forecasting model is evaluated using error criteria like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). 2-fold and k-fold cross validation techniques are used.

5. The proposed ANN model is able to forecast electric energy consumption for Gaza in 2012 and 2013 with good accuracy based on the error criteria. This is the first such model for Gaza in the existing literature. Future work will consider other forecasting techniques.

1. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB and Z-source with an X-ray luminosity of ~10^38 erg/s, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
2. The orbital period of LMCX-2 was previously uncertain, with estimates ranging from 6.4 hours to 12 days.
3. The authors obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy of LMCX-2 over two nights using the VLT and detected an 8-hour period in the radial velocity of the He II λ4686 emission line, which they interpret as the orbital period.
4. The spectra show changes in the strength of the Hβ and He I emission lines between the two nights, possibly due to a precessing, warped accretion disk.
5. Doppler tomography of the He II λ4686 line reveals a bright spot that moves between the two nights, further suggesting a precessing accretion disk.
6. Narrow Bowen fluorescence emission lines are detected, likely originating from the irradiated surface of the donor star.
7. The radial velocity of the Bowen emission (~351 km/s) provides a lower limit on the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the secondary (K_2).
8. Constraints on the mass ratio (q), inclination angle (i), and K-correction factor allow the authors to place limits on the system parameters, but do not tightly constrain the component masses.
9. The data suggest that LMCX-2 likely harbors a neutron star more massive than the canonical 1.4 M_sun.
10. Further long-term spectroscopic monitoring of LMCX-2 could help constrain the system parameters by better determining the spectroscopic and precession periods.

1. The axial anomaly represents a fundamental issue in quantum field theory and has been analyzed deeply over the years through renormalization procedures, path integral formalism, and the study of the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram. The infrared interpretation of the axial anomaly, as proposed by Dolgov and Zakharov, is complementary to the ultraviolet one and sheds light on the physical meaning of the anomalous chiral symmetry breaking.

2. The authors extend the Dolgov and Zakharov approach to study the axial anomaly in the dynamics of physical reactions like the radiative decays of pions and Z bosons. They calculate the decay rates for processes where the outgoing leptons are in definite helicity states and examine the structure of mass singularities and their cancellation. The cancellation mechanisms differ for unpolarized, right-handed, and left-handed outgoing leptons, and the authors discuss the analogies and differences with respect to the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem.

2. They conduct experiments asking humans to explicitly choose the most salient object in a set of images and find moderate agreement between observers.
3. The selected salient objects are shown to attract a significant proportion of human eye fixations, confirming that salient objects guide visual attention.
4. The authors create two new datasets for salient object detection containing complex images with multiple objects and less center bias compared to existing datasets.
5. Analysis of the datasets reveals that salient objects are smaller, more complex, and more spread out compared to objects in simpler existing datasets.
6. The authors propose a simple baseline salient object detection model that first predicts the most salient image region and then segments the object within that region.
7. The proposed model outperforms 8 state-of-the-art salient object detection methods on the new complex datasets, revealing the limitations of current models.
8. Failure cases of the model are analyzed, including incorrectly predicting the most salient object and inaccurately segmenting the object boundaries.

1. Ozsvath and Szabo constructed a decorated topological quantum field theory (TQFT) in 4 dimensions called Heegaard Floer theory, which associates vector spaces to 3-manifolds and maps to 4-dimensional cobordisms between 3-manifolds.

2. The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the cobordism maps when certain homological conditions are satisfied, by decomposing the cobordism into handle additions and representing it by a nice triple Heegaard diagram.

3. In a nice triple Heegaard diagram, all non-punctured elementary domains are bigons, triangles, or rectangles, and holomorphic triangles can be counted combinatorially to compute the cobordism map.

4. For a cobordism consisting of 2-handle additions, it can be represented by a nice triple Heegaard diagram obtained by modifying a Heegaard diagram for the initial 3-manifold and the framed link corresponding to the 2-handles.

5. The modifications involve making the link projection embedded in the Heegaard surface, adding twin gamma curves to the beta curves, stabilizing the diagram for each link component, and performing finger moves to eliminate bad regions.

6. The arguments extend to cobordisms with multiple 2-handle additions by performing the modifications independently on each link component.

7. A cobordism decomposes into 1-handle additions, 2-handle additions, and 3-handle additions, and the cobordism map is a composition of maps associated to each type of handle addition.

8. The maps for 1-handle and 3-handle additions are defined using the H1(Y) action on the Heegaard Floer invariants and duality, while the 2-handle maps are defined by counting holomorphic triangles in a nice triple Heegaard diagram representing the 2-handles.

3. Light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by meson exchange, with the short-range part of the interaction being crucial.
4. The pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges between quarks produce a strong short-range interaction, while their tensor forces largely cancel and the net spin-orbit force is weak in baryons.

6. The short-range part of the chiral interaction is responsible for the correct ordering of positive and negative parity states in the baryon spectra.
7. In the low-energy regime, the nucleon consists of three constituent quarks surrounded by meson clouds, with the short-range chiral interaction playing a crucial role.

2. Pyrazolotriazoles are useful magenta couplers for photographic products but are difficult to synthesize. One preferred route involves preparing triazolothiadiazines and subsequent desulfurization to pyrazolotriazoles.
3. The desulfurization is done in two steps: ring contraction of the triazolothiadiazine by heating in acetic anhydride, followed by hydrolysis of acetyl groups and desulfurization with hydrochloric acid. However, this generates elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities.
4. The improved process uses hypophosphorous acid in the deacylation and desulfurization step, which reduces elemental sulfur and sulfur-containing organic impurities compared to when hypophosphorous acid is not used.
5. Using hypophosphorous acid provides several advantages: it increases product yield, reduces undesirable byproducts, forms H2S byproduct instead of sulfur which is easier to remove, and does not reduce nitro groups commonly present in photographic intermediates.
6. The process involves reacting an acylated triazolothiadiazine with an aqueous mixture of hypophosphorous acid and hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid to produce the pyrazolotriazole product and hydrogen sulfide.

1. The invention relates to mounting blades on the central drive shaft of scraped surface heat exchangers.
2. Blades are typically mounted to the drive shaft using pins welded to the shaft, with the blade having holes that the pins pass through.
3. Installing blades on a vertical scraped surface heat exchanger can be difficult as the blades may fall off the pins if oriented at the wrong angle.
4. The invention provides a blade with locking tracks on both sides that engage with the mounting pins to prevent the blade from falling off.
5. The blade has an L-shaped locking track on each side, with an entry track extending from the hinge edge and an intermediate track extending to the mounting hole.
6. During installation, the blade is slid onto the pins at an angle, then pivoted to a shallower angle and slid longitudinally until the pins engage the mounting holes.
7. The locking tracks prevent the blade from sliding off the pins even if pivoted to the installation angle.
8. The entry tracks on each side are different widths to ensure the blade is installed with the correct orientation.
9. Having locking tracks on both sides of the blade preserves blade rigidity compared to tracks only on one side.

1. The invention relates to detecting and eliminating defective or incorrectly positioned cigarettes in a cigarette magazine of a cigarette production or packaging machine.
2. Transversely positioned cigarettes can block shafts beneath the storage part of the magazine, disrupting production. Manual removal by an operator is laborious and error-prone.
3. The detection process uses an optical checking element to scan an image of cigarettes in the magazine, which is evaluated by image processing to detect deviations from reference images or values and produce an error signal.
4. The elimination process, triggered by the error signal, actuates an ejecting unit to eject a plurality of cigarettes in an assigned ejecting zone, including the defective or incorrectly positioned cigarette.
5. Multiple adjacent ejecting units and zones allow ejecting only a portion of the magazine width. The ejected cigarettes are recycled to recover the tobacco.
6. The ejecting unit has a movable ejector with front and rear walls that align flush with the magazine walls in the through position to allow cigarette flow, and displace to eject cigarettes in the ejecting position.
7. Cameras scan evaluation zones above the ejecting zones and image processing detects defects with a time delay to allow the cigarette to reach the ejecting zone before the unit is actuated.
8. The greatest advantages are achieved by combining the automatic camera-based detection of defective or incorrectly positioned cigarettes with the ejecting unit for their removal.

1. The Social Security Administration (SSA) maintains a restrictive disclosure policy to protect the personal information it collects, even from law enforcement requests, due to the sensitive nature of the data and the agency's pledge of confidentiality.

2. SSA's disclosure policy is more restrictive than the Privacy Act and the policies of most federal agencies, with exceptions being the IRS and Census Bureau whose disclosure requirements are outlined in statute.

3. Some SSA field office staff and local law enforcement are confused by SSA's complex disclosure policy, potentially leading to inconsistent application where information is inappropriately withheld or disclosed.

4. Most law enforcement officials are generally satisfied with the information SSA provides, though many would like SSA to share additional data such as addresses, dates of birth, and employer information to aid investigations.

5. To ensure consistent application of its disclosure policy and assist law enforcement, GAO recommends that SSA take steps to clarify its policy, provide staff training, consider delegating decision-making authority to expert units, and make information on its disclosure policy and procedures readily available to law enforcement.

1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 governs the management of hazardous waste to minimize threats to human health and the environment. It applies to all hazardous waste, including waste from current and past industrial operations and waste associated with cleanups.

2. Three RCRA requirements in particular - land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits - can increase the cost and time of cleanups, lead to cleanup remedies that are too stringent or not stringent enough, and discourage the cleanup of some sites.

3. To avoid triggering RCRA's requirements, property owners may choose to let waste remain in place without treatment, which may pose health or environmental risks. The costs of complying with RCRA can outweigh the economic benefits of cleaning up a site.

4. Since the late 1980s, the EPA has modified RCRA's application to remediation waste through policy statements and regulatory alternatives. However, states have had varied experiences using these alternatives, with some finding them burdensome or overly complicated.

5. In 1996, the EPA proposed new rules to more comprehensively reform RCRA's requirements for remediation waste. However, due to unresolved technical and legal issues, the EPA concluded that comprehensive reform can best be addressed through legislation.

6. The GAO recommends that until comprehensive legislative reform is achieved, the EPA should take steps to ensure regulators have a more consistent understanding of how to apply the EPA's existing policy and regulatory alternatives to RCRA's requirements for managing remediation waste.

2. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) which assumed responsibility for passenger and checked baggage screening operations at commercial airports.

3. TSA has taken actions to enhance screener training, such as adding a dual-function screening course, deploying hands-on training tools, and requiring 3 hours of recurrent training per week, but has faced challenges in providing access to recurrent training due to insufficient staffing and lack of high-speed internet connectivity at some training facilities.

4. TSA lacks clear policies and internal controls for monitoring and documenting the completion of required screener training.

5. TSA has increased covert testing to assess screener performance in detecting threats, but testing has identified that weaknesses and vulnerabilities continue to exist in passenger and checked baggage screening.

6. TSA has implemented the Threat Image Projection (TIP) system at passenger screening checkpoints to test screeners and plans to use the data to measure performance and focus training efforts, but has not yet implemented TIP for checked baggage screening.

7. TSA completed the first annual screener recertification program, but the initial program did not include all components for checked baggage screeners. The second round is underway but still lacks a checked baggage image recognition component.

8. TSA's efforts to enhance screener performance have primarily focused on passenger screening rather than checked baggage screening. TSA conducted a performance improvement study and developed an improvement plan for passenger screening, but has not done so for checked baggage screening.

9. TSA has established performance measures and indexes for passenger and checked baggage screening, but has not yet established performance targets for all components of the measures, which will make it difficult to assess results and focus improvement efforts.

OST has made progress in implementing key trust fund management reforms and plans to complete almost all of them by November 2007.

2. OST's budget and staff have grown significantly since its inception to support its trust reform efforts and expanding responsibilities. However, OST has not provided Congress with a timetable for completing the remaining trust reforms or a date for OST's termination, as required by the 1994 Act.

3. OST has relied extensively on contractors to perform many of its trust reform activities. During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, OST spent nearly 21% of its total appropriated funds on contracts. An Inspector General report found that senior OST officials created an appearance of preferential treatment of one contractor.

4. OST has not developed a workforce plan that reexamines the expenditures and staffing levels needed for trust fund operations once reforms are completed. Opportunities may exist to realign or reduce expenditures and staff as reforms are implemented and accounting functions automated.

5. The average performance award amounts that OST's Senior Executive Service (SES) managers received from fiscal years 2001 to 2005 were generally lower than the average amounts provided to other Interior bureaus and federal agencies.

2. OMB and Treasury have taken steps to help agencies meet DATA Act reporting requirements, such as establishing data standards, issuing guidance, and developing a DATA Act broker system.
3. Many agencies have material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, and other challenges related to financial reporting, financial management, and IT that increase the risk of agencies not being able to report complete, timely, and accurate data under the DATA Act.
4. Agencies have identified reporting challenges that will affect data quality, such as reporting intragovernmental transactions, missing or incorrect ZIP+4 information, and linking financial and award data.
5. The approach agencies will use to assure data quality leverages existing processes, but questions remain about the effectiveness of these assurance processes in preventing or detecting data quality issues.
6. OMB has taken some actions to improve its data governance framework by establishing a Data Standards Committee, but efforts to establish a fully functioning data governance structure are at an early stage.
7. GAO recommends that OMB ensure the Data Standards Committee makes information about its proceedings and outcomes publicly available to promote transparency in data standards development and management.
8. Robust and transparent data quality assurance and data governance frameworks will be essential as agencies begin reporting under the DATA Act to ensure data is useful to Congress, federal managers, and the public.

3. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has been expanding its role in transit-oriented development in recent years through research funding, partnerships, and planning grants.
4. The amount of new transit-oriented development near the six case study transit lines varied widely, attributed to factors like real estate demand, challenges like high construction costs, and local government policies.
5. Key conditions that support transit-oriented development include market demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and transit that efficiently connects to jobs and activity centers.
6. Factors that can hinder transit-oriented development include higher construction costs, reluctant lenders, lengthy local approval processes, unsupportive local populations, and land around stations that is unattractive for development.
7. Local governments can encourage transit-oriented development through zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives, tailored to local preferences and market demand.

The global nature of the problem and the many interdependencies among governments and economic sectors could cause failures to have widespread repercussions.

2. The federal government faces a tremendous challenge in fixing its computer systems in time, as many systems are old, poorly documented, and use a variety of computer languages. Overall progress by the government's 24 major departments and agencies has been slow.

3. Key vulnerabilities that still need to be addressed include establishing governmentwide priorities for fixing systems, developing contingency plans, independently verifying agency progress, and designating responsibility for end-to-end testing of systems. The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion has taken some actions in response to GAO recommendations but more remains to be done.

2. OMB set up a framework for agencies to follow in implementing IQA, but about half of independent agencies did not have IQA information on their websites. Locating IQA information on agency websites was often difficult. From FY 2003 to FY 2004, the number of IQA requests dropped significantly, largely because some agencies like FEMA no longer classified certain requests as IQA requests.

3. The impact of IQA on agencies could not be determined because agencies and OMB do not track the effects of implementing IQA.

1. A survey of the largest sponsors of DB pension plans found that over the last 10 years, 81% modified DB plan formulas, some converted to hybrid plans, and some froze plans. Plans for non-bargaining employees generally decreased in generosity while plans for collective-bargaining employees increased in generosity.

2. 62% of firms reported freezing one or more DB plans. 90% of firms also had 401(k) plans, with most not reducing contribution rates. 67% have implemented or plan to implement automatic enrollment in their 401(k) plans.

3. Health care represented the largest benefit cost at 15% of base pay. All respondents offered health benefits to active employees and some retirees, but 46% no longer offer retiree health to new hires. 54% decreased the firm's share of retiree health costs for non-bargaining future retirees.

4. Most respondents had no plans to change DB benefit formulas, freeze/terminate plans, or convert to hybrid plans before 2012. Recent legislation like the Pension Protection Act and accounting rule changes generally did not significantly influence decisions on benefit offerings.

5. The majority of respondents stated there were no conditions under which they would consider forming a new DB plan. Only 26% would consider it under certain changes like reduced funding volatility.

6. The survey suggests DB plans, even among large sponsors, are facing increasing weaknesses like benefit cuts and freezes. Combined with issues in the broader pension system, it may be time for policymakers to consider alternative models for retirement security.

2. Refugees can benefit their resettlement communities economically and culturally, but can also strain local resources like schools and health systems if the community is not adequately prepared. Formal processes for obtaining input from local stakeholders on refugee placement could help address capacity issues.

3. Federal oversight of the refugee resettlement program focuses on short-term outcomes like employment rather than longer-term integration. Performance measures that incentivize a focus on long-term self-sufficiency and integration could improve refugee outcomes.

4. Secondary migration of refugees to communities other than where they were initially resettled can unexpectedly increase demands on local resources. More timely data on secondary migration could help target federal funding to impacted communities.

2. NFIP does not charge all participants rates that reflect the full risk of flooding. Nearly 25% of policies have subsidized rates, and some properties are ""grandfathered"" to pay lower rates.

3. Increasing premium rates to fully reflect risk could make the program more financially sound and encourage private market participation, but would increase costs for some property owners.

4. Increasing participation in NFIP would expand the risk pool and could reduce premium rates. However, this needs to be implemented carefully to avoid increasing the concentration of high-risk properties.

5. Encouraging private market participation could transfer some risk exposure away from taxpayers. However, this could result in NFIP having a higher percentage of high-risk properties.

2. In 1988, after considering available alternatives, FDIC provided $970 million in open bank assistance to First City to reduce its subsidiary banks and restore its financial health. The recapitalized First City banks embarked on an aggressive growth policy that resulted in high-risk loans and operating losses by 1990.

2. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and attention to regulatory requirements. When DOD uses franchise funds for contracting, responsibilities are shared between the DOD customer, franchise fund, and contractor.

3. GAO found that GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain full competition, ensure fair and reasonable prices, or achieve potential savings for DOD. Price analysis was limited and inconsistent.

4. DOD chose franchise funds based on convenience rather than analysis of best value. Franchise funds' performance measures focus on customer satisfaction and revenue rather than compliance and value.

5. DOD, GovWorks and FedSource paid limited attention to defining desired outcomes and monitoring contractor performance. Oversight methods often lacked performance measures to ensure quality and timeliness.

6. Factors contributing to deficiencies include lack of clear policies from the departments overseeing the franchise funds, unclear roles and responsibilities, and incentives to focus on customer service over compliance and value.

7. DOD needs data to assess whether franchise funds provide better value considering price and fees. DOD customers should share responsibility for clear requirements and oversight.

8. GAO made recommendations to DOD, Interior, Treasury and OMB to improve analysis of contracting alternatives, ensure compliance with regulations, clarify roles and responsibilities, and expand monitoring of franchise funds.

1. Wildland fires play an important ecological role in the United States, but various land use and management practices over the past century have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many ecosystems, leading to dense vegetation accumulations that can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe fires. Changing climate conditions have also increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons. Efforts to reduce wildfire risk involve collaboration between federal, state, local, tribal, and private landowners.

2. The Government Accountability Office examined factors affecting federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildfire risk to communities. They found that federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint planning, leadership, community engagement, and agency resources directly affect collaboration. Community education, fire prevention messaging, and state and local requirements for property owners to reduce risk have an indirect effect. The GAO recommended that the Forest Service and Department of the Interior work with the Wildland Fire Leadership Council to develop measures to assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy.

3. Visa applications declined after 9/11 but have increased from 2004-2006. Several countries have seen large growth in visa demand which is projected to continue.
4. The GAO found shortcomings in how State's visa wait time data is collected, which could mask the severity of delays. State has begun developing a measure of applicant backlog.
5. State has taken measures to increase productivity and address staffing and facility constraints at some posts, but current efforts are generally temporary and insufficient to meet expected demand increases.
6. Despite State's efforts, staffing gaps and facility constraints still contribute to visa wait times at many posts. Planned facility upgrades may not adequately handle future demand growth.
7. Additional security measures since 9/11 have increased consular workload. State has promoted some initiatives to help process legitimate travelers, but more could be done to assist posts and share effective practices.
8. With visa demand projected to increase dramatically, State lacks a long-term strategy to keep interview wait times under 30 days while balancing resources and security.

2. In its first year, TennCare succeeded in expanding coverage to over 400,000 uninsured people while controlling costs. However, the capitation rates paid to managed care organizations were substantially below prior Medicaid costs, leading to financial losses for MCOs and reduced payments to providers. Lack of experience with managed care also led to implementation problems. Serious questions remain about TennCare's long-term viability if large numbers of MCOs and providers withdraw from the program due to financial difficulties.

1. In the mid-1970s, structural changes in the U.S. economy led to the dislocation of thousands of workers from their jobs. Demonstration projects in the 1980s and early 1990s showed the effectiveness of using statistical methods to identify those likely to experience long periods of joblessness.

2. In 1993, Congress enacted the Unemployment Compensation Amendments, requiring states to establish a system of profiling all new UI claimants to identify those likely to exhaust regular compensation and refer them to reemployment services.

3. Most states use statistical models to identify and rank UI claimants by their likelihood to exhaust benefits, while a few states use characteristic screens that do not rank claimants. Many states have not updated their profiling models in many years, risking loss of predictive accuracy over time.

4. Data from 2002-2006 show that about 94% of UI claimants who received a first payment were profiled, 15% on average were referred to services, and 11% on average completed services, with wide variation among states.

5. Six of the seven study states did not offer the in-depth approach to reemployment services prescribed by Labor, such as individual needs assessments and tailored service plans. All seven states cited lack of funding as an issue affecting provision of services.

6. Five methodologically sound studies from the early implementation of worker profiling (1994-1996) generally found the program reduced UI duration, UI benefits paid, and increased earnings, but had mixed results on UI benefit exhaustion and employment rates.

7. Labor's data on worker profiling have reliability issues and are of limited use for evaluation purposes. Neither Labor nor the study states use the data to assess program effectiveness.

8. Findings suggest the worker-profiling initiative is not a high priority at the federal level or in many states. More assertive federal action may be needed to ensure the accuracy of state profiling models and provision of quality reemployment services.

9. GAO recommends that Labor reevaluate its worker-profiling data collection, take a more active role to ensure accuracy of state profiling models, encourage states to provide more in-depth reemployment services or issue updated guidance, and evaluate the program's impact.",0,{'n_points': 10}

1. The military health system provides care to active-duty service members, their dependents, retirees and their families through military treatment facilities (MTFs) and the TRICARE program. In 1998, a 3-year Medicare subvention demonstration began that allowed Medicare-eligible military retirees aged 65+ to enroll in TRICARE Senior Prime, a DOD-run managed care plan. Under the demonstration, DOD could be reimbursed by Medicare for care provided to Senior Prime enrollees, subject to certain payment rules and a level of effort (LOE) requirement.

2. Contrary to initial expectations, DOD's costs for providing care to Senior Prime enrollees in 1999 were much higher than the Medicare capitation rate, primarily due to enrollees' substantially higher utilization of services compared to similar Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. As a result of the payment rules and LOE requirement, Medicare owed DOD no payment for Senior Prime care in 1999. The demonstration underscored the complexities of managing a military Medicare managed care plan and resulted in DOD incurring greater costs for senior care that had to be covered by redirecting funds from other uses.

However, some argue limits would have adverse economic effects or change the distribution of the tax burden.

2. In 2014, 30% of tax filers itemized deductions. Higher-income filers were more likely to itemize and claim larger average deductions. Still, most itemizers (86.8%) had AGI under $200,000 and accounted for 36.4% of total deductions claimed.

3. The types of itemized deductions claimed vary by income. Higher-income filers more frequently claim deductions for charitable gifts, state/local income taxes, and real estate taxes. The mortgage interest deduction is the largest for most filers with AGI under $500,000.

4. Some itemized deductions are tax expenditures. The four largest itemized deduction tax expenditures in FY2018 are estimated to be: state and local income/sales taxes ($74.1 billion), mortgage interest ($72.1 billion), charitable gifts ($58.0 billion), and real estate taxes ($36.9 billion).

5. Arguments for limiting deductions include increasing revenue, making taxes more progressive, simplifying the tax code, and reducing distortions. Arguments against include potentially undesirable economic effects and already high taxes on upper-income filers.

1. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of endangered or threatened species. Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service to ensure their actions do not jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat.

2. In rare cases where a federal action cannot avoid jeopardizing a species, the federal agency, governor of the state where the action would occur, or permit/license applicant may seek an exemption through the Endangered Species Committee (ESC).

3. The exemption process involves multiple steps including a consultation, application, hearings, reports, and a final decision by the ESC. Economic factors may be considered. If granted, the exemption applies to the specific federal action, not the species, and the applicant must fund mitigation measures.

4. Since the ESA was enacted, exemptions have only been sought six times, with just two being granted (Grayrocks Dam and Bureau of Land Management timber sales). Attempts to secure exemptions for the Tellico Dam, Pittston oil refinery, a docking area in Illinois, and a dredging project in Florida were unsuccessful or withdrawn.

5. The consultation process provides many opportunities for federal agencies to modify actions to avoid species jeopardy while still proceeding. The rarity of exemption applications suggests agencies consider ESA consequences early to avoid conflicts and the complex, costly exemption process.

6. ESA protections for species are often one of many issues in resource debates. Even with an exemption, other laws and conflicts may remain. The burden of species conservation may fall more heavily on other areas or resources after an exemption is granted.

7. Controversy persists over ESA restrictions on water supply from federal and state projects in California's Central Valley. While some advocate for exemptions or relaxing restrictions, recent legislative efforts have focused on allowing increased pumping under certain conditions rather than pursuing the ESA exemption process.

1. The tax treatment of capital gains and losses has changed repeatedly over the years, with the current system allowing a $3,000 annual deduction of net capital losses against ordinary income. Proposals have been made to increase this limit.

2. The $3,000 loss limitation was enacted because taxpayers can control the timing of realizing gains and losses to minimize taxes. Increasing the loss limit without addressing the asymmetry between the tax rates on gains and losses would increase the ability to game the system.

3. Evidence suggests capital gains and losses are concentrated among high-income taxpayers, with most lower and middle-income taxpayers unaffected by the loss limit due to holding assets in tax-favored accounts. Increasing the loss limit would primarily benefit a small number of high-income individuals.

4. Increasing the capital loss deduction limit is unlikely to provide effective economic stimulus and could potentially depress stock prices further in the short run. Achieving symmetry between the tax treatment of gains and losses is complicated but could be implemented by requiring $2 of long-term losses to offset $1 of short-term gains or ordinary income, or by providing a tax credit for losses.

1. The official U.S. poverty rate was 14.5% in 2013, down from 15.0% in 2012, marking the first statistically significant drop since 2006. The poverty rate tends to follow the economic cycle, rising during recessions and falling during periods of economic growth. Poverty is more concentrated among certain groups such as minorities, women and children, the elderly, the unemployed, and those with low education levels.

2. The U.S. Census Bureau has developed a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to address weaknesses of the official poverty measure and provide an alternative lens to understand poverty. The SPM has a more comprehensive income definition, a broader family unit, and thresholds based on expenditures on food, clothing, shelter and utilities that are adjusted for geographic differences in housing costs.

3. Under the SPM in 2013, the overall poverty rate was 15.5%, higher than the 14.6% rate under the adjusted official measure. The SPM shows lower poverty among children, but much higher poverty among the elderly compared to the official measure. The SPM helps assess the effects of government programs and policies on poverty, by taking into account in-kind benefits, tax credits, and necessary expenses like child care and medical out-of-pocket costs.

The AoA categorizes domestic support into ""boxes"" based on their potential to distort trade.

2. To determine WTO compliance, policymakers must evaluate if a program fits in the minimally trade-distorting green box, the production-limiting blue box, or is below the 5% de minimis threshold. Amber box policies exceeding the de minimis are subject to a $19.1 billion limit. SCM rules prohibit certain export and import subsidies.

3. In its 2012 WTO notification, the U.S. reported $127.5 billion in green box spending (including domestic food aid and decoupled income support), no blue box spending, $5.3 billion in de minimis exclusions, and $6.9 billion in amber box support subject to the limit.

Funds are awarded directly to institutions, which have discretion in awarding the aid to students.

2. The campus-based aid allocation formula favors long-term participants and may not adequately reflect current student need. Proposals have been made to change the formula to better target funds based on student demographics, financial need, and institutional outcomes.

3. The future of the campus-based programs is a key consideration in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Some argue the programs are duplicative of other federal aid, while proponents say they serve a unique purpose and provide flexibility to institutions.

4. Specific issues being considered include better targeting of FSEOG funds to low-income students, modifying the FWS community service requirements and linking jobs to students' career goals, and options for institutions in the wind-down of the Perkins Loan program.

5. The Perkins Loan program authorization expired in September 2017. Institutions have the option to assign outstanding loans to the Department of Education or continue servicing them. The loss of the program reduces some students' ability to borrow to cover costs.

6. Proposals have been made to extend the Perkins Loan program again or establish a new Federal Direct Perkins Loan program that retains some features of the original program while modifying other terms and conditions.

3. State and local law enforcement agencies cooperate to administer the alert systems, which rapidly disseminate information to other agencies and the public when criteria for activating an alert are met.
4. States have defined the target populations and criteria for activating alerts differently, but most require that the person's whereabouts are unknown and their disappearance poses a credible threat to their health and safety.
5. Alerts are disseminated through various media outlets and communication systems to law enforcement, the public, and other stakeholders to aid in locating the missing individual.
6. Most states have mechanisms to coordinate with neighboring states when a missing person is believed to have crossed state lines.
7. Costs to implement and administer the systems at the state level range from $40,000 to $182,000 annually in states that provided estimates, with some states absorbing costs into existing budgets.
8. Ten states reported activating between 1 to 82 alerts each, with most missing individuals being found alive, though outcomes data is limited.

2. The federal government has built hundreds of water infrastructure projects, but the vast majority of the nation's water infrastructure is owned by non-federal entities. The distributed and diverse nature of ownership complicates assessing and managing risks.
3. Federal agencies like the EPA, Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Homeland Security have taken steps to assess infrastructure vulnerabilities, develop tools and guidance for water systems, and coordinate security efforts.
4. Key issues for drinking water and wastewater utilities include how to pay for security improvements, the adequacy of security safeguards, and the cost and challenges of implementing enhanced monitoring and other protective measures.
5. Congress has conducted oversight on water infrastructure security issues and considered legislation to address policy issues, including government reorganization and additional appropriations for EPA, Reclamation, and the Corps.
6. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 required drinking water systems serving more than 3,300 persons to conduct vulnerability analyses. Legislation encouraging wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments has been considered but not enacted.
7. A key issue has been whether to include water and wastewater utilities in chemical plant security legislation. Currently, water utilities are exempt from DHS chemical facility anti-terrorism standards (CFATS). Proposals to include them have been controversial.
8. Since the temporary authority for CFATS expired in 2009, Congress has been extending the program on a year-to-year basis. Recent legislative proposals have differed on issues like mandating inherently safer technologies and regulating water utilities, but they have preserved the water utility exemption from CFATS.

2. The gross estate includes the value of all property owned by the decedent at death, as well as certain interests transferred prior to death. It is valued at fair market value on the date of death or alternate valuation date.

3. Allowable deductions, such as estate administration expenses, debts, marital deduction, and charitable bequests, reduce the gross estate to the taxable estate. Lifetime taxable gifts are then added before applying the tax rates.

4. Estate tax credits include the unified transfer tax credit ($5,340,000 exemption in 2014), credit for foreign death taxes, and credit for previously taxed property. These provide a dollar-for-dollar offset against estate tax liability.

5. The gift tax liability is based on the fair market value of the gift less exclusions and deductions. The annual per donee exclusion is $14,000, and deductions exist for marital and charitable gifts. Gift-splitting allows married couples to double the annual exclusion.

2. In January 2012, despite the Senate holding periodic pro forma sessions, President Obama made recess appointments of Richard Cordray as CFPB Director and three NLRB members. The appointments occurred between pro forma sessions and have proven controversial.

3. Legal challenges to the appointments would need to overcome justiciability hurdles related to standing and the political question doctrine before a court could reach the merits of the case.

4. The key constitutional question is whether the appointments were made during a ""Recess of the Senate"" under the Recess Appointments Clause. This depends on whether the pro forma sessions are considered meaningful sessions that prevented a recess from occurring.

5. If the pro forma sessions are not considered meaningful, the President likely made the appointments during a 20-day intrasession recess, which is generally considered sufficient. If the sessions are considered meaningful, the appointments occurred during 3-day recesses, and there are questions about whether this is a sufficient length of time.

6. For Richard Cordray's CFPB appointment, there are additional statutory interpretation questions about whether the specific language of the Dodd-Frank Act prevents a recess appointee from exercising certain authorities that a Senate-confirmed Director could exercise.

1. Gross job loss, which is the total number of jobs eliminated by contracting firms, is a normal part of a functioning market economy and is typically offset by an even greater number of gross job gains during economic expansions. Net job loss, which occurs when gross job losses exceed gross job gains, is a more serious economic problem.

2. Trade, trade deficits, offshore outsourcing, overseas investment, and economic restructuring can all cause gross job losses but do not typically result in net job losses according to economic theory and historical evidence. Only economic downturns have consistently caused net job losses in the post-war period.

3. Policies that impede gross job losses, such as regulatory restrictions on dismissals and layoffs, can have the unintended consequence of making firms reluctant to hire new workers, thereby reducing gross job gains. Cross-country comparisons suggest that countries with greater barriers to job loss tend to have higher unemployment rates.

4. The government can help mitigate the risks and costs associated with job loss for workers through policies such as unemployment insurance, which addresses market failures in the private insurance market. Other policies that serve an insurance function include disability insurance, trade adjustment assistance, COBRA health insurance, and income redistribution.

5. Policymakers face the challenge of striking the right balance between protecting workers from the risks of job loss and maintaining the dynamism and efficiency of labor markets. While some policies like unemployment insurance can improve efficiency, overly restrictive policies can impede the reallocation of labor to its most productive uses.

6. In the long run, net job creation is determined by factors such as population growth, demographics, social norms, and policies affecting labor force participation. Policies should aim to facilitate the transition of workers into new employment rather than preventing gross job losses, which are an inevitable part of a dynamic market economy.

4. The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMP concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.
5. The findings support the idea of CVVH as a therapeutic intervention in acute lung injury (ALI) due to clearance of EMPs from patient circulation.
6. Limitations of the model include saturable EMP clearance, differences in relative volumes between the model and clinical conditions, and absence of convection and pressure gradient forces.
7. Frequent changing of the CVVH filter and conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to specialty filters may overcome some limitations and improve EMP clearance.
8. Clinical data support the protective role of CVVH in ALI management, and early CVVH may prevent volume overload commonly observed during resuscitation, particularly in patients with concomitant acute kidney injury.
9. Future steps include assaying patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EMP concentration effects and applying dialysis to rodent models of EMP-induced ALI to examine efficacy and EMP thresholds associated with worse injuries.

1. This study evaluated the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin spray on exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina. The study found that nitroglycerin spray significantly increased time to onset of angina symptoms and moderate angina in a dose-dependent manner compared to placebo.

2. Optimal medical therapy, including anti-anginal medications like nitroglycerin and aggressive risk factor modification, has been shown to be as effective as revascularization procedures in reducing adverse coronary events in patients with stable angina. Despite this, many patients are still referred for revascularization due to a belief it is more effective.

3. The results of this study support the use of sublingual nitroglycerin spray as part of optimal medical therapy for patients with stable angina, including those with persistent symptoms post-revascularization. The prophylactic use of nitroglycerin spray can increase exercise tolerance and potentially improve quality of life in these patients.

2. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a commonly used endodontic biomaterial for root-end filling procedures due to its excellent properties.
3. MTA-Angelus has advantages over ProRoot MTA, such as good sealing ability and marginal adaptation, while containing lower arsenic levels.
4. This in vitro study compared the antifungal properties of ProRoot MTA and MTA-Angelus against C. albicans at different concentrations and time points.
5. The study used a tube-dilution susceptibility test to evaluate the antifungal activity of the materials in both fresh and set states.
6. After 1 hour, both MTA and MTA-Angelus were unable to eliminate C. albicans at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml.
7. However, after 24 and 48 hours, both materials were effective in killing C. albicans at both concentrations and in both fresh and set states.
8. The antifungal activity of MTA-Angelus is likely due to the presence of calcium hydroxide and an increase in pH resulting from the release of hydroxyl ions.
9. The study concludes that MTA-Angelus has an effective antifungal property comparable to ProRoot MTA, although further in vivo studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

2. The reasons for ipsilateral motor deficits are still unclear, but they have been identified in laboratory testing of dexterous motor and coordination function.
3. Possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits include disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal tract, or different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
4. Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have focused on motor rather than sensory deficits.
5. This study investigated the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb and their correlation in 50 stroke patients compared to 40 control subjects.
6. The stroke group showed significantly lower accuracy in a tracking task and higher reposition errors in a joint reposition test compared to the control group, indicating ipsilateral motor and sensory deficits.
7. There was a significant negative correlation between the ipsilateral motor and sensory deficits in stroke patients.
8. The findings suggest that stroke patients have difficulty with complex motor tasks requiring sensorimotor functions due to deficits in both movement accuracy and proprioceptive sense on the ipsilateral side, possibly related to disrupted bilateral hemisphere activation and transcallosal transfer after unilateral brain damage.

3. Sleep variables assessed included trouble sleeping, sleep duration, and sleep apnea. Mental health conditions like PTSD, depression, anxiety, and panic were also evaluated.
4. Incident diabetes was the outcome of interest, self-reported on follow-up surveys. Univariate and multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations were performed to assess associations.
5. Participants who newly self-reported diabetes were more likely at baseline to have trouble sleeping, sleep duration ≤5 hours, sleep apnea, and mental health symptoms. Military characteristics were also associated with diabetes risk.
6. In the final multivariable model, trouble sleeping, sleep apnea, PTSD, and certain military characteristics remained significantly associated with higher odds of incident diabetes, independent of known risk factors.

3. The subjects included 7 boys and 6 girls with a mean age of 3 years 2 months. Most presented with abdominal distension or a palpable mass. The tumors ranged from 1.8 to 20 cm (mean 13 cm).
4. On imaging, 4 patients had multiseptated cystic tumors, 5 had mixed cystic and solid tumors, and 4 had solid tumors. Calcification was rare. Enhancement patterns varied.
5. Histologically, the tumors contained variable amounts of mesenchymal stroma, proliferating bile ducts, and hepatocytes. The amount of hepatocytes differed significantly among the imaging types.
6. Mesenchymal hamartoma has a wide radiological spectrum and can appear totally cystic to totally solid. It rarely contains calcification, unlike other pediatric liver tumors. A solid mesenchymal hamartoma may overlap with a ""mixed hamartoma"" histologically.

1. Adamantinoma of the tibia is a rare, slow-growing primary bone tumor with approximately 300 reported cases in the English literature. The most common site of metastasis is the lungs, while regional lymph node metastases are rare.

2. The authors report 2 cases of tibial adamantinoma that were problematic to diagnose. Case 1 presented with inguinal lymph node metastases initially misdiagnosed as a cutaneous adnexal carcinoma. Case 2 was initially misdiagnosed as fibrous dysplasia before the correct diagnosis was made 9 years later.

3. A literature review of tibial adamantinoma cases with inguinal lymph node metastases is provided. Adamantinoma has been associated with osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia, and some consider it a spectrum of disease that can progress from osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia to adamantinoma.

4. Adamantinoma can be divided into classical and differentiated subtypes based on histology and biological behavior. Classical adamantinoma occurs in an older age group and has a higher risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Differentiated adamantinoma has predominantly osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia-like features and is more benign.

5. Distant metastases are reported in 15-20% of cases, which may be falsely low due to the slow-growing nature of the tumor. Risk factors for metastasis include male sex, persistent pain, short symptom duration, and inadequate initial treatment. Early metastases within 2 years commonly involve regional lymph nodes, while delayed metastases are usually pulmonary or osseous.

6. Surgical excision is the primary treatment for localized adamantinoma and regional lymph node metastases. The authors recommend ultrasound imaging of regional lymph nodes during follow-up. Increased clinical awareness of this rare tumor and its uncommon metastatic patterns is essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal management, along with long-term follow-up due to the slow-growing nature of tibial adamantinoma.

4. The authors grew ZnO nanowhiskers (NWs) with different lengths on CZ silicon solar cells and optimized their density and length for improving solar cell performance.
5. The ZnO NWs were grown by a two-step process: depositing a ZnO seed layer by magnetron sputtering, followed by immersing the samples in a solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine.
6. SEM images showed that the density and length of ZnO NWs increased with growth time, reaching approximately 300 nm after 60 min.

2. Of the 43 different outcome measures used in the stroke SMI studies reviewed, 49% demonstrated some psychometric properties in stroke populations according to the COSMIN checklist, but most measures scored poorly on quality criteria.
3. The review identified limitations in the measures used to evaluate stroke SMIs, including a lack of measures specifically assessing self-management, use of measures without established reliability and validity in stroke populations, and heterogeneity of outcomes assessed.
4. Further research is needed to conceptualize stroke self-management, identify appropriate outcomes for evaluating SMIs, establish the theoretical basis for these interventions, and develop robust outcome measures for stroke self-management.

1. Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by factors such as diet, sedentary lifestyle, and genetics. Adipose tissue secretes pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. High-fat diets in rodents induce inflammation.
2. Menopause, characterized by loss of ovarian function and estrogen, promotes adverse metabolic changes and increases cardiovascular disease risk, especially when combined with obesity. Estrogen has anti-inflammatory effects, but its role is controversial.
3. In this study, rats were divided into groups fed a control or high-fat diet, with or without ovariectomy. Body weight, tissue weights, carcass composition, serum markers, and tissue cytokine levels were measured.
4. The high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy increased body weight gain, food efficiency, carcass lipid content, and serum leptin. The high-fat diet decreased IL-6 and IL-10 in adipose tissues, while ovariectomy had varying effects on cytokine levels in different fat depots.
5. The results suggest that after menopause, women should decrease fat consumption, as the combination of high-fat diet and loss of estrogen may contribute to inflammation and obesity-related complications in the long term.

3. Nearly half of women had never discussed VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP), and only 13% said their HCP initiated the conversation.
4. The most common VVA symptoms were vaginal dryness (55%), dyspareunia (44%), and local irritation (37%), negatively impacting women's lives, especially sexual relationships.
5. Only 40% of women used VVA-specific treatments like over-the-counter (OTC) products or prescription vaginal estrogen therapies, with many dissatisfied due to inadequate symptom relief, inconvenience, or safety concerns.
6. HCPs can foster open communication about VVA by normalizing the conversation, providing a comfortable environment, and using simple screening questions during routine visits.
7. Effective patient education should explain that VVA is a common condition associated with reduced estrogen levels after menopause that worsens over time if left untreated, unlike hot flushes.
8. Women should be counseled on the many treatment options for VVA, including OTC products, vaginal estrogen therapies, and a new non-estrogen oral therapy, ospemifene.

2. Despite campaigns promoting this recommendation, compliance among Danish women has remained low, with only 14-22% of pregnancy planners following the guidelines between 2000-2002.
3. This study analyzed baseline data from 5,383 Danish pregnancy planners in the ""Snart-Gravid"" study to estimate the prevalence of folic acid and multivitamin supplement use and identify predictors of use.
4. Overall, 62.1% of women used either folic acid supplements, multivitamin supplements, or both, while 37.9% did not use any.
5. Factors associated with increased supplement use included higher age, education, income, intercourse frequency, having pap smears, and previous spontaneous abortion.
6. Factors associated with decreased use included smoking, alcohol intake, high BMI, and low physical activity.
7. The prevalence of folic acid or multivitamin use in this study was higher than previous reports, possibly due to increased awareness over time and the prospective study design.

1. Preconceptional carrier screening can identify carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders before pregnancy, allowing couples to make informed reproductive decisions. Carrier screening is offered to the general population, while carrier testing is offered to those with a higher a priori risk.
2. Recently, some companies have begun offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers (DTC). This has raised concerns about the large number of disorders tested, the clinical validity and utility of some tests, and the lack of individualized medical supervision and pre- and post-test counseling.
3. To ensure informed decision-making, it is crucial that individuals receive balanced information about the test's purpose, reliability, limitations, and potential consequences. However, the commercially-driven nature of DTC companies raises doubts about whether their information is adequate for enabling informed choice.
4. The absence of medical supervision for some DTC carrier tests is worrisome, as carrier couples may need intensive counseling about their reproductive choices and risks to family members. Embedding carrier screening within healthcare settings can ensure adequate information provision, informed consent, medical follow-up, and psychosocial counseling.
5. The identification of many carriers through DTC testing may burden the healthcare system with more follow-up visits and costs. Furthermore, DTC companies often emphasize privacy concerns to encourage testing outside the healthcare system and insurance coverage.
6. Preconceptional carrier screening should involve tests that are suitable for important health problems, have known predictive value, and include quality pre- and post-test information and counseling. A commercial DTC model makes it difficult to meet these criteria. Increased regulatory oversight is expected to ensure responsible provision and use of carrier testing services.

2. Reactive Müller cells can aggravate retinal damage in glaucoma by releasing cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). α-Aminoadipic acid (AAA) is a compound that induces glial toxicity.
3. This study aimed to determine if AAA inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
4. AOH was induced in rats by increasing intraocular pressure. AAA or PBS was injected intravitreally. Immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay, and Western blot were performed.
5. AOH induced apoptotic death of RGCs. AAA treatment attenuated TUNEL-positive RGCs and rescued Thy-1-positive RGCs compared to PBS.
6. AOH induced Müller cell gliosis, as indicated by increased GFAP immunoreactivity. AAA markedly reduced GFAP immunoreactivity compared to PBS, indicating attenuation of Müller cell gliosis.
7. Retinal TNF-α protein levels were upregulated in AOH versus control. AAA significantly attenuated TNF-α levels compared to PBS in AOH retinas.
8. The results suggest AAA promoted RGC survival in the AOH model, likely by inhibiting Müller cell gliosis and downregulating TNF-α production.

1. Myosin Va (MyoVa) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along actin filaments. It consists of two motor domains (heads), lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
2. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of individual MyoVa motors and their subdomains by attaching a quantum dot (Qdot) to the motor and measuring its motion.
3. Various MyoVa constructs of different lengths were expressed to isolate the contributions of individual structural domains to the overall flexibility and flexural stiffness of MyoVa.
4. Long exposure times (2.5 s) were used to fully sample the range of tethered Qdot motion and accurately estimate MyoVa's flexural stiffness.
5. The flexural stiffness of MyoVa constructs increased proportionally with the length of the construct, validating the TPM approach.
6. The lever arm flexural stiffness was estimated to be 0.0346 pN/nm, which decreased by 40% in the presence of calcium due to calmodulin dissociation.
7. The distal rod segment was found to have a flexural stiffness of 0.0326 pN/nm, suggesting it consists of coiled-coil segments interspersed with highly compliant disordered segments.
8. The lever arm/rod junction was found to be highly compliant, contributing to the free diffusive search of the unbound leading head and allowing MyoVa to maneuver through actin intersections.
9. The flexural stiffness measurements provide insight into the structural components critical to MyoVa's function, such as rigid lever arms for intramolecular communication and a compliant lever arm/rod junction for navigating the dense actin meshwork.

2. In multivariate analysis, EAC patients with the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) T/G genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival compared to patients with the wild-type T/T genotype. EAC patients with the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) GA/GA genotype had significantly reduced survival compared to the wild-type G/G genotype.

3. The MDM2 T309G polymorphism is known to increase MDM2 expression, leading to inhibition of the p53 pathway. The surprising association of the T/G genotype with improved survival in EAC patients may be due to interaction with TP53 mutation status in tumors.

4. The CDH1 -347 G/GA polymorphism suppresses CDH1 expression and has been associated with familial gastric cancer and sporadic colorectal cancer. Reduced CDH1 expression may enhance esophageal cancer progression by impairing cell-cell adhesion.

3. Surrogate markers of complete healing were generated, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at 2 weeks and end of treatment (EOT).
4. Granulation tissue covering the wound area was also evaluated as a potential surrogate marker.
5. The best predictors were granulation tissue covering >75% of the ulcer area at EOT (79.5% correct classification) and >50% at 2 weeks (73.7% correct classification).
6. Almost 100% of the treatment effect on complete healing was mediated by granulation tissue formation based on proportion-mediated analysis.
7. Treatment with rhEGF significantly influenced healing and granulation tissue development, but its effect on healing was lost when accounting for granulation in the models.

4. Mitofusin-2 (MFN2) is a mitochondrial fusion protein that regulates morphology, distribution, and function of mitochondria, and its mechanism of control is disturbed in obesity and T2D.
5. The study evaluated associations between MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1α genetic polymorphisms and T2D risk in Han Chinese populations.
6. Results showed that the A allele of rs873458 and C allele of rs2878677 in MFN2 gene conferred protection against T2D, and certain haplotypes in MFN2 were associated with T2D risk.
7. No significant associations were found between ESRRA gene variants and T2D or related phenotypes.
8. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis suggested interactions between genetic variants in the MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1α genes in T2D pathogenesis.
9. The study hypothesizes that MFN2, ESRRA, and PGC-1α may serve as partial or additive factors leading to T2D, but the intrinsic mechanism is unknown and requires further functional studies and analyses.
10. Limitations of the study include lack of evaluation of gene-environment interactions and relatively small sample sizes, necessitating replication in additional populations to verify the findings.

2. A recent study suggested paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in clopidogrel bioactivation, with the PON1 QQ192 genotype associated with increased stent thrombosis risk.
3. This study aimed to assess the impact of PON1 Q192R and CYP2C19*2 polymorphisms on clopidogrel platelet inhibition in a mixed-race population using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and VerifyNow (VN) P2Y12 assay.
4. 151 patients on clopidogrel maintenance therapy or receiving a 600 mg loading dose were genotyped for PON1 Q192R and CYP2C19*2 polymorphisms.
5. PON1 QQ192 genotype was not associated with increased platelet aggregation or decreased platelet inhibition during clopidogrel therapy, while carriers of CYP2C19*2 alleles had higher platelet reactivity and lower platelet inhibition.
6. In a multivariate analysis, CYP2C19*2 carrier status, but not PON1 Q192R, was associated with significant differences in ADP-induced platelet aggregation.
7. This study confirms the impact of CYP2C19*2 polymorphism on clopidogrel response but suggests PON1 Q192R polymorphisms are not predictive of platelet inhibition by clopidogrel in coronary artery disease patients.

However, the charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy due to equipment and technical requirements, despite the shorter hospital stay.

2. A study comparing matched pairs of converted laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy patients found that the excess charges were attributed to the laparoscopy itself. Decision tree and sensitivity analyses showed that reducing laparoscopic cholecystectomy charges and conversion rates could make the procedure more cost-effective compared to open cholecystectomy.

1. Partial remission (PR) in type 1 diabetes is characterized by reduced insulin requirements while maintaining optimal glycemic control, and is believed to be due to restoration of residual β-cell mass activity. The study evaluated characteristics and determinants of PR in 242 children aged 0.9-16.4 years.

2. PR occurred in 56.2% of patients, with a mean duration of 9.2 months. Absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and lower A1C levels at diagnosis were associated with higher chances of PR. C-peptide levels were higher in patients entering PR, especially in older children.

3. Early A1C levels at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after diagnosis strongly correlated with PR duration. Patients with 2 positive anti-islet antibodies had shorter PR duration compared to those with only 1 antibody.

4. PR duration or A1C levels 2 years after diagnosis did not correlate with occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetes complications. However, patients with PR lasting 510-570 days had lower A1C levels 3 years after diagnosis, suggesting a short-term effect on metabolic control.

5. The study concludes that factors associated with β-cell mass reserve at diagnosis (A1C, DKA) correlate with PR, and longer PR is associated with better glycemic control up to 18 months after PR ends. Further research is needed to determine long-term effects on complications and hypoglycemia.

The study aimed to evaluate whether objectively measured levels of sedentary behavior and habitual physical activity could predict levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) in overweight/obese adults. Surprisingly, while traditional cardiovascular risk factors were associated with VAT and IHL, no relationship was observed between physical inactivity and liver fat. The inclusion of objectively measured physical activity did not improve the prediction of VAT or IHL beyond traditional risk factors.

2. The findings suggest that while regular structured exercise reduces VAT and IHL, the relationship between general habitual activity, sedentary behavior, and these metabolically detrimental fat depots is unclear. Vigorous intensity activity may be necessary for improvements in progressive forms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The study concludes that objectively quantified physical activity levels and sedentary behavior did not predict those at risk for high VAT or IHL, while traditional risk factors such as waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin may predict the incidence of these conditions.

2. EIA has low sensitivity for detecting C. difficile toxins compared to PCR. Toxin-negative stool specimens that are GDH-positive may give toxin-positive results when isolates from culture are tested.
3. This study compared patient characteristics, diarrhea duration, antibiotic usage, and severity among patients with toxin-positive stool, toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates, and toxin-negative stool and isolates.
4. Out of 127 specimens, 39 were toxin-positive and 29 were toxin-negative by EIA. Among the toxin-negative specimens, 14 had toxin-positive isolates and 15 had toxin-negative isolates.
5. Patients with toxin-negative stool had significantly shorter diarrhea duration compared to those with toxin-positive stool, despite lack of CDAD treatment in most toxin-negative patients.
6. Patients with toxin-negative stool but toxin-positive isolates had milder symptoms and shorter diarrhea duration than those with toxin-positive stool, even with fewer patients receiving treatment.
7. No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of antibiotic usage prior to symptom onset or clinical inflammation at the time of toxin testing.
8. EIA directly measures toxin proteins in stool and likely reflects the patient's actual disease status, despite lower sensitivity compared to PCR which detects the presence of toxigenic bacteria.

2. The primary outcome of this substudy was change in β-cell function over time, assessed using the insulinogenic index (IGI) and proinsulin (PI) concentration.
3. Rosiglitazone significantly increased IGI/IR and decreased PI/C compared to placebo, indicating improved β-cell function, while ramipril had no significant effect on these measures.
4. Rosiglitazone's effect on improving β-cell function was consistent across glucose tolerance subgroups (isolated IFG, isolated IGT, and IFG+IGT).
5. Rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes even after accounting for baseline β-cell function, although this effect was attenuated when accounting for change in β-cell function over time.
6. The mechanisms by which rosiglitazone improves β-cell function may involve reducing insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity, inflammation, and β-cell apoptosis.
7. This study demonstrates that rosiglitazone's diabetes preventive effect may partly be a consequence of improved β-cell function, while ramipril's glucose-lowering effects likely operate through other mechanisms.

3. Cooperation levels were assigned to each strain to quantify the growth benefit they provided to their partner. Strains reaped invested benefits from cooperating, but declined if they cooperated excessively.
4. SMIT interactions identified biosynthetic modules and reflected the topology of the metabolic network, with more distantly connected mutants showing less correlated cooperative behavior.
5. Flux balance analysis models of interacting strain pairs reproduced observed growth patterns, with amino acid biosynthesis mutants modeled better than nucleotide biosynthesis mutants.
6. Shadow prices were used to calculate the cost for a strain to produce a metabolite and the benefit to the partner strain of taking it up. Efficient cooperation involved exchanging low-cost, high-benefit metabolites.
7. Cooperation efficiency terms, derived from stoichiometry alone, correlated with strain growth as predicted by an invested benefits model. Being paired with an efficient cooperator was always beneficial.

7. Machine-learned Bayesian belief networks were used to identify groups of IgG responses associated with PSA decline (clinical response) at 3 months.
8. Different patterns of antigen-specific IgG responses were observed for the different therapies, suggesting different mechanisms of antigen spread or recognition of tissue-derived antigens.
9. The small sample size and limited number of clinical responders made it challenging to develop robust predictive models, but the approach shows promise for identifying relevant biomarkers.
10. Further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to validate the association of specific IgG responses with clinical benefit and to develop predictive models to guide patient selection and monitoring for immunotherapies.

1. Bone mass density and architecture are dependent on mechanical factors, and mechanical stimulation promotes osteogenic cell proliferation and differentiation.
2. This in vivo study explored using the converse piezoelectric effect with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films to mechanically stimulate bone growth.
3. PVDF actuators coated with an acrylic polymer were implanted in osteotomies in sheep femurs and tibias, with static devices as controls. 
4. Actuator devices applied a 5 V square wave at 1 Hz and 3 Hz for 15 minutes each, once every 24 hours.
5. After 30 days, bone samples were analyzed using histology, histomorphometry, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry.
6. Total bone area and immature bone area were significantly higher around actuated films compared to static controls, especially in the areas of higher film displacement.
7. Mineral apposition rate was also significantly elevated around actuators. Osteopontin expression was increased around actuators but TRAP expression was not significantly different.
8. The results suggest piezoelectric materials can stimulate bone growth at the bone-implant interface, but more biocompatible piezoelectric materials should be developed for this application.

1. The study compared serum L-fucose levels between 60 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and 30 healthy controls. OSCC patients had significantly higher mean serum L-fucose levels (10.85 mg/dl) compared to controls (3.47 mg/dl).

2. Serum L-fucose levels progressively increased with advancing stages of OSCC, with the highest levels seen in stage IV cancer. However, no correlation was found between L-fucose levels and age, gender, or histopathological tumor differentiation.

3. L-fucose is a monosaccharide that is a component of glycans and glycolipids. Increased fucosylation of cell surface proteins is associated with malignant transformation, decreased cell adhesion, uncontrolled tumor growth, and metastasis.

4. Tumor cells often overexpress fucosylated glycans on their surface. Increased expression of fucosylated cell surface antigens and upregulation of fucosyltransferases are associated with malignant transformation, increased metastatic potential, and poor prognosis in cancer patients.

5. Elevated serum L-fucose levels are not specific to cancer and can also be seen in other conditions such as cirrhosis, meningitis, tuberculosis, and cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, it is important to exclude other degenerative and proliferative diseases while estimating serum L-fucose levels in oral cancer.

6. Serum L-fucose levels can be used as an easy, noninvasive, cost-effective biochemical indicator for cancer detection, staging, therapeutic success, prognosis, and post-treatment evaluation in conjunction with clinical-diagnostic procedures. Further large-scale studies are needed to establish serum L-fucose as an effective tumor marker in the diagnosis and management of oral cancer.

3. Genes can be annotated based on experimental data for well-characterized genes or based on predicted evolutionary relationships (homology) to infer function.
4. Homology indicates an approximate direction for determining gene function but does not always imply similar function, as evolution has constantly fused and divided genes using a repertoire of domains.
5. Several domain lexicon resources exist to annotate proteins by their domain content and predict molecular function based on the functions of component domains.

The study has some limitations, including reliance on self-reported data, not examining younger individuals, and not controlling for use of other anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies or risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Quality of care for CVD primary prevention falls short of ideal, and further research on clinical decision support and risk calculation reinforcement is needed.

1. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative metabolism, which can regulate cellular signaling through reversible oxidation of protein cysteine residues.
2. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial ROS generation plays a key role in cellular differentiation programs, with higher ROS levels correlating with differentiation of various stem cell types.
3. In the mammalian epidermis, mitochondrial ROS act as pro-differentiation signals and are required for activation of Notch and β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth.
4. Mitochondrial metabolism may also promote cellular differentiation by providing substrates for histone acetyltransferases and demethylases, which regulate gene expression through epigenetic modifications.
5. Understanding the interactions between cellular differentiation programs and metabolism could lead to strategies for controlling cell fate decisions and developing therapies for age-related diseases.

1. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that can be detected in liver biopsy specimens using various techniques such as immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization (ISH), and in situ RT-PCR. However, a reliable histochemical technique for detecting HCV in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tissues is needed for routine diagnostic purposes.

2. The authors established an ISH technique using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe and biotin-free tyramide amplification system (CSAII) for detecting HCV-RNA in FFPE tissue sections of the liver. They tested this technique on humanized liver specimens from HCV-infected chimeric mice and human liver biopsy specimens.

3. The ISH technique using the LNA-modified oligonucleotide probe and CSAII was able to detect HCV-RNA in liver biopsy specimens with a sensitivity comparable to in situ RT-PCR. This method is relatively simple, requires no special equipment, and could become a valuable tool for routine histopathological diagnosis of HCV infection using FFPE liver biopsy specimens.

1. Chemicals can disrupt the thyroid system in vertebrates, which is a concern for wild animals and humans. The OECD and EPA established guidelines using frog metamorphosis to investigate thyroid toxicity.
2. Amphibian tadpoles are particularly susceptible to toxicants in the environment. Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate frog metamorphosis, so changes in tadpole development can reflect endocrine disruption.
3. Many factors influence TH balance, including inhibition of synthesis, increased excretion, and competitive binding to transport proteins. Environmental contaminants can disrupt TH metabolism through these mechanisms.
4. Amphibian metamorphosis has three main stages: premetamorphosis, prometamorphosis, and climax. The amount of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and sensitivity to THs varies by developmental stage.
5. Several hormones interact with THs during metamorphosis, including corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, prolactin, corticosteroids, and sex steroids.
6. Many thyroid disrupting substances have been tested in amphibians, mostly causing delayed or accelerated metamorphosis. However, some studies found no effects of certain chemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations.
7. The amphibian hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis controls TH levels similarly to mammals. The OECD adopted the Amphibian Metamorphosis Assay (AMA) using Xenopus laevis as a test guideline in 2009.
8. The AMA underwent extensive validation, demonstrating its relevance and reliability for detecting thyroid-active chemicals. Endpoints include mortality, developmental stage, hind limb length, body size, and thyroid gland histology.
9. Thyroid gland histopathology is a sensitive indicator of antithyroidal activity but less useful for detecting weak agonistic effects. Experienced toxicologic pathologists familiar with amphibian thyroid histology and physiology are needed to interpret the AMA results.

1. Maslow's hierarchy of needs proposes that human needs can be portrayed in a pyramid, with physiological needs at the bottom, followed by safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization. Safety needs, including personal and financial security, are sometimes more fundamental than physiological needs.

2. Fear and anger are emotions related to safety needs and arise from unexpected stimuli. The amygdala and locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system form a ""safety circuitry"" in the brain that underlies these emotions and ""fight or flight"" behaviors.

3. Appraisal theory proposes that emotions result from people's interpretations of their circumstances. A fast primary appraisal related to fear precedes a slower secondary appraisal related to anger. Emotions flow from fear to anger to happiness or sadness and finally to calmness.

4. Infants and neurotic adults may show more obvious reactions to threats to their safety needs. Phobias may arise from an inability to progress from fear to anger. Depression may involve problems with the secondary appraisal and coping with unsafe situations.

5. The amygdala detects potential threats via a fast subcortical pathway. This is an evolutionary adaptation to recognize dangers and increase chances of survival. The locus coeruleus releases norepinephrine to trigger alertness and projects to the amygdala.

6. In everyday life, an emotional flow of fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and calmness arises as individuals appraise the safety and hedonic value of expected and unexpected stimuli. Safety needs are the most fundamental for humans and relate to mental disorders like anxiety, phobias, depression, and PTSD.

3. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, contributes to TAD boundary strength by regulating nucleosome occupancy.
4. BRG1 knockdown resulted in decreased nucleosome occupancy at CTCF-bound regions and reduced TAD boundary strength, allowing higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.

2. Resovist, an approved MRI contrast agent, is the best performing commercial SPIO for MPI currently, but has drawbacks like a hydrodynamic diameter >50 nm and limited in vivo distribution. The blood half-life of Resovist in MPI may differ from MRI due to fundamental differences in imaging principles.
3. This study evaluated the blood half-life of MPI using magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) for two versions of Resovist - one distributed by Bayer Pharma AG and the other by I'rom Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. The average MPI signal in blood declined to 30% of baseline 5 minutes after injection and was below noise level within 30 minutes for both.
4. The signal decay was significantly faster for Resovist from I'rom Pharmaceutical compared to Bayer Pharma AG. However, the absolute baseline MPI signal strength and signal decay in dilution series showed no significant difference between the two.
5. The rapid MPI signal decay is consistent with the initial elimination phase of Resovist in MRI studies, but no second slower elimination phase was detected with MPS. This difference is explained by the different signal generation principles in MPI and MRI, and the broad size distribution of SPIOs in Resovist.
6. In MPI, only a small fraction of Resovist particles with an ideal iron core diameter of ~30 nm substantially contribute to the signal. These larger clusters are likely cleared more rapidly from blood by the reticuloendothelial system, causing the MPI signal to decrease faster than the actual tracer concentration.

2. Infected Kupffer cells showed a distinct transcriptional response compared to previous in vitro studies, with both quantitative and qualitative differences in gene expression.
3. Uninfected Kupffer cells also underwent significant biological and transcriptional changes, suggesting activation by soluble mediators or signals from infected cells.
4. A gene network centered around retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) was identified that is associated with L. donovani survival in the liver, and perturbation of RXR signaling with agonists or antagonists reduced parasite load.
5. The approach of studying both infected and uninfected cells from the in vivo infection environment revealed host response pathways that would be invisible in in vitro studies.
6. Targeting nuclear receptors like RXR is an active area of drug development, and these findings may provide a foundation for novel leishmaniasis therapies.
7. The study demonstrates the power of examining host-pathogen interactions in vivo to identify biologically relevant pathways that control infection outcomes.

1. The control of appetite involves complex coordination of physiological and environmental inputs. Early theories focused on single factors like glucose, amino acids, or fat tissue, while more recent models emphasize signals from fat tissue and the gastrointestinal tract along with food sensory features.

2. Studies show that acute bouts of exercise do not consistently increase food intake, but as exercise is repeated over days to weeks, a partial compensatory response emerges. Exercise has a dual effect on appetite - increasing fasting hunger levels (which varies between people) while also enhancing meal-related satiety signaling.

3. A new formulation proposes that fat-free mass and resting metabolic rate, which reflects the body's demand for energy, provide a tonic drive for food intake. This drive is tonically inhibited by leptin based on fat stores. Hunger is also episodically suppressed by gastrointestinal peptides released in response to food consumption. The modern obesogenic food environment can undermine this physiological regulatory system.

2. Debonding of denture teeth from denture bases is a major problem, and attempts to increase bond strength include grinding the tooth surface, applying monomer, and creating mechanical retention features.
3. This study evaluated the effect of surface treatments on shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized (Meliodent) and autopolymerized (Futura Gen) denture base resins.
4. The results showed that surface treatment with monomer or airborne particle abrasion significantly improved bond strengths compared to untreated samples, with no significant difference between the two treatments. The bond strength was significantly different between the two denture base resins.
5. Failure mode was predominantly mixed in the Meliodent group and adhesive in the Futura Gen group. The study concluded that surface treatments significantly improve bond strength, but results should be interpreted with caution as factors like mechanical fatigue and thermal cycling were not considered.

3. PCR was used to detect genes for short-chain-length (scl) and medium-chain-length (mcl) polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases in the isolates.
4. 12 isolates had PHA synthase genes, with Pseudomonas strains having mcl-PHA genes and Janthinobacterium strains having both scl-PHA and mcl-PHA genes.
5. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA and PHA synthase gene sequences suggested some PHA genes were obtained by horizontal gene transfer rather than gradual evolution.
6. Bacteria with PHA synthase genes were found in all sampling sites, and canonical correspondence analysis showed a correlation between the presence of scl-PHA genes and low trophy reservoirs.

2. Germination was assumed to occur after 2 or 3 days of suitable soil moisture conditions between May 15 and September 30. Seedling survival required the seminal root to stay ahead of the drying front in the soil.
3. Across the scenarios analyzed, 65-71% of years had successful modeled establishment. The worst 10-year span had a 60% failure rate while the best had only a 10% failure rate.
4. These results show a much higher potential for seeding success compared to a previous estimate of only 10% expected success for the region. However, real-world factors like variable germination response and low seedling survival introduce additional complexity.
5. Total seasonal precipitation was a weak predictor of seeding success. The distribution and timing of rainfall events appears more important than total amount, and future climate change impacts are uncertain.
6. Management implications are that reseeding funds should be available for at least a second year in case of establishment failure, and a diverse species mix may help reduce risk.

2. KLF4-PR1 and MYC-PR2 saRNAs were identified that consistently upregulated KLF4 and c-MYC mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
3. Upregulation of KLF4 and c-MYC by saRNAs was due to transcriptional activation, as shown by increased levels of nascent mRNA, and did not activate the interferon response.
4. Antisense transcripts were not definitively identified as targets of the KLF4-PR1 and MYC-PR2 saRNAs.
5. MSCs treated with KLF4-PR1 and MYC-PR2 saRNAs showed marked differences in cell morphology compared to controls.
6. Microarray analysis revealed that the majority of genes exhibited concordant changes in expression between saRNA treatment and lentiviral overexpression of KLF4 and c-MYC, especially for stem cell- and cell cycle-related genes.
7. Differentially regulated pathways between saRNA and lentiviral samples, such as cytoskeletal remodeling, macropinocytosis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, were likely due to effects of viral transduction rather than off-target effects of saRNAs.

2. Oxygen delivery is determined by cardiac output, hemoglobin level, and oxygenation. Patients with cardiac disease may be at higher risk of impaired oxygenation at lower hemoglobin levels, but studies show they can tolerate moderate anemia if normovolemia is maintained. Signs of inadequate oxygenation that may indicate need for transfusion include hemodynamic instability, high oxygen extraction, and myocardial ischemia.

3. Restrictive transfusion strategies are as effective and possibly superior to liberal strategies. Institutions should establish patient blood management strategies with individual hemoglobin triggers rather than fixed thresholds. Physicians should evaluate each patient for signs of oxygen imbalance, though this may occur at higher hemoglobin levels in cardiac patients compared to healthy patients.

2. Molecular chaperones normally help maintain cellular proteostasis by assisting protein folding and clearing misfolded proteins. However, sustained cellular stress can lead to saturation of these proteostatic networks, resulting in accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates.
3. Misfolded protein aggregates can cause cellular toxicity through various mechanisms like membrane permeabilization, trapping of molecular chaperones, and recruitment of soluble proteins. The aggregates associated with major neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to spread in a prion-like manner.
4. In vitro studies have demonstrated that fibrillar assemblies of misfolded proteins like amyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein and huntingtin can seed the aggregation of their soluble counterparts and spread between cells. The nature of the most toxic species (oligomers vs fibrils) is still debated.
5. Prion protein (PrP) can misfold into distinct conformations or strains that cause different prion diseases. Similarly, evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein and tau may also misfold into distinct strains responsible for different synucleinopathies and tauopathies respectively.
6. Current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are mainly symptomatic. However, the prion-like propagation of misfolded protein aggregates suggests that targeting the spread of these aggregates early in the disease process could be a promising therapeutic strategy.
7. Potential therapeutic approaches include small molecules that interfere with protein aggregation or stimulate clearance mechanisms, immunotherapy targeting misfolded proteins, and designing specific binders that prevent the cellular uptake and seeding of misfolded protein aggregates.

2. Pharmacological experiments suggest that methadone-induced changes in [Ca]cyt and DCD in SH-SY5Y cells are independent of opioid receptors and plasma membrane Ca channels, but are modulated by drugs affecting mitochondrial handling of Ca, such as oligomycin, FCCP, CGP 37157, and cyclosporine A.

4. Women with previous cesarean deliveries only had the lowest prevalence of anal incontinence at 6.4%, suggesting pregnancy itself may not be a major risk factor compared to vaginal delivery.
5. Strengths of the study include the unselected population and assessment of comorbidities. Limitations include the response rate of 45% and reliance on self-reported data. Preventing OASIS may be the most important factor for reducing anal incontinence in women.

1. The incidence of hypotension in non-obstetric patients undergoing spinal anesthesia ranges from 5% to 66% and is thought to occur more frequently in hypertensive patients. This study compared the hemodynamic effects of spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine in hypertensive and normotensive patients.

2. 60 patients (30 hypertensive, 30 normotensive) undergoing elective lower abdominal, lower limb, or perineal surgery under spinal anesthesia were included. Hemodynamic parameters were measured at baseline and at various time points after spinal anesthesia administration.

3. There was no significant difference between the hypertensive and normotensive groups in the incidence of hypotension or bradycardia. However, systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were higher in the hypertensive group at all measurement times due to higher baseline values.

4. The authors conclude that there is no significant difference in the incidence of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension between hypertensive patients with controlled blood pressure and normotensive patients. Lack of measurement of patients' basal sympathetic activity was a significant limitation of the study.

1. The study found that the Dolotest tool is useful for screening patients for pain and its impact on health-related quality of life, as well as for identifying patients meeting criteria for depression. A cut-off score of 65 on the ""low spirits"" domain provided high sensitivity (78%) and specificity (95%) for detecting depression.

2. The study highlights the importance of screening for and treating the coexistence of pain and depression, as patients meeting depression criteria had significantly higher pain scores and reduced quality of life. Treating both conditions together is crucial, as the coexistence is associated with reduced function, work capacity, increased opioid misuse risk, and higher healthcare costs.

1. This study investigated the seroprevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) IgG antibodies among 350 women aged 15-49 years attending a reproductive health clinic in Zaria, Nigeria.
2. The overall seroprevalence of HPV IgG antibodies was 42.9% (150/350 women), indicating a high HPV infection rate in the area.
3. HPV seroprevalence was highest in women aged 45-49 years (50.0%) and those who had their sexual debut at 20-23 years of age (51.1%).
4. HPV infection varied with the women's reproductive characteristics, sexual behavior, and sociodemographic factors, but only reached statistical significance for educational status, tribe, and religion.
5. The high HPV seroprevalence suggests that HPV is circulating with a high prevalence in Kaduna State, Nigeria, and infection with HPV is a major risk factor for developing cervical cancer.
6. The authors recommend introducing a subsidized HPV vaccine in Nigeria's national immunization schedule and improving population-level knowledge about HPV transmission and its link to cervical cancer.

1. Today's world is witnessing rapid innovations in healthcare, with medical knowledge expanding quickly. However, there is a gap between what physicians do in practice and what they should do based on the best scientific evidence. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) aims to address this by integrating the best available evidence with clinical experience and patient preferences.

2. To support EBM, a national evidence-based healthcare system is needed, consisting of three subsystems: a national system of clinical knowledge management to provide the best evidence, a national evidence-based practice system to promote the use of evidence, and an integrated national network of clinical effectiveness. The system should be overseen by the government through the ministry of health.

3. Implementing evidence-based practice requires a systematic approach with micro and macro strategies to facilitate, promote, and guarantee the production and application of clinical knowledge. The government should adopt policies and interventions at both the individual and organizational levels, with cooperation from various stakeholders, to change behavior and support evidence-based healthcare.

1. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus that causes respiratory tract infections, especially in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.
2. HMPV has two main genetic lineages (A and B) and four sublineages (A1, A2, B1, B2), with the A2 sublineage exhibiting the greatest diversity.
3. Synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV was analyzed to understand its evolution, gene expression, and virus-host interaction.
4. All preferred codons in HMPV genomes end with A/U, consistent with the high abundance of A/U nucleotides in the genome, suggesting that nucleotide composition is the main force affecting codon usage bias.
5. Correlation analysis revealed that nucleotide constraint, particularly U3% and GC3%, plays an important role in influencing synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV.
6. Correspondence analysis showed that different HMPV genotypes have distinct codon usage biases, which might reflect differences in their biological effects, such as viral replication and virulence.
7. HMPV exhibits a complementary codon usage pattern compared to its human host cell, which may benefit virus replication and contribute to persistent infection in the human environment.
8. Mutation pressure is the main force shaping synonymous codon usage bias in HMPV, consistent with other RNA viruses, due to their high mutation rates.
9. Phylogenetic differences and host factors also influence codon usage bias in HMPV, providing insights into its molecular evolution and pathogenicity.

2. This study investigated potential disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) status, and nitric oxide production in acutely ill elderly patients with and without delirium.
3. 86 patients admitted to internal medicine and geriatrics wards were included. Delirium was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Blood samples were collected within 48 hours of admission to measure amino acids, dopamine and serotonin metabolites, and BH4 status.
4. Patients with delirium had significantly higher phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratios, lower tryptophan/large neutral amino acids (Trp/LNAAs) ratios, and lower arginine levels compared to those without delirium, suggesting reduced BH4 availability, impaired serotonergic neurotransmission, and increased oxidative stress.
5. No significant differences were found in dopaminergic markers (Phe/LNAAs ratio, Tyr/LNAAs ratio, homovanillic acid levels) between the delirium and non-delirium groups.
6. The findings suggest that decreased BH4 availability, disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission, and increased oxidative stress may play a role in delirium pathogenesis in acutely ill elderly patients.
7. Limitations include the small sample size, potential confounding by cognitive impairment not diagnosed as dementia, and possible fluctuations in biomarker levels and delirium symptoms. Strengths include intensive delirium monitoring and investigating multiple pathophysiological pathways.

1. The American sociologist Valerie Oppenheimer emphasized the role of men's socioeconomic position in demographic change, arguing that men's declining economic prospects, career immaturity, and uncertainty about future income could explain the postponement of marriage. Her ideas contrasted with prevailing theories that women's economic independence or ideational change were driving the retreat from marriage.

2. An analysis of panel data from 13 European countries largely supports Oppenheimer's theory, showing that men's unemployment, low income, temporary jobs, and career instability reduce the chances of entering marriage and increase the chances of cohabitation. However, the effects of men's economic status on union formation are weaker in more gender-egalitarian societies, suggesting that men's role as breadwinner may be less crucial where women also participate actively in the labor force.

1. Osteoporosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is caused by reduced bone strength due to impaired bone mass and quality. Risk factors include immobility, long-term glucocorticoid treatment, vitamin D deficiency, and skeletal muscle atrophy.

2. Immobilization in MS patients leads to a marked imbalance in bone remodeling, with increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. This is mediated by factors such as increased sclerostin levels and osteocyte apoptosis.

3. Glucocorticoid treatment contributes to osteoporosis in MS patients through various mechanisms, including reduced intestinal calcium absorption, increased expression of RANKL, and decreased osteoprotegerin levels.

4. Vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients due to low intake and limited sun exposure. This can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and contribute to bone loss.

5. Inflammatory cytokines and T-cell activation in MS may trigger bone loss via increased RANKL expression. Antidepressant use, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is also associated with lower bone mineral density and increased fracture risk.

6. Management of osteoporosis in MS patients involves assessment of clinical risk factors, bone mineral density testing, and laboratory tests to exclude secondary causes. Non-pharmacological therapies include weight-bearing exercise, adequate nutrition, and fall prevention. Pharmacological options include antiresorptive drugs like bisphosphonates and anabolic agents such as teriparatide, though their efficacy in MS patients requires further study.

2. Studies have confirmed the anatomical safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective, with similar cure rates.
3. This cadaveric study compared the relationship between the tape and urethra in the inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT-scan image analysis after implanting tantalum wire marked mesh slings.
4. The surgical techniques were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions on 10 cadavers, alternating the type of procedure and tape between the right and left sides.
5. Post-capture image analysis was performed using Vitrea Core software, and the relative angulations between the urethral axis and the slope of each MUS tape's mean upward pathway were measured.
6. The results showed that the inside-out MUS tapes angulated around the urethra more acutely than the outside-in tapes (122° vs. 144°, p=0.02).
7. The three-dimensional CT images revealed that the MUS tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior, with the outside-in tapes more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus.
8. The study's limitations include the cadaveric design, which did not allow for correlation with clinical findings, and the small sample size.

1. The Children, Young People and Education Committee held a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 with Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. They discussed the effectiveness of the Act in meeting its objectives, plans for the new post-compulsory education and training (PCET) Bill, and issues around fee and access plans, governance, and quality assurance.

2. The Minister indicated that while some objectives of the 2015 Act are still relevant, the new PCET Bill will aim to strengthen the ability to meet national priorities and create a more collaborative rather than competitive system. She expressed a preference for moving to longer-term, outcome-focused agreements rather than annual fee and access plans. The Bill will also look to introduce a regulatory condition related to good governance.

3. Regarding quality assurance, the Minister stated the intention is to have a coherent, effective and comprehensive regime that is compatible with UK and European standards. While acknowledging concerns about moving to a single quality assurance body, she emphasized the need for greater synergy across different types of tertiary provision. Transnational education will continue to be monitored to protect the sector's reputation.

<summary>
1. The Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 will likely be repealed and replaced by the upcoming post-compulsory education and training (PCET) Bill. The new bill aims to encourage more collaboration across the tertiary education sector.

2. There are concerns that HEFCW's powers of intervention under the 2015 Act are inflexible and difficult to use swiftly when needed. The PCET bill will look to provide a wider range of regulatory powers.

3. Fee and access plans have not been very effective and lack support from the regulator and universities. The new bill may move to a longer-term, outcome-focused approach rather than yearly plans.

4. University governance has been a concern, with a lack of diversity on governing bodies. The PCET bill may introduce a regulatory condition related to good governance. A single quality assurance body for the whole tertiary sector has also been proposed but faces opposition from universities.

1. The remote control should have basic functions like power on/off, volume control, channel selection, and mute. It should be simple with a limited number of buttons since users only use about 10% of buttons on typical remotes.
2. The target users range from kids to adults. It should be easy to use even for those with little technical knowledge. Large buttons would make it more user-friendly, especially for older users.
3. Speech recognition is a potential feature to include, most appealing to the 25-35 age demographic. The voice receiver could be in the TV or the remote itself.
4. A ""find remote"" feature, either by pressing a button on the TV or via voice command, would help locate the remote when lost. This could involve the remote making a beeping sound.
5. Using a rechargeable battery and charging station is a possibility, similar to portable phones. This may be cheaper than replaceable batteries.
6. The remote should include the company color (yellow) and logo, either on the device itself or via backlighting.
7. Advanced features like audio/video settings could be accessed through an on-screen menu to keep the remote simple. The existing channel and volume buttons could be used to navigate the on-screen menus.
8. The industrial designer will work on the component concepts, the UI designer on the user interface, and the marketing person will conduct trend analysis as next steps.

1. The group discussed different formats for representing transcripts and annotations, including an XML format developed by Grad C and the ATLAS format from NIST.
2. They want a format that can handle word-level transcripts, annotations spanning time boundaries, and frame-level acoustic features, while being easy to use and share with others.
3. Grad C's XML format explicitly represents speech concepts like utterances and has a timeline with IDs that annotations can reference. The ATLAS format is more general with nodes and links that applications interpret.
4. For frame-level features, a binary format like ICSI's P-file is more compact than including them directly in the XML. The XML could reference external feature files.
5. Querying the data efficiently is a concern, especially for complex queries spanning the hierarchy. Using a relational database backend or ATLAS API could help, but has a learning curve. Perl scripts on the XML may suffice initially.
6. Next steps are for Grad C to review the latest ATLAS format and tools, and the group to look at alternatives to P-files for features. The goal is picking a representation that enables their near-term work but provides a path to richer tools later if needed.

When asked about the political background and aim of the group in a ""no deal"" Brexit scenario, Huw Morris said that officials have been visiting individual higher education institutions to discuss their preparedness for a no deal scenario. He noted that funding for much activity is secured until December 2020 even under no deal, based on a letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Morris said the Welsh Government has been doing its own research on the impact of Brexit on higher education, further education, and apprenticeship providers.
2. Kirsty Williams emphasized that although the prospect of no deal has risen, they must keep working towards getting a deal and sending a clear message that Wales cannot afford to crash out of the EU without a deal. She said that under a no deal scenario, European regional development and European social fund programs in higher education would continue as ""business as usual"" due to the underwrite guarantee. However, it would mean limited future access to Erasmus and Horizon 2020 programs.

2. The Cabinet Secretary believes that if they can get it right for the most vulnerable learners, they will get it right for all learners. Training teachers on issues like attachment disorder can have a disproportionate benefit for looked-after children.
3. Tracking adopted children is challenging as parents cannot be forced to disclose a child's adopted status, but the government is looking at ways to collect this data while being sensitive to privacy.
4. The latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing and the PDG has not had the desired impact. A cross-government approach is needed to address this.
5. Looked-after children have high rates of exclusion. The PDG alone cannot solve this - getting additional learning needs support right is also crucial.
6. Some Schools Challenge Cymru schools made good progress while others did not, largely due to differences in leadership and the complexity of challenges faced.
7. The government has taken lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru around leadership, systems and processes, teacher quality, and collaboration and applied them to the wider school improvement agenda.
8. Schools Challenge Cymru was always intended to be a time-limited 3-year program. The government provided transition support as it ended to move schools to the regional consortia model.
9. There are differing views on whether the program lost momentum in its final year and how well the transition was managed.
10. The Cabinet Secretary met with staff involved in the program to get their feedback and believes engagement with Professor Ainscow, who led the program, has been sufficient, though this is disputed by the professor.

1. The Schools Challenge Cymru program was a 3-year time-limited program to support school improvement in 39 selected schools in Wales. While some schools made good progress, others did not improve as much, likely due to differences in school leadership, the complexity of challenges faced, and the effectiveness of support advisers.
2. The Welsh government is working to apply lessons learned from Schools Challenge Cymru to the wider school improvement system through the regional consortia. This includes a focus on leadership, tracking student progress, teacher quality, and school-to-school collaboration. However, there are some concerns about whether the same level of intensive, tailored support can be maintained for struggling schools after the end of the program.

1. The group discussed how to handle pragmatic implications of constructions like ""Where is X?"" and whether they should be built into the construction itself or handled separately through construal.
2. They agreed it's best not to try to include all pragmatic readings in the constructions, but some conventional ones like ""Can you pass the salt?"" may need to be included.
3. For the ""Where is X?"" case, they leaned towards handling the directional implication through construal rather than building it into the construction semantics.
4. They discussed using a Bayesian network approach, where mentioning things like ""admission fee"" would increase the probability that the person wants to enter a location.
5. To determine if a construction changes probabilities, they may use a thesaurus to check for related concepts in the dialogue history.
6. Robert will likely focus his thesis on where constructions end and construal begins, so they want to make this explicit in the new formalism.
7. Robert and Nancy will meet Monday morning to work on an intermediate version of the new construction formalism to present to the group Monday at 2pm.
8. They renamed ""simspec"" (simulation specification) to ""semspec"" (semantic specification) in the formalism.
9. They still need to determine how to handle things like emphasis and questions in the semspec.
10. For questions, they discussed treating them similarly to indefinite pronouns from a simulation perspective, since many languages use indefinite pronouns in situ for questions. The question would specify to fill in who/what fills that slot.

1. The meeting discussed updates on the NSF ITR proposal, naming conventions for sound files, and issues with transcribing meeting recordings.
2. The NSF ITR proposal made it past the pre-proposal phase and a full proposal is due in about a month. If awarded, it would fund new research extending the current work.
3. For naming sound files, they agreed to use fixed-length names with fields for meeting ID, speaker, microphone, and channel to make sorting and extracting information easier.
4. PhD C is working on detecting harmonics to distinguish overlapping speech from single speakers. He is exploring different algorithms but having some difficulties and plans to present his results for discussion next week.
5. Postdoc F noted that transcribers sometimes miss short backchannels in dense overlaps. Listening to each channel separately in those regions may help catch them.
6. There was a discussion on whether to keep or remove breaths from the recordings. The group leaned towards keeping them as part of the real data, even if some applications filter them out later.
7. Postdoc F suggested looking into automatically detecting breaths to save transcription time. Professor A proposed just marking the region without precise boundaries and letting models learn the breath sounds.
8. They want to create a master transcript with all the information, then use scripts to extract versions for speech recognition research vs. discourse analysis.
9. As a practical approach, they decided transcribers should mark breaths when transcribing chunks with speech, but don't need to exhaustively mark breaths in non-transcribed regions.

1. The group discussed the prototype remote control design, which included an on-off button, mute button, volume and channel selectors, number buttons, and buttons for teletext and subtitles. They aimed to keep the design simple with large buttons for elderly users.

2. When reviewing the costs, the group realized the current design was too expensive to produce within the 12.50 Euro per unit budget. They discussed ways to reduce costs such as using a flat case design, removing some buttons, and using a scroll wheel instead of number buttons.

3. The group evaluated the design based on criteria such as how fancy and innovative it is, ease of use, functionality, and fit for the target user group. The design scored 41 out of 49 points (84%). They felt the design was innovative but had some concerns about ease of use for the elderly.

4. In discussing the project process, the group felt they should have received cost information earlier in the design phase. They were satisfied with the teamwork and leadership. As next steps, they considered targeting a younger market as well by offering interchangeable covers, and planned to complete a final project questionnaire and presentation.

<summary>
1. Marketing was discontent with the changes made to the buttons during the finance discussion because it significantly altered the design to be less usable and familiar for the elderly target users, in order to reduce costs to meet the budget of 12.50 euros per unit. The new design has fewer buttons and uses a scroll wheel, which may be confusing for older users.

2. Despite the design changes, the team evaluated the final remote control design positively overall, scoring it 41 out of 49 points (84%) based on criteria like fancy design, innovation, functionality, and company recognizability. However, the score for how well it fits the target user group was low. The team considered pivoting to target younger users as well.

<summary>
1. The team discussed the prototype remote control design, which had 17 buttons including on/off, mute, volume, channel, help, number buttons, teletext, and subtitles.
2. To reduce costs to the 12.50 Euro target, they decided to replace many buttons with a scroll wheel, use a flat case design, and possibly remove the LCD screen.
3. The revised design had 5 buttons (on/off, volume, channel, teletext) plus a prominent scroll wheel, which could be used to select channels and access help by pressing corresponding buttons.
4. Marketing was concerned the new design would be too unfamiliar for elderly users and require a lot of explanation, though the team thought the scroll wheel could be made to look like old radio tuning buttons.
5. In the project evaluation, the team felt the design phases were appropriate but pricing information should have been available much earlier before committing to certain design elements.
6. The smart board was found irritating to use for sketching compared to a normal flip chart. Sharing the smart board data also seemed problematic.
7. New ideas for meetings included having each person enter their own ratings into a computer which calculates the average, rather than tallying scores on the smart board.
8. The team believed the revised design would meet the 12.50 Euro cost target, not including the docking station. Changing the front covers could make the design appeal to different age groups.

<summary>
1. The marketing research found that users dislike the look and feel of current remotes, with 75% finding them ugly. Users want a modern, fancy-looking remote and would pay more for it. The remote should be simplified with fewer buttons, and a tracking feature to locate it when lost.

2. The technical design should focus on a user-centered remote, likely just for TVs rather than a complex universal remote. The remote will have core components like a chip, infrared lamp, user interface and power source. Speech recognition is a possibility but may be too complex and expensive to include.

3. For the working design, the team decided on a rounded shape that fits in the hand, with key buttons near the thumb. They will explore a two-part design with a smaller ""zapping"" unit that fits inside the larger remote. The colors will be the company's yellow and grey.

1. The project is named ""Mando"", which means ""control"" in Spanish and sounds masculine in English. The name and look-and-feel will be finalized later.
2. The remote control will be restricted to TV only, with a focus on internet aspects rather than teletext. The company's colors and logo should be clearly identified on the product.
3. A scroll wheel is suggested as a useful way to change channels, especially if paired with an LCD screen to display program information downloaded from the internet. However, an LCD screen would increase costs significantly.
4. Speech recognition is discussed as a potential feature, but there are concerns about background noise interference, support for multiple languages increasing cost, and whether it provides enough benefit to the user experience.
5. The overall goal is to create a fashionable, easy-to-use remote targeted at younger consumers. Minimizing the number of buttons is important for usability.
6. Given the 25 Euro price target, including both an LCD screen and speech recognition is not feasible. The project manager is skeptical about speech recognition being ready for market.
7. For the next meeting, the team needs to work on the component concept, user interface, and trend watching. A decision still needs to be made regarding including an LCD screen and determining if the 25 Euro price target can be increased to include more features.
