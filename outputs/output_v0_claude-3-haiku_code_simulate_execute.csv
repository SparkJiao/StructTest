2. The first `if` statement checks if the bitwise AND of `n` and `n + 1` is 0. This condition is true when the rightmost set bit of `n` is the leftmost set bit. In this case, `10` in binary is `1010`, and `10 + 1 = 11` in binary is `1011`. The bitwise AND of `10` and `11` is `10`, which is not 0, so the condition is false.
3. The function then initializes `pos` to 0, `temp` to `n` (which is 10), and `count` to 0.
4. The function then enters a loop that iterates over the bits of `temp` (which is 10) from right to left.
   - In the first iteration, `temp & 1` is `0`, so `pos` is set to `0`.

3. The function initializes `pos` to 0, `temp` to `n` (which is 15), and `count` to 0.
4. The function then enters a `while` loop that continues until `temp` becomes 0.

99_0,"Let's simulate the execution process of the `decimal_to_binary` function step by step:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which in this case is `8`.
2. The `bin(n)` function is called, which converts the decimal number `8` to its binary representation. This returns the string `""0b1000""`.
3. The `replace(""0b"","""")` method is called to remove the leading `""0b""` from the binary string, leaving us with the binary representation `""1000""`.
4. The function returns the binary string `""1000""`.

Therefore, the final result is:

<ans>
'1000'
