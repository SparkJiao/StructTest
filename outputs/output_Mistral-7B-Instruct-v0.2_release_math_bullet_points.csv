- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
- She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
- She sold half of what was left at the orange house.

**Step 2** Determine the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie sold at the orange house.
- Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially as X.
- She sold a third of X at the green house, so she had 2/3 * X vacuum cleaners left.
- She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, so she had 1/2 * (2/3 * X) vacuum cleaners left after selling to the orange house.

**Step 3** Find the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie sold at the orange house.
- We know that Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the orange house.
- So, 5 = 1/2 * (2/3 * X), which can be solved to find X.

**Step 4** Solve the equation to find the initial number of vacuum cleaners.
- Multiply both sides by 2/3: 5 = 1 * (2/3 * X), which simplifies to 5 = (2/3 * X).
- Multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate X: X = 5 * (3/2).

**Step 5** Calculate the initial number of vacuum cleaners.

1. First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. That's 20% of the total number of students, which is:
   ```
   1. Contemporary dance students = Total students * 0.2
   ```

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance. We subtract the number of contemporary dance students from the total number of students:
   ```
   2. Remaining students = Total students - Contemporary dance students
   ```

3. Now, we need to find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. That's 25% of the remaining students:
   ```
   3. Jazz dance students = Remaining students * 0.25
   ```

4. Finally, we need to find out how many students enrolled in hip-hop dance. That's the number of remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance have been subtracted:
   ```
   4. Hip-hop dance students = Total students - Contemporary dance students - Jazz dance students
   ```

5. We can now calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by dividing the number of hip-hop dance students by the total number of students and multiplying by 100:

- The total amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.
- The total amount of water in the spilled orange drink is 1 liter.
- The total amount of water in the initial volumes is 6.67 + 9 + 1 = 16.67 liters.

**Step 4** Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.
- The total volume of both drinks after spill is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters.
- To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the difference between the total amount of water in the initial volumes and the amount of water spilled.
- The difference is 16.67 - 1 = 15.67 liters.
- The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 24 - 10 (orange drink) - 15 (pineapple drink) + 15.67 (water from both) = 2.67 liters.

**Step 5** Convert the amount of water in liters to deciliters for easier comparison with the initial volumes.
- The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 2.67 liters.
- To convert liters to deciliters, multiply by 10.
- The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 26.7 deciliters.

Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, and she wrote 5 articles on Monday, we can find the number of articles on Tuesday as follows:

```markdown
Articles on Tuesday = Articles on Monday * (1 + 2/5)
Articles on Tuesday = 5 * (1.4)
Articles on Tuesday = 5 * 1.4
Articles on Tuesday = 7
```

### Step 2:
Calculate the total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday and Wednesday.

```markdown
Total articles on Tuesday and Wednesday = Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
Total articles on Tuesday and Wednesday = 7 + 2 * Articles on Tuesday
Total articles on Tuesday and Wednesday = 7 + 2 * 7
Total articles on Tuesday and Wednesday = 7 + 14
Total articles on Tuesday and Wednesday = 21
```

### Step 3:
Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can find the total hours as follows:

```markdown
Total hours on Tuesday and Wednesday = Total articles on Tuesday and Wednesday * Hours per article
Total hours on Tuesday and Wednesday = 21 * 4
Total hours on Tuesday and Wednesday = 84
```

### Step 4:
Calculate the number of articles she wrote on Monday and the total number of hours she spent writing articles on Monday.

```markdown
Total articles on Monday = 5
Total hours on Monday = Total articles on Monday * Hours per article
Total hours on Monday = 5 * 4
Total hours on Monday = 20
```

### Step 5:
Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.

```markdown
Total hours in three days = Total hours on Monday + Total hours on Tuesday and Wednesday
Total hours in three days = 20 + 84
Total hours in three days = 104

First, we need to find the total length of the wires Tracy cut from the 4-feet long piece.

### Step 2:
Each piece of wire is 6 inches long.

### Step 3:
To find the number of pieces, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

### Step 4:
Total length of the wire = 4 feet

### Step 5:
Convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

### Step 6:
Length of each piece = 6 inches

### Step 7:

## Solution to Lloyd's Egg Business

1. Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
2. One dozen eggs equals 12 eggs.
3. Therefore, Lloyd has 252 / 12 = \boxed{21} dozens of eggs per day.
4. He sells each dozen eggs for $2.
5. So, Lloyd makes $2 \* 21 = \boxed{42} dollars per day from egg sales.
6. There are 7 days in a week.
7. Thus, Lloyd makes 42 \* 7 = \boxed{294} dollars per week from egg sales.

- Tom travels for 3 hours from 1 to 4 PM.
- His ship can travel at a rate of 10 miles per hour.
- So, the distance he covers during the outbound journey is 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = **30 miles**.

### Step 2: Determine the total time Tom spends sailing during the entire trip.
- Tom spends 3 hours sailing outbound.
- He also spends some time sailing back.
- We need to find this time to determine the total time spent sailing.

### Step 3: Determine the distance Tom sails during his return journey.
- Tom sails back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.
- Since he covered 30 miles during the outbound journey, the distance he covers during the return journey is also 30 miles.

### Step 4: Determine the time it takes Tom to sail back 30 miles at 6 mph.
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = **5 hours**

### Step 5: Determine the total time Tom spends sailing during the entire trip.
- Time spent sailing outbound = 3 hours
- Time spent sailing back = 5 hours
- Total time spent sailing = 3 hours + 5 hours = **8 hours**

### Step 6: Calculate the time difference between Tom's departure and return.
- Tom sails from 1 to 4 PM during the outbound journey.
- He returns at a time when the total elapsed time since his departure is 8 hours.
- The difference between the hours of his return and departure is 8 hours - 4 hours = **4 hours**.

### Step 7: Convert the time difference to minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The time difference in minutes is 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = **240 minutes**.

52," ### Step 1: Determine the weight of comic books Uriah currently has
- Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound
- Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his bag
- Let x be the number of comic books Uriah currently has
- The weight of comic books is 1/4 * x pounds

### Step 2: Set up an equation to find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove
- The weight of toys Uriah currently has is the total weight of his bag minus the weight of comic books
- Let y be the number of toys Uriah currently has
- The weight of toys is 1/2 * y pounds
- The total weight of Uriah's bag is 15 + (1/4 * x) + (1/2 * y) pounds
- Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds, so the equation to find y is: 15 = 1/2 * y - (1/4 * x)

### Step 3: Solve for y
- To solve for y, we can first get all the terms on one side of the equation
- 15 = 1/2 * y - (1/4 * x)
- 15 = 1/2 * y - x/4
- Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 30 = y - x/2
- To find y, we need to know the value of x (the number of comic books Uriah currently has)

### Step 4: Find the number of comic books Uriah needs to remove to reach 15 pounds
- Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds of comic books
- Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound
- So, the number of comic books Uriah needs to remove is 15 * 4 = 60

### Step 5: Find the number of toys Uriah currently has
- Uriah currently has x comic books
- After removing 60 comic books, he will have (x - 60) comic books
- Let's find the weight of the remaining comic books: (1/4 * (x - 60)) pounds
- The total weight of Uriah's bag is 15 + (1/4 * (x - 60)) + (1/2 * y) pounds
- We know that 15 = 1/2 * y - (1/4 * x), so we can substitute (x - 60) for x in the equation
- 15 = 1/2 * y - (1/4 * (x - 60))

### Step 6: Solve for y with the new value of x
- 15 = 1/2 * y - (1/4 * (x - 60))
- 15 = 1/2 * y - (1/4 * x) + (1/4 * 60)
- 15 = 1/2 * y - x/4 + 15/4
- Adding 15/4 to both sides: 30 = 1/2 * y - x/4
- Multiplying both sides by 2: 60 = y - x
- Subtracting x from both sides: 59 = y
- So, Uriah currently has 59 toys

### Step 7: Find the number of toys Uriah needs to remove
- Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag
- The weight of toys is 1/2 * y pounds
- So, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is (15 * 2) / 1/2 = 30

### Final result
Uriah needs to remove 30 toys to reach the desired weight of his bag.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints2MathFormat'}

Jean initially has 30 lollipops.

### Step 2:
Jean eats 2 lollipops, leaving him with 28 lollipops.

### Step 3:
Each bag can hold 2 lollipops.

### Step 4:
To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops each bag can hold.

### Step 5:
So, the calculation is: Number of bags = Total remaining lollipops / Lollipops per bag

### Step 6:
Plugging in the values, we get: Number of bags = 28 / 2

### Step 7:
The division results in 14, which means Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

### Step 8:
However, since Jean can only fill complete bags, we need to check if there are any leftover lollipops.

- The weight of the truck and its driver is 3755 pounds.

**Step 2** Calculate the weight of the boxes when a full load is reached.
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.

**Step 3** Find the weight of a full load of boxes.
- A full load is reached when the weight of the boxes equals the bridge's weight limit (5000 pounds).
- Weight of a full load = 5000 pounds

**Step 4** Subtract the weight of the truck and its load when empty from the weight of a full load to find the maximum weight of the load.
- Maximum weight of the load = Weight of a full load - Weight of the truck and its load when empty
- Maximum weight of the load = 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

**Step 5** Divide the maximum weight of the load by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.
- Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight of the load / Weight of each box
- Maximum number of boxes = 1245 pounds / 15 pounds = 83 boxes

- Luke builds a 4-leveled sandcastle.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.
- The top level has a square footage of 16.

### Step 2: Determine the square footage of each level
1. The top level (Level 1) has a square footage of 16.
2. To find the square footage of Level 2, we need to find half of Level 1's square footage: 16 / 2 = 8.
3. To find the square footage of Level 3, we need to find half of Level 2's square footage: 8 / 2 = 4.
4. To find the square footage of Level 4, we need to find half of Level 3's square footage: 4 / 2 = 2.

### Step 3: Calculate the average square footage of a level
- The average square footage of a level is the total square footage of all levels divided by the number of levels.
- The total square footage of all levels is the sum of the square footage of each level: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.
- The number of levels is 4.
- Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels = 30 / 4 = 7.5.

- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs to buy 18 / 2 = 9 packages of 2 flowers

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the cheaper price
- The cost of 1 package of 2 flowers is $1
- The cost of 9 packages is 9 * $1 = $9

### Step 6: Determine how many packages of the more expensive price Vincent would need to buy to get 18 flowers
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need to buy 18 / 3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers

<step-3>. The boy then took 6 liters of water.

<step-4>. So, the total amount of water consumed by both girls and the boy is 1/3 * 24 + 6 = 10 liters.

<step-6>. However, the question asks for the amount of water left, not the amount of water consumed. So, the final answer should be the remaining water after the girls and the boy took their shares.

<step-7>. Therefore, the amount of water left is 24 liters - (1/3 * 24) - 6 = 24 liters - (8 liters + 6 liters) = 2 liters.

**Step 2: Determine Gerald's new running time after improving his diet**
- Gerald's running time improved by 10%.
- Let's calculate his new running time: T * (1 - 0.1)

**Step 3: Find the relationship between Lee's and Gerald's running times**
- The difference between their running times was initially 2 seconds.
- After Gerald improved his diet, the difference should still be 2 seconds.

**Step 4: Solve for Gerald's new running time**
- Lee's running time is now 38 seconds.
- Let's denote the difference between their running times as D.
- We know that D = Lee's running time - Gerald's running time.
- We also know that D = 2 seconds.
- So, Gerald's running time is 38 seconds - 2 seconds = 36 seconds.

**Step 5: Check if Gerald's new running time is consistent with his improved speed**
- Gerald's running time improved by 10%.
- His initial running time was T.
- His new running time is 36 seconds.
- Let's check if the difference between their running times is still 2 seconds: |T - (T * 0.9)| = 2

**Step 6: Solve for Gerald's initial running time**
- We know that T - 2 = 38
- Let's solve for T: T = 38 + 2 = 40

**Step 7: Verify that Gerald's new running time is consistent with his improved speed**
- Gerald's initial running time was 40 seconds.
- His new running time is 36 seconds.
- The difference between their running times is 4 seconds.
- Let's check if Gerald's running time improved by 10%: |40 - 36| / 40 = 0.1

- Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.

### Step 2:
- Freda's last batch of tomato sauce was 32 ounces.

### Step 3:
- When canned tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they lose half their volume.

### Step 4:
- To find the original volume of the tomatoes, we need to determine how many ounces one tomato is before cooking. Since one can contains three tomatoes and the sauce is half the volume, we can set up the equation: 3 tomatoes * 16 ounces/can = x ounces/tomato.

### Step 5:
- Solving for x, we get x = 16 ounces/can / 3 tomatoes = 5.33 ounces/tomato (approximately).

### Step 6:
- Now we can calculate the number of tomatoes used by dividing the sauce volume by the volume of one tomato: 32 ounces / 5.33 ounces/tomato = 6.18 tomatoes (approximately).

### Step 7:
- Since we cannot use a fraction of a tomato, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

### Step 8:
- Therefore, Freda used 7 tomatoes to make 32 ounces of tomato sauce.

### Step 9:
- However, since each can contains three tomatoes, Freda must have used two cans of tomatoes to get the required 7 tomatoes.

### Step 10:
- Finally, we can confirm that using two 16 ounce cans of tomatoes results in 32 ounces of sauce, as each can contributes 16 ounces and the loss of volume is accounted for.

**Step 2** Define the relationship between the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

**Step 3** Find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- Brittany's phone can hold `(1800 photographs for Jamal's phone) / 6` photographs.
- Brittany's phone can hold `1800 / 6 = 300` photographs.

**Step 4** Find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph based on the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is `(300 photographs for Brittany) / 50`.
- The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is `300 / 50 = 6` ducks.

**Step 5** Check if the number of ducks calculated in Step 4 is reasonable.
- Since the problem states that Jamal's photograph contains ducks at the zoo, it's likely that there will be more than 6 ducks in the photograph.
- Therefore, the calculation in Step 4 might not be accurate.

**Step 6** Adjust the calculation based on the reasonable assumption that there are more than 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- Let's assume there are `x` ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- The number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is `50x` photographs.
- The number of photographs on Jamal's phone is `6 * 50x = 300x / 6 = 500x / 3` photographs.
- Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we have `500x / 3 = 1800`.

**Step 7** Solve for `x` to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- `500x = 3 * 1800`.
- `500x = 5400`.
- `x = 10.8 * 1000 = 10800 / 50 = 2160`.

**Step 8** Check if the calculated number of ducks is reasonable.
- The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 2160, which is a large number.
- It's possible that there are this many ducks in the photograph, but it's more likely that there are fewer ducks.

**Step 9** Make a reasonable assumption about the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- Let's assume there are `y` ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- The number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is `50y` photographs.
- The number of photographs on Jamal's phone is `6 * 50y = 300y / 6 = 500y / 3` photographs.
- Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we have `500y / 3 = 1800`.

**Step 10** Solve for `y` to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- `500y = 3 * 1800`.
- `500y = 5400`.
- `y = 10.8 * 1000 = 10800 / 50 = 2160`.

**The answer is:** There are approximately 2160 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints9MathFormat'}

## Step 1: Identify the number of queens
Since there are twice as many babies as queens, we can find the number of queens first. Let's denote the number of queens as Q.

## Step 2: Find the number of babies
There are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of babies is 2Q.

## Step 3: Find the number of worker bees
There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is 2 * (2Q) = 4Q.

## Step 4: Check if the total number of bees matches
The total number of bees in the hive is 700. We have Q queens, 2Q babies, and 4Q worker bees. So, 700 = Q + 2Q + 4Q.

## Step 5: Solve the equation
Combining the terms, we get 700 = 7Q. Dividing both sides by 7, we find Q = 100.

## Step 6: Find the number of worker bees
Since there are 4 worker bees for every queen, the number of worker bees is 4 * 100 = 400.

## Step 7: Check if the result is reasonable
Our calculation suggests that there are 100 queens, 200 babies, and 400 worker bees in the hive, for a total of 700 bees. This result seems reasonable, as it satisfies the given condition.

## Step 8: Final check
We have confirmed that our calculation is consistent with the given information and results in a reasonable answer.

## Final result:
There are 400 worker bees in the hive.

First, let's determine how many bees left the hive during the first 6 hours. Debra saw 30 bees leave.

### Step 2:
Next, let's find out how many bees returned during the second 6 hours. She saw 1/2 that number of bees return, so 30 bees * 1/2 = 15 bees returned.

### Step 3:
During the third 6 hours, Debra saw twice as many bees leave the hive as she did during the first 6 hours. So, 30 bees * 2 = 60 bees left.

Time = 5280 feet / 440 feet per minute
Time = 11.95 minutes (rounded up)

<reasoning step>
2 miles = 4048 feet (1 mile = 5280 feet, but for simplicity, we'll use 4048 feet for 2 miles)
Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4048 feet / 264 feet per minute
Time = 15.33 minutes

<step-3>. Determine which person finishes first.
<reasoning step>
Steve takes 11.95 minutes to bike 3 miles, while Tim takes 15.33 minutes to skateboard 2 miles.
Since Steve finishes first, we need to find out how long he waits for Tim.

<step-4>. Calculate the difference between the times.
<reasoning step>
Time difference = Steve's time - Tim's time
Time difference = 11.95 minutes - 15.33 minutes
Time difference = -3.38 minutes (negative means Tim finishes before Steve, but since that's not the case, we'll take the absolute value)

<step-5>. Convert the time difference to minutes.
<reasoning step>
Since the time difference is already in minutes, no conversion is needed.

<step-6>. Multiply the time difference by 60 to get the difference in seconds.

**Step 2** Calculate the income from inflating tricycle tires.
- Each tricycle tire inflation costs 25 cents.
- Three people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
- Since each tricycle has three tires, the total number of tricycle tire inflations is 3 * 3 = 9.

153," ### 1. Let's determine the number of fries left after each animal took their share.

- Dave ate 14 fries.
- Seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so 14 * 0.5 = 7 fries.
- Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 fries.
- Raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, so we need to find out how many fries were left after the pigeons, then calculate 2/3 of that number.

### 2. Calculate the number of fries left after the pigeons.

The number of fries left after the pigeons is the initial number of fries Dave had - the number of fries eaten by Dave, seagull, and pigeons.

- Initial number of fries = 14 (Dave) + 7 (Seagull) + X (remaining)
- We know that 27 fries were eaten by the pigeons, so X = 14 + 7 + 27 = 48

### 3. Calculate the number of fries left after the raccoon.

- The number of fries left after the raccoon is the number of fries left after the pigeons - the number of fries eaten by the raccoon.
- The raccoon ate 2/3 of the remaining fries, so we need to find 2/3 of 48.
- 2/3 of 48 is equal to 32, so the number of fries left after the raccoon is 48 - 32 = 16.

### 4. Calculate the number of fries left after the ants.

- The number of fries left after the ants is the number of fries left after the raccoon - the number of fries carried off by the ants.
- We know that one fry was carried off by the ants, so the number of fries left after the ants is 16 - 1 = 15.

### 5. Determine the initial number of fries based on the number of fries left after the ants.

- We know that 15 fries were left after the ants.
- We also know that 14 fries were eaten by Dave, 7 fries were eaten by the seagull, 27 fries were eaten by the pigeons, and 32 fries were eaten by the raccoon.
- To find the initial number of fries, we need to add up all the eaten fries and subtract that number from the initial number of fries.

### 6. Calculate the total number of fries eaten by all animals.

- The total number of fries eaten by all animals is the number of fries eaten by Dave + the number of fries eaten by the seagull + the number of fries eaten by the pigeons + the number of fries eaten by the raccoon.
- The number of fries eaten by Dave is 14, the number of fries eaten by the seagull is 7, the number of fries eaten by the pigeons is 27, and the number of fries eaten by the raccoon is 32.
- So, the total number of fries eaten by all animals is 14 + 7 + 27 + 32 = 82.

### 7. Determine the initial number of fries based on the number of fries left after the ants.

- The initial number of fries is the total number of fries eaten by all animals plus the number of fries left after the ants.
- The total number of fries eaten by all animals is 82, and the number of fries left after the ants is 15.
- So, the initial number of fries is 82 + 15 = 97.

### 8. Check if the calculated initial number of fries makes sense.

- The calculated initial number of fries (97) seems reasonable, as it is a larger number than the number of fries eaten by all animals (82).

- The cost of both notebooks = Number of notebooks * Cost per notebook
- The cost of notebooks = 2 * $4

**Step 3** Calculate the cost of the bond paper:
- The cost of the bond paper = $20

**Step 4** Add up the cost of all items:
- The total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper

**Step 5** Calculate the total cost:
- The total cost = $X
- X = 4 * $1.5 + 2 * $4 + $20

**Step 6** Simplify the calculation:
- The total cost = $X
- X = $6 + $8 + $20

**Step 7** Add the costs:
- The total cost = $X
- X = $6 + $8 + $20
- X = $30

**Step 8** Check the calculation:
- Raphael bought 4 pens for $6, 2 notebooks for $8, and a ream of bond paper for $20.
- The total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $30

**Step 9** The answer is:
Raphael spent $30 on school supplies.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints9MathFormat'}

Determine the number of eggs Sandra needs for one Spanish flan.
- Sandra requires 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan.

### Step 2:
Calculate the total number of eggs Sandra needs for making 15 Spanish flans.
- For 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 15 * 3 = **45** eggs.

### Step 3:
Determine how many eggs Sandra receives from her neighbor each time she babysits.
- Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs each time she babysits.

### Step 4:
Calculate how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get the required number of eggs.
- Sandra needs **45** eggs, and she gets **9** eggs each time she babysits. So, she needs to babysit **45 / 9 = 5** times with one additional babysitting session to have enough eggs.

### Step 5:
Check if Sandra can make exactly 15 Spanish flans with the eggs from 6 babysitting sessions.
- Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, so she gets 9 * 6 = **54** eggs from 6 sessions.
- However, she only needs 45 eggs for 15 Spanish flans, so she has an extra 9 eggs.

### Step 6:
Since Sandra has an extra 9 eggs, she can make an additional Spanish flan.
- With 6 babysitting sessions, Sandra can make 16 Spanish flans (15 from the required 45 eggs and 1 from the extra 9 eggs).

### Step 7:
Determine how many more Spanish flans Sandra needs to make to reach 15.
- Sandra needs to make an additional 15 - 16 = **-1** Spanish flan. Since this is not possible, she has enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

### Step 8:
Check if Sandra can make exactly 15 Spanish flans with the eggs from 7 babysitting sessions.
- Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, so she gets 9 * 7 = **63** eggs from 7 sessions.
- With 63 eggs, Sandra can make 21 Spanish flans (63 / 3).

### Step 9:
Determine how many more Spanish flans Sandra needs to make to reach 15.
- Sandra needs to make an additional 15 - 21 = **-6** Spanish flans. Since this is not possible, she has more than enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

- First, we need to find out how many gallons they sold to make a profit of $25.
- Let x be the number of gallons sold.
- The profit from selling x gallons is $25.
- The profit per gallon is the sum of the profit from lemons and sugar.
- The profit from lemons is $3 per gallon, and the profit from sugar is $2 per gallon.
- So, the total profit per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
- Therefore, x = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

### Step 2: Determine the number of glasses sold
- They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
- So, they sold 5 gallons * 20 glasses/gallon = 100 glasses.

### Step 3: Determine the revenue from selling glasses
- They sell each glass for $0.50.
- So, the revenue from selling 100 glasses is $100.

### Step 4: Determine the cost of sugar
- The cost of sugar per gallon is $2.
- They used this amount of sugar to make 100 glasses.
- The cost of sugar for 100 glasses is 100 * $2/glass = $200.

### Step 5: Determine the total cost
- The total cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar.
- The cost of sugar is $200.
- The cost of lemons is the total cost - cost of sugar.
- The total cost is $100 (revenue) + $200 (cost of sugar) = $300.
- So, the cost of lemons is $300 - $200 = $100.

- We know that there were 240 participants in total.
- We also know that there were 80 Japanese participants.
- So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160.

### 2. Next, we are given that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team.
- Let's assume there are X girls on the Chinese team.
- So, the total number of Chinese team members is 60 (boys) + X (girls) = 160.

### 3. We can set up an equation to solve for X (the number of girls).
- Let X = the number of girls.
- We know that there are 60 boys and 160 total Chinese team members.
- So, X + 60 = 160.

### 4. Solving for X, we get X = 160 - 60 = 100.
- Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

### 2
Bo has 40 crabs, so:

Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

### 3
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so:

Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10

### 4
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10

1. We know that the winner received 3/4 of the total votes.
2. The total number of students who voted in the class was 80.
3. To find the number of votes the winner received, we can multiply the total number of votes by 3/4.
   ```
   Votes for the winner = Total votes * (3/4)
   ```
4. Next, we need to find the number of votes the loser received.
5. Since the total number of votes is 80, we can subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total votes to find the number of votes the loser received.

First, let's determine the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of red roses `r` and the number of white carnations `c`.

### Step 2:
From the problem statement, we know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations `c`.

### Step 3:
We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of red roses and white carnations: `r = 4c`.

### Step 4:
We also know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations: `200 = 5c`.

### Step 5:
To find the number of white carnations, we can solve the system of equations. First, we'll solve for `c` in terms of `r` from the first equation: `c = r/4`.

### Step 6:
Next, we'll substitute `c = r/4` into the second equation: `200 = 5(r/4)`.

### Step 7:
Solving for `r`, we get: `r = (200 * 4) / 5 = 128 * 2 = 256`.

### Step 8:
Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses she ordered is `4 * 256 = 1024`.

### Step 9:
However, the problem statement mentions that Fred has only delivered some of the order, and Sandra is unhappy with the incomplete delivery. We don't have enough information to determine how many red roses have been delivered, so we can't calculate how many more Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm.

- There are 4 faces with numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6).
- The total number of faces is 6.
- Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
- Probability = 4/6 = 2/3

**Step 2.** Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
- The probability of rolling an even number in a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2.
- Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

**Step 3.** Find the difference between the probabilities.
- Difference = Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
- Difference = (2/3) - (1/4)

**Step 4.** Convert the probabilities to a common denominator.
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 2/3
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/4
- Common denominator = 12
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 8/12 = 2/3
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 3/12 = 1/4

**Step 5.** Calculate the difference as a fraction.
- Difference = (2/3) - (1/4)
- Difference = (2 * 1/4) / (3/1)
- Difference = 2/3 * (4/3) / (3/1)
- Difference = 8/9

**Step 6.** Convert the difference to a percentage.
- Percentage difference = (Difference) / (Sum of probabilities) * 100%
- Sum of probabilities = Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 + Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 2/3 + 1/4 = 8/12 = 2/3
- Percentage difference = (8/9) / (2/3) * 100%
- Percentage difference = 320%

However, the percentage difference is not meaningful as it is greater than 100%. This indicates an error in the calculation. The actual percentage difference should be less than 100%.

**Step 7.** Identify the error in the calculation.
- The error is in the calculation of the percentage difference.
- The percentage difference should be calculated as (Difference) / (Average probability) * 100%.

**Step 8.** Recalculate the percentage difference.
- Average probability = (Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 + Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row) / 2
- Average probability = (2/3 + 1/4) / 2 = 7/12
- Percentage difference = (8/9) / (7/12) * 100%

### 1. Calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year:
- Tom plants 10 trees each year.
- Tom chops down 2 trees each year.

### 2. Determine the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year:
- Subtract the number of trees Tom chops down from the number of trees he plants: 10 (trees planted) - 2 (trees chopped down) = 8 trees per year.

### 3. Calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years of planting and chopping down trees:
- Multiply the number of trees Tom adds each year by the number of years: 8 (trees added per year) * 10 (years) = 80 trees.
- Add the initial number of trees Tom starts with: 80 (trees added) + 50 (initial trees) = 130 trees.

### 4. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years:
- 30% of the trees die after 10 years: 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

### 5. Subtract the number of dead trees from the number of living trees:
- Subtract the number of dead trees from the number of trees Tom has after 10 years: 130 (total trees) - 39 (dead trees) = 91 trees.

### 6. Round down the number of trees to the nearest whole number:
- Since Tom cannot have a fraction of a tree, we round down the number of trees to the nearest whole number: 91 trees.

### 7. Summarize the steps to find the final answer:
- Tom plants 10 trees each year and chops down 2 trees each year.
- After 10 years, he has planted 80 trees and chopped down 20 trees, resulting in a net gain of 60 trees.
- However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years, reducing the number of living trees to 91.

### 8. State the final answer:

- The neighbors placed 18 pink flamingos on Sue's yard on Friday.

**Step 2** - Determine the number of pink flamingos after the first replacement.
- The neighbors took back one third of the pink flamingos and painted them white.
- One third of 18 is 6, so 12 pink flamingos were taken away.
- Therefore, there are 18 - 12 = 6 pink flamingos remaining.

**Step 3** - Identify the number of pink flamingos after the second addition.
- The neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos on Sunday.

**Step 4** - Determine the number of pink flamingos compared to white flamingos.
- Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
- After the first replacement, there were 6 pink flamingos.
- After the second addition, there are now 18 + 6 = 24 pink flamingos.
- The number of white flamingos remains the same as before the first replacement, which is 12.

**Step 5** - Calculate the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos.
- The difference is the number of pink flamingos minus the number of white flamingos.
- The difference is 24 (pink) - 12 (white) = 12.

### Step 1:
First, we need to determine how many pounds of carrots each restaurant will receive. We know that:
- Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots.
- There are 40 restaurants in total.

### Step 2:
Calculate the total pounds of carrots needed for all restaurants:
Total pounds of carrots = Pounds per restaurant * Number of restaurants
Total pounds of carrots = 2 pounds * 40 restaurants
Total pounds of carrots = 80 pounds

### Step 3:
However, we started with 200 pounds of carrots. So, there are some extra pounds that won't be used.

### Step 4:
Find the difference between the total pounds of carrots and the pounds needed for all restaurants:
Extra pounds = Total pounds of carrots - Pounds for all restaurants
Extra pounds = 200 pounds - 80 pounds
Extra pounds = 120 pounds

### Step 5:
The following are the key points of this problem:
- 200 pounds of carrots were distributed.
- Each restaurant received 2 pounds.
- 40 restaurants were served.
- 80 pounds of carrots were used.
- 120 pounds of carrots were not used.

### Step 6:
Here's a summary of the distribution:
- Carrots distributed: 200 pounds
- Carrots used: 80 pounds
- Carrots not used: 120 pounds

### Step 7:
The following are some possible reasons why the extra carrots might not be used:
- Overestimation of demand
- Seasonal surplus
- Storage limitations
- Waste management issues

### Step 8:
It's important to note that the extra carrots could still be useful in various ways, such as:
- Donating to local food banks or schools
- Selling to other restaurants or markets
- Using for other dishes or menu items
- Processing into carrot juice or puree

### Step 9:
In conclusion, even though 120 pounds of carrots were not used in this distribution, they still have value and can be put to good use.

### Step 10:
Final result:

- Add the scores of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 348
- Divide the sum by the number of tests (excluding the lowest score): 348 / 5 = 69.6

**Step 2:** Determine the lowest score Brinley will drop.
- Since Mr. Bert allows students to remove one score, Brinley will drop the lowest score.

**Step 3:** Calculate the total possible average without dropping any score.
- Add the scores of all six tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + X = ____
- Divide the sum by the total number of tests: (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + X) / 6 = 93

**Step 4:** Solve for X, the sixth test score.
- Multiply both sides of the equation by 6: 532 + 6X = 561
- Subtract 532 from both sides: 6X = 29
- Divide both sides by 6: X = 4.8333
- Since scores are integers, round up to the nearest whole number: X = 5

**Step 5:** Check if the calculated score is possible.
- The sixth test score should be higher than the current lowest score (71).
- The calculated score (5) is lower than the current lowest score (71), which is not possible.

**Step 6:** Adjust the target average.
- Since the calculated score is not possible, Brinley needs to aim for a higher average than 93 to account for the lowest score.

**Step 7:** Recalculate the target average.
- Let's aim for an average of 95 instead: (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + X) / 6 = 95

**Step 8:** Solve for X, the sixth test score.
- Multiply both sides of the equation by 6: 532 + 6X = 576
- Subtract 532 from both sides: 6X = 44
- Divide both sides by 6: X = 7.3333
- Since scores are integers, round up to the nearest whole number: X = 8

Next, we can simplify the equation by distributing the 3 and the 5:

3W - 6 + 5W = 42

### Step 6:
Combine like terms:

8W - 6 = 42

### Step 7:
Add 6 to both sides:

8W = 48

212," **Step 1:** Determine the perimeter of the rectangle park.
- The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.
- The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L+W), where L is the length and W is the width.

**Step 2:** Calculate the perimeter of the park.
- Plug in the values for L and W: P = 2(1.5 miles + 6 miles)
- Simplify the expression: P = 2(1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2(7.5 miles) = 15 miles

**Step 3:** Determine how long it takes Gary to walk the perimeter of the park.
- Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles/hour.
- To find the time it takes to walk a certain distance, divide the distance by Gary's walking speed.

**Step 4:** Calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the perimeter of the park.
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Plug in the values: Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour

**Step 5:** Simplify the expression.
- Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

**Step 6:** Check the calculation.
- The perimeter of the park is 15 miles, and Gary walks at 3 miles/hour.
- To cover 15 miles, it would take Gary 5 hours.

- Let's denote the initial volume of the small pool as S (in gallons).
- The initial volume of the big pool is 2S (twice the volume of the small pool).

**Step 2: Determine the time elapsed since the initial state**
- 4 minutes have passed since the initial state.

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of water lost from the big pool**
- The big pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- The amount of water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

**Step 4: Calculate the current volume of the big pool**
- The initial volume of the big pool was 2S.
- The volume of the big pool has decreased by 16 gallons due to the leak.
- The current volume of the big pool is 2S - 16 gallons.

**Step 5: Calculate the amount of water lost from the small pool**
- Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the small pool had S gallons.
- The small pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- The amount of water lost from the small pool in 4 minutes is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

**Step 6: Calculate the current volume of the small pool**
- The initial volume of the small pool was S gallons.
- The volume of the small pool has decreased by 16 gallons due to the leak.
- The current volume of the small pool is S gallons - 16 gallons.

**Step 7: Determine the relationship between the current volumes of the pools**
- The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool.

**Step 8: Solve for the current volume of the small pool**
- Let X be the current volume of the small pool.
- We know that the current volume of the big pool is 4X.
- From Step 4, we have 2S - 16 = 4X.

**Step 9: Solve for S**
- Subtract X from both sides of the equation: 2S = 5X.
- Divide both sides by 2: S = 2.5X.

**Step 10: Substitute S back into the equation for the current volume of the small pool**
- The current volume of the small pool is X = S / 2.5 = (2.5X) / 2.5 = X / 1.
- Solving for X, we get X = 1 gallon.

### Step 1:
First, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt.

- The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
- The cost of the belt is $32.00.
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt.

### Step 2:
Calculate the total cost.

- Total cost = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt)
- Total cost = $352.00

### Step 3:
Determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough money for her purchase.

- Her hourly wage is $8.00.
- She needs to earn $352.00.

### Step 4:
Calculate the number of hours required to earn the necessary amount.

- Hours required = Total cost / Hourly wage
- Hours required = $352.00 / $8.00
- Hours required = 44.00

### Step 5:
Since Lori cannot work half an hour, she needs to work for an additional hour to reach the next hourly mark.

- Additional hours required = 0.5 * Hours required
- Additional hours required = 0.5 * 44.00
- Additional hours required = 22.00

### Step 6:
Calculate the total hours required to make the purchase.

- Total hours required = Hours required + Additional hours required
- Total hours required = 44.00 + 22.00
- Total hours required = 66.00

### Step 7:
Round up the total hours required to the nearest hour since Lori cannot work in half-hour increments.

- Total hours required = ceil(Total hours required)
- Total hours required = ceil(66.00)
- Total hours required = 67.00

### Final result:
Lori will need to work for 67 hours to make her purchase.

- So, John needs 20 friends * 4 slices = <<20*4>>>>

### Step 3:
Determine how many pizzas are needed to provide the required number of slices.
- Each pizza provides 8 slices.
- Divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.
- John needs 24 slices / 8 slices = <<24/8>>>> pizzas.

### Step 4:
Round up the number of pizzas to ensure there are enough slices for all friends.
- Since John cannot order a fraction of a pizza, he needs to round up the number of pizzas.
- Round up the number of pizzas to the nearest whole number.
- John needs ceil(24/8) = <<ceil(24/8)>>>> pizzas.

### Step 5:
Check if the calculated number of pizzas is a reasonable answer.
- The calculated number of pizzas seems reasonable, as it is a whole number.

### Step 6:
Consider potential errors or assumptions in the calculation.
- There are no errors or assumptions in the calculation.

### Step 7:
Verify the calculation with a simple multiplication.
- John needs slices for 20 friends, each getting 4 slices.
- That's 20 friends * 4 slices = <<20*4>>>> slices.
- Each pizza provides 8 slices.
- That's ceil(20 * 4 / 8) = ceil(5) = <<ceil(5)>>>> pizzas.

### Step 8:
Consider any additional factors or constraints.
- There are no additional factors or constraints.

### Step 9:
State the final result.
- John needs to order <<ceil(24/8)>>>> pizzas to ensure each friend can have 4 slices.

### The answer is:
John needs to order 3 pizzas.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

- Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R.
- According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has R + 6 candies.
- Let's denote the number of candies John has as J.

### Step 2:
- The problem states that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so J = 2R.

### Step 3:
- We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation 2R = 54.

### Step 4:
- Solving for R, we find that R = 18 (since 2 * 18 = 36 and 36 / 2 = 18).

### Step 5:
- Now that we know Robert has 18 candies, we can find out how many candies James has: James has R + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 candies.

### Step 6:
- To find the difference in the number of candies between John and James, we can subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: Difference = J - (James' candies).

### Step 7:
- Substituting the values we found for J and James' candies, we get Difference = 54 - 24 = 30.

## Solution

1. Dolly has two books, so she can read a total of two books.
2. Pandora has one book, so she can read a total of one book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books, meaning they each read one additional book.
4. So, Dolly reads a total of three books (her two books and Pandora's book).
5. Similarly, Pandora reads a total of three books (her book and Dolly's two books).
6. Together, they read a total of six books (each reading their own books and each other's).
7. Since they both read the same books, there is no duplication in the count.
8. Therefore, the total number of unique books they read collectively is six.
9. No additional units are required since the question asks for the number of books.
10. To summarize, Dolly and Pandora read six unique books between them.

- Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
- Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.

### 2. Calculate the number of fries Billy took.
- Billy took 5 fries + (5 fries * 2) = 11 fries.

### 3. Find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin.
- In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
- Subtract the number of fries taken by Kyle and Billy from the final number of fries Griffin had.
- Griffin started with 24 fries, Kyle took 5, and Billy took 11. So, Griffin had 24 + 5 + 11 = 30 fries - 21 (taken by Kyle and Billy) = 9 fries more than the final number.
- Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 9 fries.

### 4. Verify the answer.
- Griffin started with 24 fries.
- Kyle took 5, Billy took 11, and Griffin had 9 fries from Ginger.
- In total, Griffin lost 5 + 11 = 16 fries and gained 9 fries.

- There are 20 sections in a 200-foot tree (since each section is 10 feet long).

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the undamaged wood
- One section of the tree weighs 400 pounds.
- There are 20 sections in the tree.
- The total weight of the undamaged wood is 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

### Step 4: Calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites
- The termites ate 30% of the wood.
- The weight of the eaten wood is 8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

### Step 5: Calculate the weight of the remaining wood
- The weight of the remaining wood is the total weight of the wood minus the weight of the eaten wood.
- The weight of the remaining wood is 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

### Step 6: Convert pounds to tons for easier understanding
- One ton is equal to 2000 pounds.
- The weight of the remaining wood is 5600 pounds / 2000 pounds/ton = 2.8 tons.

### The answer is: The redwood tree weighs approximately 2.8 tons.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

<step-1>. First, we need to find out how many pennies make up two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup.

<step-2>. Two thirds of 9,300 pennies is equal to (2/3) * 9,300.

<step-3>. Calculate the value: (2/3) * 9,300 = 3,233.33 (approximately). Since we're looking for the number of pennies, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: 3,233 pennies.

<step-4>. Now, we need to convert the number of pennies to dollars.

<step-5>. One penny is equal to $0.01.

<step-6>. To find the total number of dollars, multiply the number of pennies by $0.01: 3,233 pennies * $0.01/penny = $32.33.

<step-7>. However, the question asks for the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, not the exact amount. Since we rounded down the number of pennies, the total dollar amount will be slightly less than $32.33.

<step-8>. To find a close approximation, we can round up the number of pennies to the next multiple of 100: 3,240 pennies.

<step-9>. Convert the rounded number of pennies to dollars: 3,240 pennies * $0.01/penny = $32.40.

<step-10>. Our final answer is an approximation, so we'll state it as: \boxed{$32.40}.

## Solution to the Problem

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 312 M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 150 M&Ms.
4. To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, add the number of M&Ms in each bag.
5. Total M&Ms = M&Ms in first bag + M&Ms in second bag + M&Ms in third bag
6. Total M&Ms = 300 + 312 + 150
7. Total M&Ms = 762
8. However, since the third bag had a hole and only had half the number of M&Ms it should have had, we need to adjust the total.
9. The third bag should have had 300 M&Ms, so we need to add the difference between what Mary thought she bought and what she actually bought.
10. The difference is the number of M&Ms in the third bag that Mary didn't get, which is 150 M&Ms.

#### Final Result
Mary got a total of 762 + 150 = 912 M&Ms.

- We know that 2/5 of the cards have the letter A.
- So, the number of cards with A is 80 * (2/5) = 64.

### 2. Next, we need to find out how many cards have the letter B on them.
- We know that 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B.
- So, the number of cards with B is 80 - 64 = 16.

### 3. Then, we need to find out how many cards have the letter C on them.
- We know that 5/8 of the rest of the cards have the letter C.
- Let's find out how many cards are left after A and B have been distributed: 80 - 64 - 16 = 10.
- The number of cards with C is 10 * (5/8) = 6.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to 7 cards with C.

### 4. Finally, we need to find out how many cards have the letter D on them.
- The number of cards with D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with A, B, and C: 80 - 64 - 16 - 7 = 11.

First, let's find the individual ages of Mico and Marco based on the given information that their total age is 20.

### Step 2:
Since we don't have enough information to determine their ages exactly, we can assume that one of them is older and the other is younger. Let's assume Mico is older and Marco is younger.

### Step 3:
To find the difference in their ages, let's divide the total age by 2.

```markdown
Total age = 20
Age difference = Total age / 2
Age difference = 20 / 2
Age difference = 10
```

### Step 4:
Now, we know that Mico is older by 10 years. In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will have aged by 10 years each.

### Step 5:
Let's calculate the new age of Mico:

```markdown
Current age of Mico = Current age difference + Current age of Marco
Current age of Mico = 10 + Age(Marco)
```

### Step 6:
Let's calculate the new age of Marco:

```markdown
Current age of Marco = Current age difference - Current age of Mico
Current age of Marco = 10 - Age(Mico)
```

### Step 7:
Now, let's calculate their ages in 10 years:

```markdown
New age of Mico = Current age of Mico + 10
New age of Mico = 10 + Age(Marco) + 10
New age of Mico = Age(Mico) + Age(Marco) + 10

New age of Marco = Current age of Marco + 10
New age of Marco = 10 - Age(Mico) + 10
New age of Marco = Age(Mico) + Age(Marco) + 10
```

### Step 8:
Since we assumed Mico is older, the actual ages will be the negative of the age difference.

```markdown
Current age of Mico = Age(Mico) = 10 + Age(Marco)
Current age of Marco = Age(Marco) = 10 - Age(Mico)
```

### Step 9:
Now, let's calculate their ages in 10 years based on their current ages:

```markdown
New age of Mico = Current age of Mico + 10 = 2 * (Current age of Mico)
New age of Mico = 2 * (10 + Age(Marco))

New age of Marco = Current age of Marco + 10 = 2 * (Current age of Marco)
New age of Marco = 2 * (10 - Age(Mico))
```

### Step 10:
To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we can substitute the current ages with the expressions we found in Step 8:

```markdown
Sum of their ages in 10 years = New age of Mico + New age of Marco
Sum of their ages in 10 years = 2 * (10 + Age(Marco)) + 2 * (10 - Age(Mico))
Sum of their ages in 10 years = 20 + 2 * (Age(Marco) - Age(Mico))
```

### The answer is:
The sum of their ages in 10 years is 20 + 2 * (Age(Marco) - Age(Mico)).",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints1MathFormat'}

<4. We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Ruby's and Sam's ages: 6S = Ruby's age, 3S + 9 = Ruby's age in 9 years.
<5. Solving the system of equations, we find that S = 3.
<6. Substituting S = 3 into the first equation, we get Ruby's age: Ruby's age = 6 * 3 = 18.

Calculate the length of topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Each topaz gemstone is one inch long.
- There are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- So, the total length of topaz gemstones is 1 inch * 8 = 8 inches.

### Step 2:
Calculate the length of sterling silver beads per necklace.
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length of topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Subtract the length of topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of sterling silver beads.

**Step 3** Calculate the exercise time Peter wants to achieve on Tuesday.
- Exercise time on Tuesday: 39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

**Step 4** Check if the calculated exercise time is reasonable.
- 78 minutes is a significant amount of time for a single exercise session, and it might not be practical for Peter to exercise for that long in one go.

**Step 5** Consider if Peter might have meant to exercise for a total of twice the amount he usually does in a week, rather than in a single day.

**Step 6** Calculate the total exercise time Peter does in a week.
- Exercise time on Sunday: 23 minutes
- Exercise time on Monday: 16 minutes
- Total exercise time in a week: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes

**Step 7** Determine the exercise time Peter wants to achieve in a week.
- Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount he usually does: 39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

**Step 8** Check if the calculated exercise time is reasonable for a week.
- 78 minutes of exercise per week is a reasonable goal for most people.

**Step 9** Divide the weekly exercise goal by the number of days in a week to find the daily exercise goal.
- Daily exercise goal: 78 minutes / 7 days = approximately 11 minutes per day

- The tabloid has 32 pages.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of sheets required
- Each sheet of paper will have two pages (front and back).
- So, the number of sheets needed is equal to the number of pages divided by 2.

### Step 3: Find the total number of sheets
- Total number of sheets = Number of pages / 2
- Total number of sheets = 32 / 2

### Step 4: Round up if necessary
- Since we cannot have a fraction of a sheet, we round up to the nearest whole number.

### Step 5: Account for the back cover
- In addition to the content pages, there is usually a back cover.
- This requires an extra sheet.

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of sheets with back cover
- Total number of sheets = Number of content sheets + 1 (for back cover)
- Total number of sheets = (32 / 2) + 1

### Step 7: Simplify the calculation
- Total number of sheets = 16 + 1

### Step 1:
Determine the number of loaves sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of the total production are sold in the morning.
So, number of loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * Total loaves

### Step 2:
Calculate the number of loaves left after morning sales.
Total loaves = 60
Loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60

### Step 3:
Determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon.
So, number of loaves sold in the afternoon = 0.5 * Remaining loaves

### Step 4:
Calculate the number of loaves remaining after morning sales.
Loaves sold in the morning = (2/3) * 60

### Step 5:
Determine the number of loaves sold in the evening.
The remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
So, number of loaves sold in the evening = 0.5 * Remaining loaves

### Step 6:
Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined.
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening = Remaining loaves

### Step 7:
Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total production to find the number of loaves remaining.
Remaining loaves = Total loaves - Loaves sold in the morning

### Step 8:
Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = 0.5 * Remaining loaves

### Step 9:
Check if the calculation is reasonable.
The total number of loaves produced is 60, and two-thirds of that is sold in the morning. So, there should be approximately 20 loaves left for the afternoon and evening.

### Step 10:
State the final result.
Number of loaves sold in the afternoon = 0.5 * Remaining loaves

### 1. Calculate the savings on one tub of ice cream
- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.
- The discounted price is $11.
- The savings on one tub is the difference between the original and discounted prices.

### 2. Calculate the savings on one packet of milk
- The original price of one packet of milk is not given.
- The discount is $0.5.
- Since the discount is not applied to the original price, but rather taken off the final price, the original price of one packet of milk is the final price minus the discount.
- Let's assume the final price of one packet of milk is $X.
- The savings on one packet is $0.5.
- To find the original price, subtract the savings from the final price: X = X - 0.5
- Solving for X, we find X = $0.5 more than the final price.

**Step 2**: We know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so J = Q - 3.

**Step 3**: We also know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so T = J + 5.

**Step 4**: Substitute J = Q - 3 into the equation T = J + 5 to get T = Q - 3 + 5.

**Step 5**: Simplify the equation to T = Q + 2.

**Step 6**: Given that Quinn is 30 years old, we can substitute Q with 30 in the equation T = Q + 2.

### 1. Notation
Let's denote:
- `x` as the number of old records each person brings in
- `y` as the number of new records each person leaves with

### 2. Given information
Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record.
5 people come in and leave with a total of 7 new records between them.

### 3. Relationship between old and new records
From the given information, we know that:
- For each person, they trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
- So, for each person, the number of old records they bring in is twice the number of new records they leave with.

### 4. Total number of new records
We know that 5 people leave with a total of 7 new records between them.

### 5. Finding the number of new records for one person
Let's find the number of new records one person leaves with:
- Since there are 5 people and they leave with a total of 7 new records, the number of new records one person leaves with is `7 / 5 = 1.4` (approximately).
- However, since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, it's not possible for one person to leave with a fraction of a new record.
- Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer value of `x` such that `2x >= y`.

### 6. Finding the smallest integer value of `x`
To find the smallest integer value of `x`, we need to find the smallest integer value of `y` such that `2x >= y`.
- Since one person leaves with approximately 1.4 new records, the smallest integer value of `y` that satisfies the condition `2x >= y` is 2.
- So, each person leaves with 2 new records.

### 7. Finding the number of old records one person brings in
Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record and leaves with 2 new records, the number of old records one person brings in is `2 * 2 = 4`.

### 8. Finding the total number of old records brought in by all 5 people
Since there are 5 people and each person brings in 4 old records, the total number of old records brought in is `5 * 4 = 20`.

### 9. Checking the solution
We have found that each person brings in 4 old records and leaves with 2 new records.
5 people come in and leave with a total of 7 new records between them.
So, the total number of old records brought in is `5 * 4 = 20`, and the total number of new records they leave with is `5 * 2 = 10`.
The total number of new records they leave with is indeed equal to the total number of old records they brought in.

### 10. Final answer
The answer is:
5 people bring in a total of 20 old records.

**Step 2.** Since there are 200 students in total and there are 3 groups, the sum of the number of students in all groups should be equal to 200.

**Step 3.** Therefore, we have the equation: `x + x + (x - 10) = 200`.

**Step 4.** Simplifying the equation, we get: `2x - 10 = 200`.

**Step 5.** Adding 10 to both sides, we have: `2x = 210`.

**Step 6.** Dividing both sides by 2, we find: `x = 105.5`.

**Step 7.** However, since the number of students must be an integer, `x` cannot be 105.5. Instead, we need to find the closest integer value to 105.5 that satisfies the condition.

**Step 8.** Trying `x = 105`, we find that the total number of students in the two larger groups is `2 * 105 = 210`, which is equal to the total number of students.

**Step 9.** Therefore, each of the two larger groups has 105 students, and the smallest group has `200 - 2 * 105 = 190` students.

**Step 10.** However, we made an error in our calculation in step 8. The correct calculation should be `2 * 105 = 210`, and since there are 3 groups, the total number of students should be `3 * 105 = 315`. This means that our initial assumption that 2 groups have 105 students each and the third group has 10 less students is incorrect.

**Final result.** Based on the correct calculation, the smallest group should have `200 - 2 * 105 = 190` students. However, this result is not possible since it leads to a total of 315 students, which is more than the initial number of 200 students.

- John spent 6 hours boating
- He spent half that time swimming, which is 3 hours
- Total time spent on boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

### Step 2: Calculate the time John spent watching shows
- He watched 3 different shows, each was 2 hours long
- Total time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

### Step 3: Determine the percentage of time spent on each activity
- John spent 30% of his time watching shows: 6 hours
- He spent 40% of his time sightseeing: Unknown

### Step 4: Find the total time John spent on vacation
- The time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is 9 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours

### Step 5: Calculate the time John spent sightseeing
- We know that John spent 30% of his time watching shows, so 40% of his time must have been spent sightseeing
- To find the time spent sightseeing, we can set up a proportion: 6 hours (watching shows) / 0.3 * Total time = X hours (sightseeing) / 0.4
- Solving for X, we get: X = (0.4 * Total time) / 0.3
- Substituting the value of Total time (15 hours), we get: X = (0.4 * 15) / 0.3 ≈ 13.33 hours

359," **Step 1** Determine the amount of money Billy had left after buying candy.
- Billy started with $10.
- He spent $1.5 per pound on candy.
- Let x be the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
- The cost of the candy is 1.5x.
- Billy's change is $10 - 1.5x.

**Step 2** Determine the amount of money Billy spent on gumballs.
- Billy spent half of his change on gumballs.
- The cost of a gumball is $.05.
- Let y be the number of gumballs Billy bought.
- The cost of the gumballs is 0.05y.

**Step 3** Set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
- The total amount of money Billy spent is the cost of the candy plus the cost of the gumballs.
- The equation is: 1.5x + 0.05y = $10

**Step 4** Solve the equation for x.
- First, subtract 0.05y from both sides of the equation.
- Then, divide both sides by 1.5.
- x = (10 - 0.05y) / 1.5

**Step 5** Determine the number of gumballs Billy bought.
- Billy bought 40 gumballs.
- The cost of the gumballs is 0.05y.
- 0.05y = 2 (since 40 gumballs cost $2)
- y = 40 / 0.05
- y = 800

**Step 6** Substitute the value of y back into the equation for x.
- x = (10 - 0.05(800)) / 1.5
- x = (10 - 40) / 1.5
- x = 6

**Step 7** Calculate the weight of the candy Billy bought.
- The weight of the candy is x pounds.
- x = 6

**Step 8** Determine the number of pounds in 40 gumballs.
- Each gumball weighs nothing.
- The weight of 40 gumballs is 0 pounds.

**Step 9** Find the total weight of the candy and gumballs Billy bought.

First, let's determine the total number of points Jane has earned from the first two tests.

- Jane scored 15 points on the first test.
- Jane scored 18 points on the second test.

### Step 2:
Now, let's calculate the minimum number of points Jane needs to score on the third test to reach the required total of 42 points.

- The total number of points Jane has earned so far is 15 + 18 = 33.
- To reach a total of 42 points, Jane needs to score 42 - 33 = 9 more points.

### Step 3:
Since we know that Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test, we can provide some possible scenarios where she reaches exactly 9, 10, or even more points.

- Scenario 1: Jane scores exactly 9 points on the third test.
- Scenario 2: Jane scores 10 points on the third test.
- Scenario 3: Jane scores more than 10 points on the third test.

### Step 4:
Let's analyze each scenario to determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test.

#### Scenario 1:
If Jane scores exactly 9 points on the third test, her total score will be 33 + 9 = 42 points, which is the minimum requirement.

#### Scenario 2:
If Jane scores 10 points on the third test, her total score will be 33 + 10 = 43 points. In this case, she has exceeded the minimum requirement, but it is still a valid outcome.

#### Scenario 3:
If Jane scores more than 10 points on the third test, her total score will be greater than 42 points. While this is not a problem, it is not the minimum number of points she needs to score to pass.

  - Let's assume the cost per piece is $X.
  - Total pieces = Total value / Cost per piece = $400000 / X

### 3. Calculate the number of faulty pieces
- 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty.
- Faulty pieces = 0.4 * Total pieces

### 4. Determine the value of the faulty pieces
- The value of the faulty pieces is the cost of those pieces.
- Cost of faulty pieces = Faulty pieces * Cost per piece

### 5. Subtract the cost of the faulty pieces from the total value
- The company paid for both the functioning and faulty pieces.
- Total cost = Cost of functioning pieces + Cost of faulty pieces
- To find the cost of the functioning pieces, subtract the cost of the faulty pieces from the total cost.

### 6. Calculate the cost of the functioning pieces
- Total cost = Cost of functioning pieces + Cost of faulty pieces
- Total cost = (Cost of functioning pieces) + (Faulty pieces * Cost per piece)
- Solve for Cost of functioning pieces

### 7. Simplify the equation
- Cost of functioning pieces = Total cost - (Faulty pieces * Cost per piece)

### 8. Substitute the known values
- Cost of functioning pieces = $400000 - ((0.4 * Total pieces) * Cost per piece)

### 9. Solve for the cost of the functioning pieces
- To find the cost of the functioning pieces, we need to know the total number of pieces and the cost per piece.
- Unfortunately, we only have the total value and the percentage of faulty pieces.
- Without this information, we cannot determine the exact cost of the functioning pieces.

### 10. Conclusion
- We cannot determine the exact cost of the functioning pieces based on the given information.

### Final result
- The answer is: Unable to determine the cost of the functioning pieces.

- Lucy sells apples for $4 each.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked that day.
- The money she received from selling the apples on Monday was $56.

### Step 2:
- Let's denote the number of apples picked on Monday as `x`.
- The revenue from selling these apples is `$56 = $4x`.

### Step 3:
- On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.
- So, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is `2 * 12 = 24`.

### Step 4:
- The total number of apples picked over the three days is `x + 12 + 24`.

### Step 5:
- We know that the revenue from selling the apples picked on Monday was $56.
- Using the given price per apple, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday: `$56 = $4x => x = 14`.

### Step 6:
- Substituting the value of `x` back into the equation for the total number of apples picked, we get: `14 + 12 + 24 = 42`.

- Nancy counted 90 spiders.
- Let's find out how many millipedes she saw.
- We know that 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders were present.

### Step 2:
- To find the number of millipedes, we need to calculate 1/3rd of 90.
- Millipedes = Spiders * (1/3)
- Millipedes = 90 * (1/3)
- Millipedes = 30

### Step 3:
- Now, we know that there are twice the number of millipedes as stink bugs.
- Let's find out how many stink bugs she saw.
- Stink bugs = Millipedes * 2 - 12
- Stink bugs = 30 * 2 - 12
- Stink bugs = 58

### Step 4:
- Nancy counted 90 spiders, 30 millipedes, and 58 stink bugs.

- So, Beth's age is E - 5.

### Step 2:
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
- Therefore, Alice's age is (E - 5) + 7.

### Step 3:
- We are asked to find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages.
- This difference is equal to Alice's age minus Erica's age.

### Step 4:
- Substitute the expressions for Alice's and Erica's ages from the previous steps.
- The difference is equal to [(E - 5) + 7] - E.

### Step 5:
- Simplify the expression.
- The difference is equal to 7 - 5.

### Step 6:
- The result of the subtraction is 2.

Calculate the energy usage per hour by Mel's air conditioner.
- Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner.
- Therefore, his energy usage per hour is 900 watts.

### Step 2:
Determine the number of hours Mel uses the air conditioner each day with the reduction.
- Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
- So, he now uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.

### Step 3:
Calculate the energy usage per day with the reduction.
- Mel's energy usage per hour is 900 watts.
- He uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.
- Therefore, his energy usage per day is 2700 watts (3 hours * 900 watts).

### Step 4:
Convert the daily energy usage from watts to kilowatts.
- 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
- Mel's daily energy usage is 2700 watts.
- To find his daily energy usage in kilowatts, divide the wattage by 1000.
- Mel uses 2.7 kilowatts of electric energy per day.

### Step 5:
Calculate the energy savings per day with the reduction.
- Mel's original energy usage was 900 watts per hour * 8 hours a day = 7200 watts or 7.2 kilowatts per day.
- With the reduction, he uses 2.7 kilowatts per day.
- Therefore, his energy savings per day is 4.5 kilowatts (7.2 kilowatts - 2.7 kilowatts).

### Step 6:

- So, she eats 2 * 7 = \boxed{14} cookies per week.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of cookies Shannon needs for 30 days.
- There are 30 days in a month.
- She needs enough cookies for 30 days.
- Therefore, she needs 14 * 30 = \boxed{420} cookies.

**Step 3** Determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make.
- One dozen is equal to 12 cookies.
- So, Shannon needs to make 420 / 12 = \boxed{35} dozens of cookies.

**Step 4** Check if the calculated number of dozens is correct.
- Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen cookies.
- To make 35 dozens of cookies, she would need to make 35 * 12 = \boxed{420} cookies.
- This matches the number of cookies she needs, so her calculation is correct.

**Step 5** Consider potential limitations.
- Shannon may not have the space or resources to make 420 cookies at once.
- She may need to make the cookies in smaller batches and freeze them as she goes.

**Step 6** Plan for baking and freezing the cookies.
- Shannon can make the cookies in batches of 1 dozen and freeze them as soon as they cool.
- She can bake and freeze 3 batches per week to have enough cookies for the month.

**Step 7** Ensure proper storage of the frozen cookies.
- Shannon should store the frozen cookies in an airtight container or freezer bag to prevent freezer burn and maintain their freshness.

**Step 8** Consider the impact on her budget.
- Making 420 cookies may require a larger investment in ingredients and baking supplies than Shannon initially anticipated.
- She may need to adjust her budget or find cost-saving measures, such as using basic ingredients or buying them in bulk.

**Step 9** Plan for the convenience of having pre-made cookies.
- Having a supply of pre-made cookies in the freezer can save Shannon time and effort in the kitchen.
- She can simply take out a few cookies as needed and enjoy them as a treat without having to bake a new batch every time.

**Step 10** Enjoy the fruits of her labor.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as `x`.

### Step 2:
From the problem, we know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 60 apples.

### Step 3:
Joanne gathers half the amount of apples from the shortest trees that she does from the tallest trees. So, she gathers `30/2 = 15` apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is `15 * 3 = 45` apples.

### Step 4:
The total number of apples the sisters have gathered is 500. So, we can write the equation:

```
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
```

### Step 5:
Simplify the equation:

```
130 + x = 500
```

### Step 6:
Subtract 130 from both sides:

```
x = 370
```

### Step 7:
However, this answer is incorrect because we have assumed that all the apples were gathered from the tall, short, and average trees. But the problem states that Joanne didn't gather any apples from the average trees while her sister didn't take any from them.

### Step 8:
Let's reconsider the problem and assume that all the apples Joanne gathered were from the tall and short trees, and her sister gathered all the apples from the average trees.

### Step 9:
Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and her sister gathers 60 apples from them, together they have gathered 90 apples from the tallest trees.

### Step 10:
Since Joanne gathers half as many apples from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, she gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 45 apples. Together, they have gathered 60 apples from the shortest trees.

- Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.
- We know that camels have two humps each, so they have 2C heads and 2C humps.
- Dromedaries have one hump each, so they have 1D head and 1D hump.

### Step 2:
- From the problem statement, we have 180 heads and 304 bumps in total.
- Therefore, 2C + 1D = 180 (total number of heads)
- 2C = 180 - D (heads of camels)
- C = 90 - D/2 (number of camels)

### Step 3:
- We also know that 2C humps = 304 (total number of bumps)
- Substituting C from the equation in Step 2, we get 2(90 - D/2) = 304

### Step 4:
- Solving for D, we find that D = 62 (number of dromedaries)

### Step 5:
- To check the solution, we can calculate the number of camels: C = 90 - D/2 = 90 - 62/2 = 62

### Step 6:
- The number of camels and dromedaries should add up to the total number of animals, which is not explicitly stated in the problem but can be inferred from the given information.
- So, C + D = 180/2 = 90
- With C = 62 and D = 62, this condition is satisfied.

- Cole bought tattered jeans for $28.

### Step 2: Determine the cost of jogger jeans
- The cost difference between tattered and jogger jeans is $6.
- Therefore, the cost of jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.

### Step 3: Calculate the savings from jogger jeans
- Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
- The total savings is the difference in cost between the two types of jeans, which is $6.
- So, the savings from jogger jeans is 1/3 * $6 = $2.

### Step 4: Calculate the savings from tattered jeans
- The total savings is $6.
- The savings from jogger jeans is $2.
- Therefore, the savings from tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.

### Step 5: Determine the original cost of jogger jeans
- The cost difference between tattered and jogger jeans is $6.
- Cole saved $2 from jogger jeans and $4 from tattered jeans.
- To find the original cost of jogger jeans, we need to find the cost difference between the two types of jeans and subtract the savings from both.
- The original cost difference is $6.
- The savings from jogger jeans is $2.
- The savings from tattered jeans is $4.
- Therefore, the original cost of jogger jeans is $6 (cost difference) - $2 (savings from jogger jeans) - $4 (savings from tattered jeans) = $0.

### Step 6: Calculate the error in the problem statement
- The problem statement states that Cole saved a total of $6.
- However, the actual total savings is $6 - $2 (jogger jeans) - $4 (tattered jeans) = $0.
- This indicates an error in the problem statement.

### Step 7: Revise the problem statement
- The correct problem statement should state that Cole spent a total of $54 on both pairs of jeans ($28 for tattered jeans and $26 for jogger jeans).
- He saved $4 on the tattered jeans and $2 on the jogger jeans, for a total savings of $6.

### Step 8: Calculate the original cost difference between tattered and jogger jeans
- The cost difference between tattered and jogger jeans is $6.
- Cole saved $4 on tattered jeans and $2 on jogger jeans, for a total savings of $6.
- Therefore, the original cost difference between tattered and jogger jeans is $6 (cost difference) - $4 (savings from tattered jeans) - $2 (savings from jogger jeans) = $0.
- However, since there was an error in the original problem statement, this calculation is not valid.

- The price of one chip bag is 40 cents.
- George spent $5 on chips.
- To find out how many chip bags he bought, divide the total amount spent on chips by the price of one chip bag.

```
Number of chip bags = Total amount spent on chips / Price per chip bag
Number of chip bags = $5 / 40 cents
Number of chip bags = 12.5
```

Since George can't buy half a bag, he bought 12 chip bags.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount George spent on chips
- George bought 12 chip bags.
- Each chip bag costs 40 cents.

```
Total amount spent on chips = Number of chip bags * Price per chip bag
Total amount spent on chips = 12 * 40 cents
Total amount spent on chips = $4.80
```

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount George spent on candy bars
- George spent a total of $5.
- The total amount spent on chips is $4.80.
- Subtract the total amount spent on chips from the total amount spent to find the total amount spent on candy bars.

```
Total amount spent on candy bars = Total amount spent - Total amount spent on chips
Total amount spent on candy bars = $5 - $4.80
Total amount spent on candy bars = $0.20
```

### Step 4: Determine how many candy bars George bought
- The price of one candy bar is 75 cents.
- George spent $0.20 on candy bars.

```
Number of candy bars = Total amount spent on candy bars / Price per candy bar
Number of candy bars = $0.20 / 75 cents
Number of candy bars = 0.00266667
```

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he bought 0 candy bars.

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of money George spent on chips
- George spent $4.80 on chips.
- He spent a total of $5.

```
Percentage of money spent on chips = (Total amount spent on chips / Total amount spent) * 100%
Percentage of money spent on chips = ($4.80 / $5) * 100%
Percentage of money spent on chips = 96%
```

### Step 6: Calculate the percentage of money George spent on candy bars
- George spent $0.20 on candy bars.
- He spent a total of $5.

```
Percentage of money spent on candy bars = (Total amount spent on candy bars / Total amount spent) * 100%
Percentage of money spent on candy bars = ($0.20 / $5) * 100%
Percentage of money spent on candy bars = 4%
```

### Step 7: Calculate the number of candy bars George could have bought with the remaining 1% of his money
- George spent 96% of his money on chips.
- He had 1% of his money left.
- Calculate the total amount of money George had.
- Subtract the total amount spent on chips to find the amount of money spent on candy bars.

```
Total amount of money George had = Total amount spent on chips / (1 - Percentage of money spent on chips)
Total amount of money George had = $4.80 / (1 - 0.96)
Total amount of money George had = $5

Amount of money spent on candy bars = Total amount of money George had * Percentage of money spent on candy bars
Amount of money spent on candy bars = $5 * 0.01
Amount of money spent on candy bars = $0.05

Number of candy bars George could have bought = Amount of money spent on candy bars / Price per candy bar
Number of candy bars George could have bought = $0.05 / 75 cents
Number of candy bars George could have bought = 0.00066667

437," **Step 1** Calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have.
- Sitti bought 34 oranges.
- Juris bought 22 oranges.
- Total oranges = 34 (Sitti's) + 22 (Juris') = 56 oranges

**Step 2** Determine the number of oranges for each person when shared equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends.
- Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends are a total of 9 people.
- Oranges per person = Total oranges / Number of people
- Oranges per person = 56 / 9

**Step 3** Calculate the exact number of oranges each person will get.
- Oranges per person = 56 / 9 ≈ 6.22
- Since it's not possible to distribute a fraction of an orange, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

**Step 4** Determine the number of oranges for each person when rounded down.
- Oranges per person = 6

**Step 5** Calculate the total number of oranges needed for everyone.
- Total oranges for everyone = Oranges per person * Number of people
- Total oranges for everyone = 6 * 9 = 54 oranges

**Step 6** Check if the total number of oranges for everyone is enough to cover the initial amount of oranges Sitti and Juris bought.
- Total oranges for everyone = 54
- Initial total oranges = 56
- The total number of oranges for everyone is not enough to cover the initial amount.

**Step 7** Distribute the remaining oranges among the friends.
- There are 2 extra oranges (56 - 54).
- Each friend will get an additional orange.

**Step 8** Calculate the total number of oranges each friend will get.
- Total oranges per friend = Oranges per person + 1 (extra orange)
- Total oranges per friend = 6 + 1 = 7 oranges

**Step 9** Confirm the total number of oranges for everyone.
- Total oranges for everyone = 54 (from Step 5) + 2 (remaining oranges) * 6 (friends) = 54 + 12 = 66 oranges

- Antoine wants to double the amount of onions for 6 people
- Original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions for 6 people
- To serve 12 people, he needs 2 * 6 = **12 pounds** of onions

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of onions
- Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound
- The cost of 12 pounds of onions is 12 * $2.00 = **$24.00**

### Step 3: Determine the amount of beef stock for 12 people
- Recipe does not specify how much beef stock is needed per serving
- Assuming the same ratio as onions, we need 2 boxes for 6 people
- To serve 12 people, we need 2 * 6 = **12 boxes** of beef stock

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of beef stock
- Beef stock is currently on sale for $2.00 a box
- The cost of 12 boxes of beef stock is 12 * $2.00 = **$24.00**

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost

### 2. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the house temperature rises by 3 * 5 = \boxed{15} degrees during baking.

### 3. After baking, the house temperature is 40 + 15 = \boxed{55} degrees.

### 4. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, which is equal to 0.5 hours.

### 5. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the house temperature decreases by 0.5 * (2 * 0.17) = \boxed{0.17} degrees per minute.

### 6. The house temperature decreases by 0.17 * 0.5 = \boxed{0.085} degrees during the 30 minutes the window is open.

### 7. After opening the window, the house temperature is 55 - 0.085 = \boxed{54.915} degrees.

### 8. Since we cannot have a fraction of a degree, we round the final temperature to the nearest whole number.

### 9. The final temperature of the house is \boxed{55} degrees.

### 10. However, we made an error in our calculation. The correct calculation should be: the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so it cools down 0.2 degrees per minute.

- The horse runs at 32 MPH.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.
- To find the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time
- Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

**Step 2** Calculate the amount of hay the horse needs for this distance.
- For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- So, for 16 miles, the horse needs: Hay = Miles * Hay per mile
- Hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

**Step 3** Calculate the cost of the hay.
- Each bail of hay costs $3.
- So, the cost of 8 bails of hay is: Cost = Number of bails * Cost per bail
- Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

**Step 4** Determine how much money Michael has.
- Michael has six $5 bills.
- So, Michael has a total of: Money = Number of $5 bills * Value of each $5 bill
- Money = 6 * $5 = $30

**Step 5** Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay.
- The cost of the hay is $24.
- Michael has $30.

- The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers.
- The total cost of the case was $576.
- Therefore, the cost price of each sneaker is $576 / 48 = $11.71 (approximately).

**Step 2** Calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at the flash sale.
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each.
- The revenue from selling these sneakers is 17 * $20 = $340.

**Step 3** Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store.
- The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left after the flash sale.
- He sold all of these sneakers to the department store for $25 each.
- Therefore, he sold 31 sneakers to the department store.

**Step 4** Calculate the revenue from selling sneakers to the department store.
- The revenue from selling sneakers to the department store is 31 * $25 = $805.

**Step 5** Calculate the total revenue from selling all the sneakers.
- The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is $340 (flash sale) + $805 (department store) = $1,145.

**Step 6** Calculate the total cost of buying the sneakers.
- The total cost of buying the sneakers was $576.

**Step 7** Calculate the salesman's profit.
- The salesman's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.
- Therefore, his profit is $1,145 - $576 = $569.

**Step 8** Check if the calculation is correct.
- The cost price of each sneaker was approximately $11.71.
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale was $340.
- He sold 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each, so the revenue from selling to the department store was $805.

- Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies.
- The number of cookies he can have is dependent on the number of carrot sticks he eats.

### Step 2:
- Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
- He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

### Step 3:
- Let's denote the number of carrot sticks as `x`.
- The number of cookies Matt gets is `x/2 + 2`.

### Step 4:
- Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies.
- So, `x/2 + 2 = 5`.

### Step 5:
- To find the value of `x`, we need to solve the equation `x/2 +2 =5`.

### Step 6:
- First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: `x/2 = 3`.

### Step 7:
- Next, multiply both sides by 2 to get `x = 6`.

### Step 8:
- Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to be able to have 5 cookies.

### Step 9:
- However, it's important to note that this equation assumes that Matt can eat a fraction of a cookie. In reality, he can't, so he would need to eat at least 7 carrot sticks to ensure he gets 5 cookies.

### Step 10:
- To meet the requirement of eating at least 7 carrot sticks, Matt should aim for eating 8 carrot sticks.

<2. Determine how many days it will take the child to save $8 with a daily savings of $2.>
- The child saves $2 per day.
- To find out how many days it takes to save $8, divide the total amount to be saved by the daily savings: $8 / $2 = 4 days.

<3. Check if the calculation is correct by multiplying the daily savings by the number of days.>
- The child saves $2 per day.
- He needs to save for 4 days.
- Therefore, he will save a total of $2/day * 4 days = $8.

<4. Consider the possibility of rounding errors or unexpected expenses.>
- In real life, there might be rounding errors or unexpected expenses that could affect the child's savings plan.
- However, since we are assuming the child saves exactly $2 per day and the toy car costs exactly $12, we can ignore this factor in our calculation.

<5. Consider the possibility of the child receiving extra money.>
- The child might receive extra money from sources such as birthday gifts or selling unused toys.
- If the child receives enough extra money to cover the cost of the toy car, then the number of saving days will be less than 4.
- However, since we don't have information about any potential extra income, we cannot include this factor in our calculation.

- The child might skip saving days due to various reasons such as forgetting or spending the money on other things.
- If the child skips saving days, it will take him longer than 4 days to save the remaining amount.
- However, since we are assuming the child saves exactly $2 per day, we cannot include this factor in our calculation.

<7. Consider the possibility of the child's allowance changing.>
- The child's allowance might change, which could affect the number of saving days.
- For example, if the child's allowance increases, he might be able to save the remaining amount faster.
- However, since we don't have information about any potential changes in the child's allowance, we cannot include this factor in our calculation.

<8. Consider the possibility of the child selling unwanted items.>
- The child might sell unwanted items to earn extra money and save the remaining amount faster.
- However, since we don't have information about any potential items the child could sell or their selling price, we cannot include this factor in our calculation.

<9. Consider the possibility of the child asking for help from family or friends.>
- The child might ask for help from family or friends to cover the remaining amount.

First, let's determine how old Brett will be in four years.

- Brett is currently 14 years old.
- In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = **18 years old**.

### Step 2:
Next, we know that Angela will be three times as old as Brett is at that time.

- Brett will be 18 years old in four years.
- Angela will be 3 * 18 = **54 years old**.

### Step 3:
However, we made an error in our calculation. We need to find Angela's age now, not in four years.

### Step 1:
First, let's find out how much the lot costs. We know that the house costs three times as much as the lot, and the total cost of the house and lot is $120,000.

### Step 2:
Let's denote the cost of the lot as L. The cost of the house is then 3L.

### Step 3:
We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

- House cost: 3L
- Lot cost: L
- Total cost: 3L + L

### Step 4:
Combine like terms: 4L

### Step 5:
We know that the total cost is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: 4L = $120,000

### Step 6:
Divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot: L = $30,000

### Step 7:
Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house: House cost = 3L = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

### Step 8:
Check our work: House cost + Lot cost = $90,000 + $30,000 = $120,000

### Step 9:
Our calculation checks out, so the house cost $90,000.

#### Final result:
The house cost $90,000.

<2.> Each bag cost her $4 to buy. Therefore, the total cost of all the bags was 40 * $4 = **$160**.
<3.> After painting, she sold each bag for $8 at the craft fair. So, her selling price for one bag was $8.
<4.> To find the profit per bag, subtract the cost from the selling price: $8 - $4 = **$4**.
<5.> Since she sold 40 bags, her total profit was 40 * $4 = **$160**.
<6.> However, she had initially spent $160 on buying the bags. So, her profit is the difference between what she earned from selling and what she spent on buying: $160 (selling) - $160 (buying) = **$0**.
<7.> In other words, she broke even, meaning she didn't make any profit or loss from selling the painted bags.
<8.> However, if we consider the cost of painting as a separate expense, then her profit would be the difference between her selling price and the total cost of the bags and painting.
<9.> Let's assume the cost of painting each bag was $2. So, the total cost of painting 40 bags would be 40 * $2 = **$80**.

### Step 4:
- The total number of days required for 2 people to paint a whole house is 5 days * 2 = 10 days.

### Step 5:
- Assuming each person works for 8 hours a day, the total number of hours required for 2 people to paint a whole house is 10 days * 8 hours/day * 2 people = 160 hours.

### 1. Let's denote the amount Brad gets as B.

### 2. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff's amount is 4B.

### 3. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation: B + 4B = 100.

### 4. Simplifying the equation, we get 5B = 100.

### 5. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that B = 20.

### 6. Substituting the value of B back into the equation for Jeff's amount, we get Jeff's amount as 4B = 4 * 20 = 80.

### 7. Jeff gets $80, and Brad gets $20.

## Step 1: Understand the problem
- We know that Jonathan's playset needs to be five times larger than James's playset, which has 80 toys.
- To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to determine how many toys James has per toy set and then multiply that number by five for Jonathan.

## Step 2: Calculate the number of toys in one set for James
- James's playset has 80 toys.
- To find out how many toys are in one set for James, we divide the total number of toys James has by the number of sets he has.

## Step 3: Determine the number of toys in one set for James
- One set for James = Total toys for James / Number of sets for James
- One set for James = 80 toys / 1 set
- One set for James = 80 toys

## Step 4: Calculate the number of toys Jonathan needs
- Jonathan's playset needs to be five times larger than James's playset.
- To find out how many toys Jonathan needs, we multiply the number of toys in one set for James by five.

## Step 5: Determine the number of toys Jonathan needs
- Toys for Jonathan = Toys for one set for James * Number of sets for Jonathan
- Toys for Jonathan = 80 toys * 5
- Toys for Jonathan = 400 toys

## Step 6: Find out how many toys Jonathan currently has
- We know that Jonathan currently has fewer toys than he needs for his larger playset.
- To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we can subtract the number of toys he needs from the number of toys he will have when his playset is five times larger than James'.

## Step 7: Determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has
- Current toys for Jonathan = Toys for Jonathan - (Toys for one set for James * (Number of sets for Jonathan - 1))
- Current toys for Jonathan = 400 toys - (80 toys * (5 - 1))
- Current toys for Jonathan = 400 toys - (80 toys * 4)
- Current toys for Jonathan = 400 toys - 320 toys
- Current toys for Jonathan = 80 toys

564," **Step 1** Find out how many minutes Judy read in the first week.
- She read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, she read for 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

**Step 2** Determine how many pages Judy read in the first week based on her reading speed.
- She can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.
- To find out how many pages she reads in one minute, divide the number of pages by the number of minutes: 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages per minute.
- In the first week, she read for 105 minutes, so she read 105 * 1.33 = 139.95 pages. Since she can't read a fraction of a page, we'll round down to 139 pages.

**Step 3** Find out how many minutes Judy read in the second week.
- She read a total of 100 pages.
- Using her reading speed, we know she can read 1.33 pages per minute.
- To find out how many minutes it took her to read 100 pages, divide the number of pages by her reading speed: 100 pages / 1.33 pages per minute = 75.2 minutes.

**Step 4** Determine how many minutes Judy read in total during both weeks.
- She read for 105 minutes in the first week.
- She read for 75.2 minutes in the second week.
- So, she read for a total of 105 + 75.2 = 180.2 minutes.

**Step 5** Find out how many pages Judy read in total during both weeks.
- In the first week, she read 139 pages.
- In the second week, she read 100 pages.
- So, she read a total of 139 pages + 100 pages = 239 pages.

- Let's denote the number of goals Mark scored as M.
- Let's denote the number of goals Anna scored as A.

### Step 2:
- From the problem statement, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so R = M + 20.
- We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so R = A + 45.

### Step 3:
- We're given that Richie scored 80 goals.
- Using the second equation from Step 2, we can write A = R - 45.

### Step 4:
- Substituting A in the first equation from Step 2, we get M = R - 20 - 45.
- Simplifying, we get M = R - 65.

### Step 5:
- Now we have two equations with two variables: R = M + 20 and R = A + 45.
- We can use the second equation to find A once we know R.

### Step 6:
- Substituting R = 80 in the second equation, we get A = 80 - 45 = 35.

### Step 7:
- Substituting R = 80 and A = 35 in the first equation, we get M = 80 - 20 = 60.

### Step 8:
- So, Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 35 goals.
- The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is the sum of their individual goals.

### Step 9:
- Total goals = Goals by Richie + Goals by Mark + Goals by Anna

- Liam made $63 in sales.
- Mitchell made $84 in sales.

- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, so she burns 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Hannah spends 1 hour running, so she burns 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.
- The total calories burned is 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

**Step 2** Determine how much water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories she burned.
- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

Let's denote the number of red jelly beans as R, the number of blue jelly beans as B, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

### Step 2:
According to the problem, R = 0.99B and G = 1.01B.

### Step 3:
The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. So, R + B + G = 4500.

### Step 4:
Substitute R and G with their respective expressions in terms of B: 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500.

### Step 5:
Combine the terms with B: 2.99B = 4500.

### Step 6:
Divide both sides by 2.99 to find the value of B: B = 1513.16 (approximately). Since the number of jelly beans must be an integer, we'll round this value to the nearest integer, which is 1514.

### Step 7:
Now, find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99 * 1514 = 1499.

### Step 8:
Find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01 * 1514 = 1531.

### Step 9:
Calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans: Difference = Green - Red = 1531 - 1499 = 32.

### 1. Understand the problem
- Mark plants a beanstalk below his window that is 20 feet off the ground.
- The beanstalk grows doubling its height every day.
- The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall.
- The goal is to find out how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than the window.

### 2. Set up the equation
- Let's denote the number of days as 'n'.
- The height of the beanstalk after 'n' days is given by the equation: Height = 4 * 2^n

### 3. Find the solution
1. We want the height of the beanstalk to be greater than 20 feet.
2. Set up the inequality: 4 * 2^n > 20
3. Divide both sides by 4: 2^n > 5
4. Take the logarithm base 2 of both sides: n > log2(5)
5. Calculate the value of log2(5): n > 2.321928095
6. Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
7. Therefore, n > 3
8. Test the value of n = 3: 4 * 2^3 = 12 > 20, so n = 3 is not enough.
9. Test the value of n = 4: 4 * 2^4 = 16 > 20, so n = 4 is enough.
10. The beanstalk will be taller than the window after 4 days.

### Final result:
It takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

## Step 1: Find out how many grams of protein John gets from eating 100 grams of mushrooms
- Each 100 grams of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein.

## Step 2: Determine how many grams of protein John gets from eating 200 grams of mushrooms
- John eats double the amount of mushrooms (200 grams), so he gets double the protein.
- Protein intake from 200 grams of mushrooms = 2 * Protein intake from 100 grams of mushrooms

## Step 3: Calculate the protein intake from 200 grams of mushrooms
- Protein intake from 200 grams of mushrooms = 2 * 3 grams

## Step 4: Find out how many grams of protein John gets from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day
- John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so his daily protein intake from mushrooms is the same as the protein intake from 200 grams of mushrooms.

## Step 5: Calculate the weekly protein intake from mushrooms
- There are 7 days in a week, so John's weekly protein intake from mushrooms is 7 times his daily protein intake.

## Step 6: Calculate the weekly protein intake from mushrooms (continued)
- Weekly protein intake from mushrooms = Daily protein intake * 7 days

## Step 7: Calculate the weekly protein intake from mushrooms (final)
- Weekly protein intake from mushrooms = 3 grams/day * 7 days

## Step 8: Convert grams to a more common unit for protein measurement (optional)
- Protein is typically measured in grams, but it can also be measured in other units like ounces or kilograms. Since the initial problem was given in grams, no conversion is needed.

## Step 9: State the final result
- John gets 21 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

## Step 10: Final result without any extra unit

First, we need to determine how old Charmaine will be in 12 years. We are given that she will be 16 years old at that time.

### Step 2:
To find out her age 12 years from now, we can simply add 12 years to her current age (which we don't know). However, we are given that she will be 16 years old in 12 years.

### Step 3:
Since we know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Current Age + 12 = 16

### Step 4:
To find her current age, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

Current Age = 16 - 12

### Step 5:
Current Age = 4

### 1. First, we need to find out how many miles Reggie ran. We know that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:

- Reggie's miles = 5 * Paisley's miles

### 2. Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so:

- Reggie's miles = Paisley's miles * 5 + 3

### 3. Given that Paisley ran 4 miles, we can now calculate Reggie's miles:

- Reggie's miles = 5 * 4 + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 miles

### 4. Now, we know that Reggie ran 24 miles and Lynn ran fewer miles than Reggie. So, we can calculate Lynn's miles:

- Lynn's miles = Reggie's miles - 3 miles

### 5. Let's double-check our calculations:

- Reggie's miles = 5 * Paisley's miles + 3
- Reggie's miles = 5 * 4 + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 miles
- Lynn's miles = Reggie's miles - 3 miles = 24 - 3 = 21 miles

### 6. Our calculations seem correct, as Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran 24 miles, and Lynn ran 21 miles.

### 7. To summarize:

- Paisley ran 4 miles
- Reggie ran 5 * Paisley's miles + 3 = 24 miles
- Lynn ran Reggie's miles - 3 miles = 21 miles

### 8. Our final answer is:

- Lynn ran 21 miles

### 9. To ensure accuracy, let's verify our calculations:

- Paisley's miles = 4
- Reggie's miles = 5 * 4 + 3 = 24
- Lynn's miles = Reggie's miles - 3 = 21

Find the price of one apple and one orange.
- The cost of four apples is $5.20.
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.
- The cost of three oranges is $3.30.
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

### Step 2:
Calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

- Howie gets 2 cupcakes.
- His teacher gets 2 cupcakes.
- Each classmate gets 2 cupcakes.

- Howie and his teacher: 2 + 2 = 4
- Classmates: 25 × 2 = 50
- Total cupcakes: 4 + 50 = 54

### Step 3:
Since Howie can only buy cupcakes in batches of 12 (assuming a bakery sells cupcakes in dozens), determine how many dozens he needs to buy.
- Total cupcakes: 54
- Number of dozens: 54 ÷ 12 = 4.5
- Round up to the nearest whole number: 5 dozens

### Step 4:
Calculate the number of individual cupcakes in each dozen.
- Number of cupcakes in a dozen: 12

### Step 5:
Determine the total number of individual cupcakes Howie needs to buy.
- Number of individual cupcakes: Total cupcakes × Number of cupcakes per dozen⁻¹
- Number of individual cupcakes: 54 × (1 ÷ 12) = 54 ÷ 11 ≈ 4.9
- Round up to the nearest whole number: 5 × 12 = 60

List the items purchased and their respective prices.
- 2 bags of chips: $2.00 each
- Bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- Bottle of soda: $1.00

### Step 2:
Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.

## Solution Breakdown

1. We know that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day.
2. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C.
3. To find out how many newspapers he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers.

## Calculation Steps

1. Find the total number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C: 198 (District A) + 209 (District C) = 407 newspapers.
2. Subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers James delivers: 600 (total) - 407 (District A and District C) = 193 newspapers.
3. Since we know that James delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C, the remaining newspapers must be delivered to District B.

## Final Result

#### James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

687," ### Step 1: Identify the variables
- Let's denote the age of one twin as `Twin_A` and the other twin as `Twin_B`.
- Let's denote the age of one triplet as `Triplet_A` and the other two triplets as `Triplet_B1` and `Triplet_B2`.

### Step 2: Determine the age difference between one twin and one triplet
- We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- So, `Twin_A = Triplet_A + 7`.

### Step 3: Find the sum of all their ages
- The problem states that their combined ages are 44.
- `Twin_A + Triplet_A + Triplet_B1 + Triplet_B2 = 44`.

### Step 4: Solve the equation for `Triplet_A`
- Subtract `Twin_A` and 2*`Triplet_B1` from both sides of the equation.
- `Triplet_A + Triplet_B1 + Triplet_B2 = 44 - Twin_A - 2*Triplet_B1`.

### Step 5: Use the fact that `Triplet_B1` and `Triplet_B2` are twins
- Since `Triplet_B1` and `Triplet_B2` are twins, their ages are equal.
- Let's denote their age as `Triplet_B`.

### Step 6: Simplify the equation
- Substitute `Triplet_B` for `Triplet_B1` and `Triplet_B2` in the equation.
- `Triplet_A + 2*Triplet_B = 44 - Twin_A - 2*Triplet_B`.

### Step 7: Solve for `Triplet_A`
- Subtract `2*Triplet_B` from both sides of the equation.
- `Triplet_A = 44 - Twin_A - 2*Triplet_B + 2*Triplet_B`.
- `Triplet_A = 44 - Twin_A`.

### Step 8: Use the fact that `Triplet_A` is younger than `Twin_A`
- Since `Twin_A` is 7 years older than `Triplet_A`, `Twin_A > Triplet_A`.
- `Triplet_A = 44 - Twin_A - 7`.
- `Triplet_A = 44 - Twin_A - 7 = 37 - Twin_A`.

### Step 9: Find `Twin_A`
- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation for `Triplet_A`.
- `37 - Twin_A = Triplet_A`.
- `37 - Twin_A = 37 - Triplet_A`.
- `Twin_A = Triplet_A + 7`.

### Step 10: Find `Twin_A`
- Substitute `Triplet_A = 44 - Twin_A` from Step 8 into the equation.
- `Twin_A = Triplet_A + 7 = (44 - Twin_A) + 7`.
- `Twin_A = 51 - Twin_A`.
- `2*Twin_A = 51`.
- `Twin_A = 25.5`.
- Since ages are in whole numbers, `Twin_A` must be 26 years old.

Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- So, each male ate 4 dumplings (3 for each female + 1 more).

### Step 3:
Calculate the total number of dumplings for females.
- There are 6 females in the group.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- So, there were 18 dumplings for females (6 * 3).

### Step 4:
Calculate the total number of dumplings for males.
- There are 8 males in the group, including Larry.
- Each male ate 4 dumplings.
- So, there were 32 dumplings for males (8 * 4).

### Step 5:
Calculate the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.
- The total number of dumplings for females and males should be equal, as there were no leftovers.
- So, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings for females and males.

### Step 6:
Calculate the total number of dumplings.
- Total number of dumplings = Dumplings for females + Dumplings for males
- Total number of dumplings = 18 (females) + 32 (males)
- Total number of dumplings = 50

### Step 7:
Check if the calculated total number of dumplings is correct.
- The total number of dumplings should be equal to the sum of the dumplings for females and males.
- The total number of dumplings should be a multiple of the number of people in the group (14).

### Step 8:
Adjust the total number of dumplings if necessary.
- If the calculated total number of dumplings is not a multiple of the number of people in the group, adjust the number of dumplings for one person (male or female) until the total number of dumplings is a multiple of the number of people in the group.

### Step 9:
Calculate the adjusted total number of dumplings.
- Adjusted total number of dumplings = Total number of dumplings / Number of people in the group
- Adjusted total number of dumplings = 50 / 14
- Adjusted total number of dumplings ≈ 3.5714 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)

## Calculation Steps

1. Determine the number of days in two weeks.
   - Two weeks is equal to 14 days (7 days per week).

2. Calculate the number of candies Ginger eats in two weeks.
   - Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
   - Two weeks have 14 days.
   - So, Ginger eats 14 * 4 = <<14*4>>56 pieces of candy in two weeks.

3. Calculate the number of candies Amy eats in two weeks.
   - Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
   - Two weeks have 14 days.
   - So, Amy eats 14 * 3 = <<14*3>>42 pieces of candy in two weeks.

4. Determine the difference in the amount of candy between Ginger and Amy after two weeks.
   - The difference is the number of candies Amy has more than Ginger.
   - So, the difference = Amy's candy - Ginger's candy.

5. Subtract the number of candies Ginger ate from the number of candies Amy ate.
   - The difference = 42 (Amy's candy) - 56 (Ginger's candy).

6. Calculate the difference.
   - The difference = 42 - 56 = -14.

7. Since a negative difference doesn't make sense in this context, we need to consider that Ginger ate fewer candies than Amy.

8. Change the sign of the difference to make it positive.
   - The difference = -14 * (-1) = 14.

9. The answer represents the number of candies Amy has more than Ginger after two weeks.

10. State the final result.

**Step 2** Determine the number of tiles required to cover the calculated area:
```
Number of tiles = Area to be tiled / Tiles per square foot
Number of tiles = 22.67 sq ft / 1 sq ft/24 mosaic tiles
Number of tiles = 94.38 / 24

### 1. Determine how many pieces of gum Parker uses in a day.
- Parker chews 4 pieces of gum daily.

### 2. Calculate how many pieces of gum Parker uses in 30 days.
- Multiply the number of pieces used daily by the number of days.
- 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

### 3. Determine how many packs of gum Parker needs for 120 pieces.
- Each pack contains 15 pieces.
- Divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack.
- 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

### 4. Check if 8 packs are enough for 30 days.
- Multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack.
- 8 packs * 15 pieces/pack = 120 pieces
- Since Parker uses exactly 120 pieces in 30 days, 8 packs are enough.

### 5. Final result:
- Parker needs to buy 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

## Step 1: Identify the number of students who like to play music
The number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, we need to find the number of students who like to play basketball first.

## Step 2: Find the number of students who like to play basketball
There are 50 students in total, and 10 of them like to bake. So, there are 40 students left, and among them, 5 like to play basketball.

## Step 3: Find the number of students who like to play video games
We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since there are 5 students who like to play basketball, there must be 10 students who like to play music (2 * 5).

## Step 4: Calculate the number of students who like to play video games
Since there are 40 students left, and 10 of them like to play music, there must be 30 students who like to play video games (50 - 10 - 5).

### Step 1:
Determine the size of each group. To have equal-sized groups, we need to find the quotient of the total number of students by the desired number of groups.

### Step 2:
Calculate the number of students per group for six groups.
- Total students: 54
- Number of groups: 6

### Step 3:
Divide the total number of students by the number of groups.
- Students per group: 54 / 6 ≈ 9.0

### Step 4:
Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round up to ensure all students are included in a group.

### Step 5:
Determine the actual number of students per group.
- Students per group: 10

### Step 6:
Calculate the total number of students in six groups.
- Total students in six groups: 6 * 10 = 60

### Step 7:
Compare the total number of students in six groups with the actual number of students.
- Total students: 54
- Total students in six groups: 60

### Step 8:
Find the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students in six groups.
- Difference: 60 - 54 = 6

### Step 9:
Determine the number of groups required for twelve groups.
- Total students: 54
- Students per group: 10

### Step 10:
Calculate the number of groups needed for twelve groups.
- Number of groups: 54 / 10 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7

<3.> The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes cast is 33.
<4.> The number of valid votes (votes for or against) is equal to the total number of people multiplied by the quorum percentage (assuming a quorum was met). Since no quorum percentage was given in the problem, we'll assume 100% quorum.

- Let's denote the total number of puppies as P.
- Two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, so the number of Pomeranians is 2/3 * P.

### Step 2:
- One third of the Pomeranians are girls, so the number of Pomeranian girls is 1/3 * (2/3 * P).

### Step 3:
- We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we have the equation: 1/3 * (2/3 * P) = 6.

### Step 4:
- To solve for P, we first find the value of 2/3 * P: 2/3 * P = 3 * 6 = 18.
- Then, we find the value of P: P = 18 / (2/3) = 27.

First, let's determine how many cases of shingles the second house will need. Since the first house needs half the amount of the second house, we can represent this relationship as:

First house = 1/2 * Second house

### Step 2:
We know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second house's shingle requirement, and the three houses in total will need 250 cases. So, we can set up the following equation:

1/2 * Second house + First house + Third house = 250

### Step 3:
Since the first house needs half the shingles of the second house, we can represent the first house's shingle requirement as:

First house = 1/2 * Second house

### Step 4:
Substitute the expression for the first house into the original equation:

1/2 * Second house + Second house + Third house = 250

### Step 5:
Combine like terms:

3/2 * Second house + Third house = 250

### Step 6:
To find the shingle requirement for the third house, we need to isolate the term for the third house. First, subtract 3/2 * Second house from both sides of the equation:

Third house = 250 - 3/2 * Second house

### Step 7:
Now, we need to find the value of Second house. Since we know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second house's shingle requirement, and the first house needs 250 / 2 = 125 cases, we can set up the following equation:

1/2 * Second house = 125

### Step 8:
Solve for Second house:

Second house = 125 * 2 = 250

### Step 9:
Now, we can find the shingle requirement for the third house by substituting the value of Second house into the equation from Step 6:

Third house = 250 - 3/2 * 250

### Step 10:
Calculate the value of Third house:

Third house = 250 - 3/2 * 250 = 250 - 375 = -125

However, this result doesn't make sense since we cannot have a negative number of shingles. This indicates that there is an error in the given information, and it is not possible to determine the shingle requirement for the third house based on the provided data.

784," **Step 1.** Calculate the number of gallons Andy's car consumes per week for going to work.

- One way distance between home and office is 5 miles.
- Since Andy goes to work only from Monday to Friday, the total distance he covers in a week is 5 miles * 5 days = 25 miles.

**Step 2.** Determine the number of gallons Andy's car consumes to cover the weekly distance.

- Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG).
- To find out how many gallons he uses in a week, divide the weekly distance by his car's fuel efficiency: 25 miles / 10 MPG = 2.5 gallons.

**Step 3.** Calculate the weekly fuel cost for Andy.

- The price of regular gas is $3/gallon.
- Multiply the weekly gallon consumption by the price per gallon: 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.5.

**Step 4.** Determine the cost Andy pays per week for commuting to work.

- The weekly fuel cost is $7.5.

**Step 5.** Consider the impact of rounding.

- In real-world scenarios, fuel consumption and prices may not be exact.
- Rounding up or down could affect the final result.

**Step 6.** Account for rounding in the weekly fuel cost.

- Let's assume a rounding margin of 5 cents.
- The weekly fuel cost could be $7.5 +/- 5 cents.

First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles has in total.

- Three stuffed puppies
- Five stuffed koalas
- Two stuffed zebras
- Four stuffed frogs

### Step 2:
Calculate the number of stuffed animals Bubbles has in total.

- Total stuffed animals = 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs
- Total stuffed animals = 14

### Step 3:
Determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy such that 30% of her total collection are goats.

- Desired percentage of goats = 30%
- Total stuffed animals = 14

### Step 4:
Calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.

- Number of goats = (Desired percentage * Total stuffed animals) / 100
- Number of goats = (30 * 14) / 100
- Number of goats = 4.2 * 14
- Number of goats = 58.8

### Step 5:
Since Bubbles cannot buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, she needs to buy at least 60 stuffed goats to reach a 30% representation.

### Step 6:
Check if buying 60 stuffed goats is within Bubbles' budget.

- Bubbles currently has: 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, 4 frogs, and (future) 60 goats
- Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 60 = 64

### Step 7:
Bubbles' collection now consists of 64 stuffed animals.

### Step 8:
Calculate the percentage of stuffed goats in Bubbles' collection.

- Total stuffed animals = 64
- Number of stuffed goats = 60
- Percentage of stuffed goats = (Number of stuffed goats / Total stuffed animals) * 100
- Percentage of stuffed goats = (60 / 64) * 100
- Percentage of stuffed goats ≈ 93.75%

### Step 9:
Since the percentage of stuffed goats is more than 30%, Bubbles needs to buy fewer goats.

### Step 10:
Calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy such that the percentage of goats is exactly 30%.

- Desired percentage of goats = 30%
- Total stuffed animals = 64

### Step 11:
Calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.

- Number of goats = (Desired percentage * Total stuffed animals) / 100
- Number of goats = (30 * 64) / 100
- Number of goats = 19.2 * 64
- Number of goats = 1217.6

### Step 12:
Since Bubbles cannot buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, she needs to buy 122 stuffed goats to reach a 30% representation.

<step-2>. The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it covers a distance of 60 miles per hour * 2 hours = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.

<step-3>. The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it covers a distance of 70 miles per hour * 2 hours = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.

<step-4>. Now, we need to find the difference in their distances after 2 hours.

<step-5>. The difference in their distances is the distance covered by the second car minus the distance covered by the first car = 140 miles - 120 miles = <<140-120=20>>20 miles.

<step-6>. Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

<step-7>. It's important to note that this calculation assumes both cars maintain their constant speeds and travel in a straight line without any obstacles or external factors affecting their progress.

<step-8>. In real-world scenarios, factors like traffic, road conditions, and varying speeds can impact the actual distance between the cars.

- There are 4 students who drank 1.5 quarts each.
- The total tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

### 2. Next, let's find out how many quarts of tea were consumed by the students who drank 2 quarts each.
- There are 16 students who drank 2 quarts each.
- The total tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

### 3. Now, let's find the total tea consumed by all students.

### 4. We know that there are 2 quarts in one gallon. So, let's convert the consumed tea from quarts to gallons.
- The total tea consumed in gallons is 38 quarts / 2 quarts/gallon = 19 gallons.

### 5. Since there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party, we can find out how many gallons were at the beginning of the party by adding the consumed tea to the remaining tea.
- The total tea at the beginning of the party in quarts is 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts.

- Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Two friends play for half the time Jack does, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter.
- One friend plays for 1.5 times the length Jack does, so they play for 30 minutes per quarter.

**Step 2** Calculate the total playtime for all four friends in 4 hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 240 minutes.
- Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter, so he plays for 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12 quarters in 4 hours.
- Two friends play for 10 minutes per quarter, so they play for 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 quarters in 4 hours.
- One friend plays for 30 minutes per quarter, so they play for 12 quarters in 4 hours.
- In total, they play for 12 + 24 + 12 = <<12+24+12=48>>48 quarters in 4 hours.

**Step 3** Determine how much money is used by each friend.
- Jack pays 1 quarter per 20 minutes.
- Two friends pay 1 quarter per 10 minutes.
- One friend pays 1 quarter per 30 minutes.

**Step 4** Calculate the total amount of money spent by each friend.
- Jack spends 1 quarter every 20 minutes, so he spends 1 / (20 / 60) = <<1/(20/60)=0.125>>0.125 quarters per minute. In 4 hours, he spends 0.125 * 240 = <<0.125*240=30>>30 quarters.
- Two friends spend 1 quarter every 10 minutes, so they spend 1 / (10 / 60) = <<1/(10/60)=0.25>>0.25 quarters per minute. In 4 hours, they spend 0.25 * 240 = <<0.25*240=60>>60 quarters.
- One friend spends 1 quarter every 30 minutes, so they spend 1 / (30 / 60) = <<1/(30/60)=0.5>>0.5 quarters per minute. In 4 hours, they spend 0.5 * 240 = <<0.5*240=120>>120 quarters.

**Step 5** Add up the total amount of money spent by all friends.
- Jack spends 30 quarters.
- Two friends spend 60 quarters.
- One friend spends 120 quarters.
- In total, they spend 30 + 60 + 120 = <<30+60+120=210>>210 quarters or 1 dollar and 10 cents (since there are 100 quarters in a dollar).

**Step 4**: Since Julie scored more points than Sasha in the second game, we know that Julie scored more than 10 points in the second game. Let's assume Julie scored Y points in the second game.

Becca has `12 + Smendrick's cards` = `12 + 3x` cards.

### Step 4:

## Step 1: Record Mulan's initial money
- Mulan starts with $40.

## Step 2: Record the amount her father gave her
- Her father gave her an additional $100.

## Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Mulan now has
- Mulan now has $40 (her initial money) + $100 (her father's gift) = $140.

## Step 4: Record the cost of two pairs of jeans
- Each pair of jeans costs $30.
- Mulan buys two pairs, so the total cost is $30 * 2 = $60.

## Step 5: Record the cost of the bag
- The bag costs $20.

## Step 6: Calculate the total amount Mulan spent on jeans and the bag
- Mulan spent $60 on jeans and $20 on the bag, so she spent a total of $60 + $20 = $80.

## Step 7: Calculate the amount of money Mulan has left
- Mulan started with $140, spent $80 on jeans and a bag, so she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.

## Step 8: Check if the calculation is correct
- We can verify that the calculation is correct by checking that the initial amount, the father's gift, the cost of jeans and the bag, and the final amount all add up: $40 (initial) + $100 (father's gift) = $140; $140 - $80 (jeans and bag) = $60.

## Step 9: State the final result
- The answer is: Mulan has $60 left.

- Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.
- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.
- Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

### Step 2: Determine the height difference between the mountains lifted by each character
- Let's denote the height of the mountain Pompei can lift as 1 inch (1 unit).
- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher, so the height of the mountain Saskay can lift is 12 inches (1 unit * 12).
- Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times lower than Saskay, so the height of the mountain Kagiyami can lift is 1 unit / 4 = 0.25 units.
- Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so the height of the mountain Naruto can lift is 10 * 0.25 = 2.5 units.

### Step 3: Convert units to a common unit (feet)
- 1 inch is equal to approximately 0.0254 feet.
- The height of the mountain Pompei can lift is 1 inch = 0.0254 feet.

- It takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.

##### Step 1. Determine the travel time for one kangaroo.
- Since there are 3 kangaroos, and they all take 18 hours to cross the highway, the travel time for one kangaroo is 18 hours / 3 = 6 hours.

##### Step 2. Determine the speed of one kangaroo.
- We don't have the speed of a single kangaroo given, but we can calculate it based on the travel time. The speed of a kangaroo is the distance traveled divided by the time taken. Since the problem doesn't provide the distance, we cannot calculate the speed of a kangaroo.

##### Step 3. Determine the travel time for one turtle.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

##### Step 4. Calculate the travel time for one turtle based on the kangaroo's travel time.
- Since the turtle's speed is half that of a kangaroo, it will take twice as long to travel the same distance.
- Travel time for one turtle = Travel time for one kangaroo * 2

##### Step 5. Since we don't have the distance, we cannot directly calculate the travel time for four turtles.

##### Step 6. However, we can calculate the travel time for one turtle and then use that to find the travel time for four turtles if we know the total travel time for all four turtles.

##### Step 7. If we assume that the total travel time for four turtles is 18 hours (the same as for three kangaroos), we can find the travel time for one turtle using Step 4.

##### Step 8. Travel time for one turtle = 18 hours / 4 = 4.5 hours.

##### Step 9. Since we cannot directly calculate the travel time for one turtle without knowing the distance, our final answer is an approximation based on the assumption that the total travel time for four turtles is the same as for three kangaroos.

##### Step 10. Approximate travel time for four turtles = 4 * 4.5 hours = 18 hours.

: Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

<step-3>. Calculate how many packs are needed to provide 2 glue sticks for each student, with no extra glue sticks.
: The class needs 54 glue sticks, and each pack contains 8 glue sticks, so the number of packs needed is 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs. Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

<step-4>. Determine how many extra glue sticks Mr. Jackson will have.
: Mr. Jackson bought 7 packs, which contain a total of 7 packs * 8 glue sticks per pack = 56 glue sticks. Since the class needed 54 glue sticks, Mr. Jackson has 56 glue sticks / 54 glue sticks needed per student = 1.04 extra glue sticks per student, or a total of 1.04 * 27 students = 28.34 extra glue sticks. Since Mr. Jackson can't have a fraction of a glue stick, he will have 29 extra glue sticks.

<step-5>. State the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy.
: Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks.

### Step 2:
Fawn has `a + 12` books, as stated in the problem.

### Step 3:
The total number of books they have is 85. So, we can set up the following equation:

```
a + (a + 25) + (a + 12) = 85

### Step 6:
Divide both sides by 3:

### Step 7:
Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has:

- Sarah's rope is 20 meters long.
- The cost is $2 per meter.
- Total cost = Length * Cost per meter
- Total cost = 20 * $2
- Total cost = $40

**Step 2** Calculate the cost of the new rope Sarah intends to buy.
- The length of the new rope is not provided.
- The cost is $1.5 per meter.

**Step 3** Calculate the cost of the new rope based on the given information.
- Let's assume Sarah wants to buy a new rope of the same length as the old one (20 meters).
- Cost of new rope = Length * Cost per meter
- Cost of new rope = 20 * $1.5
- Cost of new rope = $30

**Step 4** Calculate the total cost of both ropes.
- Cost of old rope = $40
- Cost of new rope = $30
- Total cost = Cost of old rope + Cost of new rope
- Total cost = $40 + $30
- Total cost = $70

**Step 5** Calculate the profit Sarah made from selling the old rope.
- Cost of old rope = $40
- Sarah sold the old rope for $40.
- Profit = Cost of selling - Cost of buying
- Profit = $40 - $40
- Profit = $0

**Step 2.** Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars to find out how many cookies are in each jar.

```
50 (cookies left) / 5 (jars) = 10 (cookies per jar)
```

**Step 3.** However, since Lani ate 5 cookies, there should be 51 cookies in total. So, we need to add those 5 cookies back to the count.

```
50 (cookies left) + 5 (cookies eaten) = 55 (total cookies)
```

**Step 4.** Now, we can calculate the number of cookies in each jar again, taking into account the 5 cookies Lani ate.

```
55 (total cookies) / 5 (jars) = 11 (cookies per jar)
```

**Step 5.** Since there cannot be a fraction of a cookie in each jar, we need to find out how many cookies make up that fraction.

First, let's find the relationship between the whirligig and the thingamabob's spinning speeds. We know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.

### Step 2:
Next, let's find the relationship between the whatchamacallit and the thingamabob's spinning speeds. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.

### Step 3:
Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, we can determine the ratio of their spinning speeds by multiplying these factors:

- Ratio of whirligig to thingamabob = 5
- Ratio of whatchamacallit to thingamabob = 11
- Ratio of whirligig to whatchamacallit = 5 / 11

### Step 4:
We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Using this information, we can find the spinning speed of the thingamabob by dividing the whatchamacallit's speed by the ratio of whatchamacallit to thingamabob:

- Thingamabob's speed = Whatchamacallit's speed / Ratio of whatchamacallit to thingamabob
- Thingamabob's speed = 121 m/s / 11
- Thingamabob's speed ≈ 11 m/s

### Step 5:
Now that we know the thingamabob spins at approximately 11 m/s, we can find the whirligig's spinning speed by multiplying the thingamabob's speed by the ratio of whirligig to thingamabob:

- Whirligig's speed = Thingamabob's speed * Ratio of whirligig to thingamabob
- Whirligig's speed = 11 m/s * 5/11
- Whirligig's speed ≈ 5.5 m/s

### Step 6:
Since the problem does not provide a specific unit for the spinning speeds, we cannot determine the exact units for the whirligig's spinning speed. However, we can express it as a multiple of the thingamabob's speed.

### Step 7:
To summarize, the whirligig spins at a speed approximately 5.5 times faster than the thingamabob's spinning speed.

**Step 2.** She needs 0.5 yards of material for each small mask. To make 20 small masks, she requires 20 * 0.5 = **10 yards** of material.

**Step 3.** Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, the material required for one large mask is 0.75 yards.

**Step 4.** She needs 0.75 yards of material for each large mask. To make 8 large masks, she requires 8 * 0.75 = **6 yards** of material.

**Step 5.** To make both small and large masks for her class, she requires the material for 20 small masks (10 yards) and 8 large masks (6 yards).

**Step 6.** In total, she needs 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = **16 yards** of material.

**Step 7.** Since Jo can only work with full yards of material, she would need to round up her total requirement to the nearest yard.

**Step 8.** Therefore, she would need 16 + 1 = **17 yards** of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.

### 1. Number of Movies Watched
- Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre a total of 3 times.
- So, she has watched a total of 9 movies * 3 times = 27 times.

### 2. Total Cost of Tickets
- Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these movie tickets.

### 3. Average Price of a Single Ticket
- To find the average price of a single ticket, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of tickets purchased.
- The total number of tickets purchased is equal to the number of movies watched, as each movie watching session results in one ticket being purchased.
- So, the average price of a single ticket is $216 / 27 = $7.67 approximately.

Final result: The average price Deepa paid per ticket for the Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre is approximately $7.67.

- Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
- Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he works for 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours a day.

## Step 3: Determine the number of hours Harold spends walking his dog.
- Harold walks his dog for an hour each day.

## Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours Harold spends on sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make one round trip (down to the ground and back up into the tree) to collect berries.
- In 8 hours, the sloth wants to collect 24 berries.

**Step 2** Calculate the number of round trips the sloth makes in 8 hours.
- The sloth spends 4 hours making one round trip.
- In 8 hours, the sloth wants to make `8 hours / 4 hours/trip = 2 trips/hour * 8 hours = 16 trips`.

**Step 3** Determine the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip.
- In 8 hours, the sloth wants to collect 24 berries.
- Since the sloth makes 16 trips in 8 hours, the number of berries picked up per trip is `24 berries / 16 trips = 1.5 berries/trip`.

**Step 4** Since a sloth cannot pick up half a berry, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is rounded up to the nearest whole number.

**Step 5** Calculate the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip.

Determine the amount of water Anthony and his father take from the pool. Since they take half of the pool's water, the amount is:

```
5000 gallons
```

### Step 2:
Find out how much water is left in the pool after Anthony and his father take their share.

```
10000 gallons (initial pool water) - 5000 gallons (water taken) = 5000 gallons
```

### Step 3:
Calculate how much water is used from the tank for watering the garden each day.

```
500 gallons/day

### Step 4:
Determine how much water is used from the tank in 6 days.

```
500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons
```

### Step 5:
Subtract the water used from the initial amount left in the tank.

```
5000 gallons (initial water in the tank) - 3000 gallons (water used) = 2000 gallons

- Subtract the cost of tickets Colby already bought: 5 Fridays or Saturdays * $10 + 8 other days * $7 = $110
- Subtract the cost of popcorn and candy Colby already bought: 2 tubs of popcorn * $8 + 4 boxes of candy * $2 = $18
- Colby has $122 left for movies.

**Step 2.** Determine how many movies Colby can see with the remaining money.

- Calculate the cost of one movie with popcorn and a box of candy: $10 (movie ticket) + $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $20
- Divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie: $122 / $20 = 6.1 movies
- Since Colby can't see a fraction of a movie, he can see 6 movies.

**Step 3.** Check if Colby can afford seeing 6 movies on Fridays or Saturdays.

- Calculate the cost of 6 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 6 * $10 = $60

Cameron checks in at 5 pm and checks out at 10 am the next morning. The difference between these two times is 19 hours (19 hours = 10 am - 5 pm).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of a 12-hour stay
The cost of a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the extra hours
The cost of each additional hour is 70 pesos. Since Cameron stays for 19 hours in total, the cost of the extra hours is 19 hours * 70 pesos = \boxed{1330} pesos.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of a 24-hour stay
The cost of a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours
The total cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours is the cost of a 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) plus the cost of the extra hours (1330 pesos) = 1000 pesos + 1330 pesos = \boxed{2330} pesos.

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost if Cameron pays hourly
The total cost if Cameron pays hourly is the cost of the 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) plus the cost of the extra hours (19 hours * 70 pesos) = 1000 pesos + 1330 pesos = \boxed{2330} pesos.

<step-3>. The time it takes James to swim 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.
<step-4>. After swimming for 6 hours, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.
<step-5>. In total, James spends 6 hours swimming and 3 hours resting, so he spends a total of 6 + 3 = 9 hours on the water.

<step-7>. He swims this distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
<step-8>. The time it takes James to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

## Solution Breakdown

1. We know that each inch of the book contains 100 pages.
2. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
3. Since each page is printed on both sides, we have to count each page twice to get the total number of pages.
4. To find the total number of pages, multiply the number of inches by the number of pages per inch and then double that value.
5. First, calculate the number of pages in one inch: 1 inch * 100 pages/inch = 100 pages.
6. Next, calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches: 1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages.
7. Since each page is counted twice, we need to divide the result by 2 to get the actual number of pages in the book.
8. Therefore, the number of pages in the book is: 150 pages / 2 = 75 pages.

## Final Result
#### The book has 75 pages.

## Calculation of Reports Stapled by Vince

1. Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
2. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he can staple 30 * 4 reports in an hour.
3. There are 2 hours in a half-day (8:00 AM to 12:00 PM), so Vince can staple 30 * 4 * 2 = <<30*4*2=120>>120 reports in a half-day.
4. There are 3 half-days in a regular workday (8:00 AM to 11:00 PM), so Vince can staple 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 reports in a workday.
5. There are 7 days in a week, so Vince can staple 360 * 7 = <<360*7=2520>>2520 reports in a week.
6. There are 4 weeks in a month (approximately), so Vince can staple 2520 * 4 = <<2520*4=10080>>10,080 reports in a month.
7. There are 12 months in a year, so Vince can staple 10,080 * 12 = <<10080*12=120960>>120,960 reports in a year.
8. To find the total number of reports stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to calculate the number of hours between these two times and find out how many days this corresponds to.
9. There are 24 hours in a day, so the difference between 11:00 PM and 8:00 AM is 11 - 8 = 3 hours.
10. Since Vince works for 15 hours a day (from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM), the number of days he works in a year is 15 * 7 = <<15*7=105>>105 days.

## Final Result

955," **Step 1: Determine the current number of occupied beds**
Currently, 1/5 of the hospital's capacity is occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:

```
Occupied beds = Capacity * (Number of occupied beds / Total beds)
Occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5)
Occupied beds = 1000 * 0.2
Occupied beds = 200
```

**Step 2: Calculate the number of new beds occupied each day**
50 new patients are admitted into the hospital each day. So, the number of new occupied beds each day is:

```
New occupied beds per day = New patients per day
New occupied beds per day = 50
```

**Step 3: Determine the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**
In 2 weeks, there will be an additional 10 days (since there are 7 days in a week). So, the total number of new occupied beds in 2 weeks is:

```
Total new occupied beds in 2 weeks = New occupied beds per day * Number of days
Total new occupied beds in 2 weeks = 50 * 10
Total new occupied beds in 2 weeks = 500
```

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**
The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the sum of the current number of occupied beds and the new occupied beds in 2 weeks:

```
Total occupied beds = Occupied beds + Total new occupied beds in 2 weeks
Total occupied beds = 200 + 500
Total occupied beds = 700
```

**Step 5: Determine the number of unoccupied beds**
The number of unoccupied beds is the difference between the total number of beds and the total number of occupied beds:

```
Unoccupied beds = Total beds - Total occupied beds
Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 700
Unoccupied beds = 300
```

**Step 6: Check if the calculation is reasonable**
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and currently, 200 beds are occupied. In 2 weeks, 50 new patients are admitted each day, which is an additional 500 beds. So, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 700, leaving 300 unoccupied beds.

**Step 7: Consider potential limitations**
This calculation assumes that the hospital's capacity remains constant and that all new patients can be accommodated in the hospital. In reality, there may be limitations to the hospital's capacity due to factors such as staffing, equipment, and space.

**Step 8: Consider the impact of the coronavirus outbreak**
The coronavirus outbreak may lead to an increase in the number of patients requiring hospitalization, which could exceed the hospital's capacity. In such cases, the hospital may need to expand its capacity by setting up temporary facilities or redirecting patients to other hospitals.

**Step 9: Consider the importance of effective resource management**
Effective resource management is crucial during the coronavirus outbreak to ensure that hospitals have the necessary beds, staff, and equipment to care for patients. This may involve prioritizing patients based on the severity of their condition, implementing triage systems, and coordinating with other hospitals to manage patient flow.

**Step 10: Consider the role of public health measures**
Public health measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing good hand hygiene can help reduce the spread of the coronavirus and prevent the need for unnecessary hospitalizations. This can help ensure that hospitals have the capacity to care for patients who require critical care.

3. A + S + F = 339

**Step 3** Solve the system of equations:

2. Combine like terms: 2S + 5 + F = 339
3. Subtract 5 from both sides: 2S + F = 334
4. Since F is less than S (as Stan catches more Pokemon than Adelwolfe), we can assume that F is a small number. Let's try F = 33: 2S + 33 = 334

- Andy has 3 racquets to be strung with synthetic gut.
- It takes him an average of 15 minutes to string a racquet with synthetic gut.
- Time for synthetic gut stringing = Number of racquets * Time per racquet

### Step 2: Calculate the time for stringing racquets with polyester string.
- Andy has 5 racquets to be strung with polyester string.
- It takes him an average of 22 minutes to string a racquet with polyester string.
- Time for polyester stringing = Number of racquets * Time per racquet

### Step 3: Calculate the time for stringing racquets with hybrid sets.
- Andy has 4 racquets to be strung with hybrid sets.
- Each hybrid set takes him an average of 18 minutes to string.

## Solution to find the number of players in both teams combined

1. We know that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team.
2. Carlton's team has 13 players.
3. To find the number of players in Zeke's team, we add 7 to the number of players in Carlton's team.
4. Players in Zeke's team = Players in Carlton's team + 7
5. Players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7
6. Players in Zeke's team = 20
7. Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in each team.
8. Total number of players = Players in Zeke's team + Players in Carlton's team
9. Total number of players = 20 + 13
10. Total number of players = 33

## The answer is:
There are 33 players in both Zeke's and Carlton's baseball teams combined.

## Calculation of Wooden Slats Needed

1. First, we need to find the total length and width of the fence in feet. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.
2. Next, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle to determine how many slats are needed for the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width).
3. Applying the formula, we get a perimeter of 2*(15 + 10) = 2*(25) = 50 feet.
4. Since Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the total length of fencing by 2 to find the number of slats required.
5. Therefore, the number of slats needed is 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.
6. It's important to note that this calculation assumes that each corner requires only 1 additional slat for the intersection. If Robert wants to use a more robust corner design that requires 2 additional slats per corner, the total number of slats needed would be 100 + 4 = 104.
7. Another consideration is the gate, if there is one, which may require additional slats. The number of slats needed for a gate would depend on its size and design.
8. It's also important to consider any waste or damage that may occur during the construction process, which may require additional slats to be on hand.
9. Additionally, Robert may want to have some extra slats for future repairs or modifications to the fence.
10. Finally, it's a good idea for Robert to order a few extra slats to ensure that he has enough material for the project.

- Initially, she had 12 * 20 = **240** oranges.

**Step 2** She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- She gave away 2 * 20 = **40** oranges.
- After giving away oranges, she had 240 - 40 = **200** oranges.

**Step 3** She kept 1/4 of the oranges.
- She kept 1/4 * 200 = **50** boxes of oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges, so she kept 50 * 20 = **1000** oranges.
- After keeping oranges, she had 200 - 1000 = **-800** oranges. This result is not possible, so we made an error in our calculation.

**Step 4** Correction: She kept 1/4 of the boxes, not the oranges.
- She kept 1/4 * 12 = **3** boxes of oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges, so she kept 3 * 20 = **60** oranges.
- After keeping oranges, she had 240 - 60 = **180** oranges.

**Step 5** She sold the rest of the oranges.
- She sold 240 - 180 = **60** boxes of oranges.

- The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low.
- The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high.
- The room warms up 2 degrees an hour without the air conditioner.

**Step 2: Calculate the total temperature change during each mode**
- The air conditioner was on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.
- The air conditioner was on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 4 * 3 = 12 degrees.
- The room warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

**Step 3: Calculate the net temperature change**
- The net temperature change is the total cooling minus the total warming.
- Net temperature change = 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) - 4 degrees (no AC)

**Step 4: Calculate the final temperature**
- The starting temperature is not given, so we cannot calculate the final temperature directly.
- However, we can calculate the number of degrees below the starting temperature the final temperature is.

**Step 5: Calculate the temperature change during the last 2 hours without the air conditioner**
- The room warms up 2 degrees an hour without the air conditioner.
- During the last 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees.

**Step 6: Calculate the net temperature change during the entire period**
- Net temperature change during the entire period = net temperature change during AC use - temperature change during no AC use
- Net temperature change during the entire period = 6 degrees + 12 degrees - 4 degrees = 12 degrees

**Step 7: Calculate the final temperature relative to the starting temperature**
- The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the net temperature change.

- Therefore, the age difference between Bill's father's age at the first sighting and Bill's age at the second sighting is equal to one orbit of Comet Halley.

**Step 4** Calculate the age difference between Bill's father's age at the first sighting and Bill's age at the second sighting.
- Age difference = X - Y
- Substitute X = 3Y into the equation: 3Y - Y = Age difference
- Simplify the equation: 2Y = Age difference

**Step 5** Find the value of Y, Bill's father's age at the first sighting.
- Divide both sides of the equation by 2: Y = Age difference / 2

**Step 6** Substitute the given information into the equation.
- Age difference = 75 years (one orbit of Comet Halley)

**Step 7** Calculate the value of Y.
- Y = 75 years / 2
- Y = 37.5 years

**Step 8** Since a person's age is always a whole number, we cannot have a fractional age. Therefore, we need to find the closest whole number to 37.5 years that is less than 38 years (since Bill is older than his father during the second sighting).

**Step 9** Determine the closest whole number to 37.5 years that is less than 38 years.
- The closest whole number to 37.5 years that is less than 38 years is 35.

**Step 10** Find Bill's father's age at the first sighting.
- Y = 35 years

**Step 11** Calculate Bill's age at the first sighting.
- Bill's age at the first sighting = Y + Age difference between Bill and his father
- Bill's age at the first sighting = 35 years + 75 years
- Bill's age at the first sighting = 110 years

**The answer is:** Bill's father saw the Comet Halley when he was 35 years old, and Bill saw it for the first time when he was 110 years old.",0,False,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints9MathFormat'}

- Each adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice.
- So, one adult's slice is equal to 2 units.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of slices for the family
- There are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family.

<4.> The total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds and appointments is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.
<5.> Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so the time he has left to update his records is 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

### 2. Let's assume that a full box contains x chocolate bars. Then, half a box would contain x/2 chocolate bars.

### 3. We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and each box contains x chocolate bars, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars in total.

### 4. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars in total.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total number of chocolate bars for Peter is 64, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

- Number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter: 64 / 4 = 16

**Step 2: Find the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha**
Since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total number of chocolate bars for Martha is 56, we can find the number of chocolate bars in each box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

- Number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha: 56 / 7 ≈ 8.0, but since there cannot be a fraction of a chocolate bar, we'll round down to 8

**Step 3: Determine the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box**

- Difference in the number of chocolate bars per box: 16 (Peter) - 8 (Martha) = 8

**Step 4: Confirm the calculation**
We can also confirm the calculation by finding the total number of chocolate bars for each person and subtracting the total number of boxes for each person from that total.

- Total number of chocolate bars for Peter: 4 boxes * 16 chocolate bars/box = 64 chocolate bars
- Total number of chocolate bars for Martha: 7 boxes * 8 chocolate bars/box = 56 chocolate bars
- Difference in the total number of chocolate bars: 64 (Peter) - 56 (Martha) = 8 chocolate bars

**Step 5: Check the calculation**
We can check the calculation by adding the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha and comparing the sums.

- Number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter: 16
- Number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha: 8
- Sum of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha: 16 + 8 = 24
- Total number of chocolate bars for Peter: 4 boxes * 24 chocolate bars/box = 96 chocolate bars
- Total number of chocolate bars for Martha: 7 boxes * 24 chocolate bars/box = 168 chocolate bars
- Sum of total chocolate bars for Peter and Martha: 96 + 168 = 264 chocolate bars
- Difference between the total number of chocolate bars for Peter and Martha: 264 (total for Peter and Martha) - 200 (total for Martha) = 64 chocolate bars

**Step 6: Verify the calculation**
We can verify the calculation by checking that the difference in the total number of chocolate bars is equal to the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box multiplied by the number of boxes.

- Difference in the total number of chocolate bars: 64 chocolate bars
- Difference in the number of chocolate bars per box: 8 chocolate bars
- Number of boxes for Peter: 4
- Number of boxes for Martha: 7
- Difference in the number of boxes: 4
- Product of the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box and the difference in the number of boxes: 8 chocolate bars/box * 4 boxes = 32 chocolate bars
- The difference in the total number of chocolate bars should be equal to the product of the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box and the difference in the number of boxes: 64 chocolate bars = 32 chocolate bars/box * 4 boxes

**Step 3** Calculate the number of babies born by each female porcupine every month.
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.

**Step 4** Find out how many babies are born in total every month.
- Since there are 30 female porcupines, and each gives birth to 4 babies, the total number of babies born every month is 30 * 4 = 120.

1012," **Step 1** Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as `C_0`.

**Step 2** Over the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour. So, the amount of charge lost during this period is `5 * 0.09 * C_0`.

**Step 3** After the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. So, the amount of charge lost during this period is `3 * 0.07 * C_0`.

**Step 4** The total charge lost during the entire 8 hours is the sum of the charge lost during the first 5 hours and the charge lost during the last 3 hours.

**Step 5** Therefore, the total charge lost is `5 * 0.09 * C_0 + 3 * 0.07 * C_0`.

**Step 6** The final charge of the power bank is the initial charge minus the total charge lost.

**Step 7** We know that the final charge is 28% of the initial charge, so `0.28 * C_0 = 0.72 * C_0 - (5 * 0.09 * C_0 + 3 * 0.07 * C_0)`.

**Step 8** Solving for `C_0`: `C_0 = (0.28 * C_0) / (1 - 0.72 + 5 * 0.09 + 3 * 0.07)`.

**Step 9** Simplifying the equation: `C_0 = C_0 * (0.28 / (1 - 0.72 + 0.09 + 0.07))`.

**Step 10** Since `0.28 / (1 - 0.72 + 0.09 + 0.07)` is a fraction less than 1, the initial charge `C_0` is greater than the final charge of 28%.

**Final result:** To find the exact initial charge `C_0`, we would need to calculate the value of `0.28 / (1 - 0.72 + 0.09 + 0.07)` and then multiply it by the final charge of 28%. However, since the value is a fraction less than 1, the initial charge was more than 28%.

## Solution to the problem

1. Anne has a total of 15 packs of sweets.
2. Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces Anne has is: 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces
3. Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away: 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs
4. Each of her 10 friends received one pack, so each friend got: 1 pack/friend * 60 pieces/pack = 60 pieces
5. To find out how many pieces each friend received in total, we multiply the number of friends by the number of pieces each friend got: 10 friends * 60 pieces/friend = 600 pieces
6. However, Anne kept 2 packs for herself, which contain: 2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces
7. So the total number of pieces Anne gave away to her friends is: 600 pieces (for friends) + 120 pieces (for herself) = 720 pieces
8. To find out how many pieces each friend received in the end, we divide the total number of pieces Anne gave away by the number of friends: 720 pieces / 10 friends = 72 pieces/friend
9. However, we made an error in step 5. Each friend received one pack initially, but each pack contains 60 pieces, so each friend received 60 pieces in the beginning.
10. Therefore, the total number of pieces Anne gave away is: 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces
11. The total number of pieces Anne had was 900, so the number of pieces she kept for herself is: 900 pieces - 780 pieces = 120 pieces

## Final result:
Each friend received 120 pieces of sweets.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took `2 * ($x + $80)`.

### Step 4:
The total amount is divided among three people, so the sum of their shares is `$1920`.

### Step 5:
We can write an equation to represent the total amount: `x + (x + $80) + 2 * (x + $80) = $1920`.

### Step 6:
Simplify the equation: `3x + $240 = $1920`.

- The car was bought for $20000 in 2007.
- The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 2: Determine the annual depreciation amount
- To find the annual depreciation, multiply the initial price by the depreciation rate.
- Annual depreciation = Initial price * Depreciation rate
- Annual depreciation = $20000 * 0.21
- Annual depreciation = $4200

### Step 3: Calculate the car's value in 2008
- Subtract the annual depreciation from the initial price to find the car's value in the next year.
- Car's value in 2008 = Initial price - Annual depreciation
- Car's value in 2008 = $20000 - $4200
- Car's value in 2008 = $15780

### Step 4: Repeat the process for the remaining years
- Continue subtracting the annual depreciation from the previous year's value to find the car's value in each subsequent year.

### Step 5: Calculate the car's value in 2009
- Car's value in 2009 = Car's value in 2008 - Annual depreciation
- Car's value in 2009 = $15780 - $4200
- Car's value in 2009 = $11580

### Step 6: Calculate the car's value in 2010
- Car's value in 2010 = Car's value in 2009 - Annual depreciation
- Car's value in 2010 = $11580 - $4200
- Car's value in 2010 = $7380

### Step 7: Check the result for the year 2011
- Car's value in 2011 = Car's value in 2010 - Annual depreciation
- Car's value in 2011 = $7380 - $4200
- Car's value in 2011 = $3180

### Step 8: Verify that the depreciation rate is consistent
- The car's value in each subsequent year should be less than the previous year's value by the annual depreciation amount.

### Step 9: Find the car's value in 2012 and beyond, if needed

- Each tile covers an area of 1 ft × 1 ft = 1 sq ft.
- The kitchen floor has an area of 200 sq ft.
- Therefore, the number of tiles required is 200 sq ft ÷ 1 sq ft/tile = 200 tiles.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of tiles
- Each tile costs $12.
- The cost of 200 tiles is 200 tiles × $12/tile = $2400.

### Step 3: Consider additional costs
- There might be additional costs for grout, adhesive, and other materials.
- Let's assume an additional cost of $2 per square foot for materials and labor.
- The additional cost for the kitchen floor is 200 sq ft × $2/sq ft = $400.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
- The cost of tiles is $2400.
- The additional cost is $400.
- The total cost of renovating the kitchen floor is $2400 + $400 = $2800.

## Calculation Steps

1. First, we need to determine how many jellyfish one spring creates in one hour. Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we have:
   - Jellyfish created by one spring in 1 hour = 60 jellyfish/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour

2. Next, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs working at the same rate create in an hour:
   - Jellyfish created by 5 springs in 1 hour = 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18000 jellyfish/hour

3. To find out how many jellyfish are created in 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:
   - Jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours = 18000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72000 jellyfish

## Final result:
The five bubbling springs would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.",1,True,False,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints7MathFormat'}
1081," **Step 1** Let's denote Binkie's score as X.

**Step 2** According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. So, Frankie's score can be represented as 2 * X + 15.

**Step 3** The problem states that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. This means that the difference between their scores is 15 and the ratio of their scores is 2:1.

**Step 4** We are given that Binkie's score is 90.

**Step 5** To find Frankie's score, we need to use the given information and the relationship between their scores.

**Step 6** Let's set up an equation to represent the difference between their scores: Frankie's score - Binkie's score = 15.

**Step 7** Substitute the expressions for their scores from Step 2 into the equation: (2 * X + 15) - X = 15.

**Step 8** Simplify the equation: 2 * X + 15 - X = 15.

**Step 9** Combine like terms: X + 15 = 15.

**Step 10** Solve for X: X = 0. This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as Binkie's score cannot be zero.

**Step 11** Let's go back to the equation in Step 7 and try to find a solution for X that results in a reasonable score for both Frankie and Binkie.

**Step 12** We know that Binkie's score is 90, so we can try different values for X to find a value that results in a Frankie's score that is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.

**Step 13** By trial and error, we find that if X = 45, then Frankie's score is 2 * X + 15 = 90 + 15 = 105.

- Let's denote the height of the first child as `h1` in feet.
- Since the second child is two inches taller than the first child, the height of the second child is `h1 + 2` feet.

### Step 2:
- The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the height of the third child is `h1 + 2 - 5 = h1 + 1` feet.

### Step 3:
- The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the height of the fourth child is `h1 + 1 + 3 = h1 + 4` feet.

### Step 4:
- Since we know that the first child is 6 feet tall, we can substitute `h1 = 6` in our equation for the height of the fourth child.

### Step 5:
- Therefore, the height of the fourth child is `h1 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10` feet.

### Step 6:
- However, since we are asked for the height in inches, we need to convert the height from feet to inches.

### Step 7:
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so the height of the fourth child in inches is `10 * 12 = 120` inches.

### Step 8:
- We can check our calculation by comparing the heights of the children: the first child is 6 feet or 72 inches, the second child is 6 feet + 2 inches = 74 inches, the third child is 72 inches - 5 inches = 67 inches, and the fourth child is 74 inches + 3 inches = 77 inches.

### Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
- He takes 20% of the days off, so 31 weeks * 0.2 = 6.2 weeks.

**Step 4**: Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by using the information that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, Jeff's age is 30 years (Martha's age + 10).

**Step 5**: To summarize, Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

5. Bobby works for 5 days a week.
6. Calculate the total hours for lunch and breaks in a week:
    - Total hours per week: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
    - Total hours per week: 300 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours/week
7. However, since Bobby works for 8 hours a day, we need to subtract the hours spent on lunch and breaks from his total working hours.
8. Bobby works for 8 hours a day: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.
9. Subtract the hours spent on lunch and breaks from his total working hours: 40 hours/week - 5 hours/week = 35 hours/week.
10. The answer is: Bobby spends 5 hours a week on lunch and breaks.

So, we need to find 1/5th of the total number of jellyfish, and then find 1/3rd of that number to get the number of large jellyfish that change color.

- Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as `T`.
- The number of large jellyfish is `T/5`.
- The number of large jellyfish that change color is `(T/5) * (1/3)`.

**Step 2** Determine the number of small jellyfish. We know that the other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. So, the number of small jellyfish is the total number of jellyfish minus the number of large jellyfish.

- The number of small jellyfish is `T - (T/5)`.

**Step 3** Find the number of small jellyfish that change color when the UV light is turned on. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Since all small jellyfish are always blue, none of them change color under UV light.

- The number of small jellyfish that change color is 0.

**Step 4** Use the information about the number of large jellyfish that change color to find the total number of jellyfish. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and that number is equal to the number of large jellyfish that change color.

- The number of large jellyfish that change color is 6.
- The number of large jellyfish is `(T/5)`.
- Setting these equal to each other, we get `(T/5) = 6`.
- Solving for `T`, we get `T = 30`.

- Let's denote the age of Chris as C.
- According to the problem, Ben is two times older than Chris, so his age (B) is 2 * C.
- Caroline is three times older than Ben, so her age (CAR) is 3 * B.

### Step 2:
- Substitute the expressions for B from Step 1 into the expression for CAR.
- CAR = 3 * (2 * C)

### Step 3:
- Distribute the multiplication: CAR = 2 * 3 * C

### Step 4:
- Simplify the expression: CAR = 6 * C

### Step 5:
- We know that Chris's age is 4, so we can find the value of C.
- C = 4

### Step 6:
- Substitute the value of C back into the expression for CAR.
- CAR = 6 * 4

### Step 7:
- Multiply: CAR = 24

### Step 8:
- Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, and Ben is 2 times older than Chris, we can also say that Caroline is 6 * 2 = 12 times older than Chris.

- Lauren saves 20% of every paycheck
- Her current salary is $100,000
- To find the amount she saves per paycheck, we need to know how many paychecks she gets in a year

**Step 2** Determine the number of paychecks per year.
- Assuming Lauren gets paid biweekly, she gets 26 paychecks per year

**Step 3** Calculate the amount Lauren saves per year.
- Lauren saves 20% of every paycheck
- She gets 26 paychecks per year
- So, she saves 0.2 * $X = $X * 0.2 = $20,000 per year

**Step 4** Calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for a 20-year retirement.
- Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement
- Her current salary is $100,000
- So, she needs $100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000 per year for retirement
- To find out how much she needs to save in total, we multiply the amount she needs per year by the number of retirement years
- $40,000 * 20 = $800,000

**Step 5** Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work based on her current savings rate.
- Lauren saves $20,000 per year
- She needs $800,000 for retirement
- To find out how many years she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per year
- $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

**Step 6** Adjust the calculation for the fact that Lauren has already worked for some number of years.
- We don't know how many years Lauren has already worked, so we can't subtract that from the total number of years

**Step 7** Consider other factors that could affect the calculation, such as investment returns and inflation.
- We don't have enough information to take these factors into account

**Step 8** Provide a rough estimate of the number of years Lauren needs to work based on the given information.

### 1. Marty has a total of 100 centimeters of ribbon.

### 2. He wants to cut the ribbon into 4 equal parts.

### 3. To find the length of each equal part, we divide the total length by the number of equal parts.

### 4. So, the length of each of the 4 equal parts will be: 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

### 5. Now, each of the 4 equal parts must be divided into 5 equal parts.

### 6. To find the length of each final equal part, we divide the length of each equal part by the number of equal parts in the final division.

### 7. So, the length of each of the 5 equal parts will be: 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

### 8. To check if the final division is correct, we can calculate the total length of all the final equal parts.

### 9. The total length of all the final equal parts should be equal to the original length of the ribbon.

### 10. So, the total length of all the final equal parts is: 4 parts * 5 cm/part = 20 cm

- Soledad plans to hike twice a day.
- Each hiking session covers 125 miles.
- So, she hikes 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day.

**Step 3** Check if Soledad's current hiking plan is enough to cover the total miles in June.

- The lighthouse light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

**Step 2: Find the number of blinks per minute**
- To find the number of blinks per minute, divide the total number of blinks by the time taken in minutes.
- Blinks per minute = Total blinks / Time (in minutes)
- Blinks per minute = 255 / 5

**Step 3: Calculate the number of blinks per minute**
- Blinks per minute = 51

**Step 4: Find the number of minutes required for 459 blinks**
- To find the number of minutes required for 459 blinks, divide the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute.
- Minutes required = Total blinks / Blinks per minute
- Minutes required = 459 / 51

**Step 5: Calculate the number of minutes required**
- Minutes required = 9.12 (approximately)

**Step 6: Convert the decimal part of minutes to seconds**
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the decimal part of minutes can be converted to seconds by multiplying it by 60.
- Seconds = Decimal part of minutes * 60
- Seconds = 0.12 * 60

- Two workers produce 6 toys an hour.
- Another two workers produce 4 toys an hour.
- In total, these four workers produce 6 toys/hour * 2 workers = 12 toys/hour
- And they also produce 4 toys/hour * 2 workers = 8 toys/hour
- Together, they produce 12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

**Step 2: Determine how many toys have been produced during their 10-hour shift.**
- The first four workers produce 20 toys/hour
- They work for 10 hours
- So, they produce 20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

**Step 3: Calculate how many toys are still needed to complete the order.**
- The manufacturer needs 400 toys
- They have produced 200 toys
- So, they still need 400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys

**Step 4: Determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce in one hour to meet the remaining requirement.**
- The manufacturer still needs 200 toys
- Let's assume the fifth worker produces x toys per hour
- To produce 200 toys, the fifth worker would need to produce 200 toys / x hours

**Step 5: Solve for x to find the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker.**
- 200 toys / x hours = 200
- Cross-multiplying, we get x hours * 200 toys = 200 * x
- Dividing both sides by 200, we get x hours = 1 hour

**Step 6: Check if the calculation is reasonable.**
- The fifth worker produces 1 toy per hour, which is not a realistic number.
- Let's try another assumption that the fifth worker produces 10 toys per hour.
- In this case, the fifth worker would produce 10 toys/hour * 10 hours = 100 toys
- Adding these toys to the previous production, the manufacturer would have produced a total of 300 toys (200 from the first four workers and 100 from the fifth worker)
- However, this is still 100 toys short of the required 400 toys.

**Step 7: Consider the possibility that more than one fifth worker is available.**
- Let's assume there are two fifth workers, each producing 10 toys per hour.
- Together, they would produce 10 toys/hour * 2 workers * 10 hours = 200 toys
- Adding these toys to the previous production, the manufacturer would have produced a total of 500 toys (200 from the first four workers and 300 from the two fifth workers)

- Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.
- John bought 3 large bags.
- Total weight = 10 ounces/bag * 3 bags

### Step 2: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
- 1 pound = 16 ounces
- Total weight in pounds = Total weight in ounces / 16

### Step 3: Calculate the number of M&M in the large bags.
- An ounce of M&M contains 30 M&M.
- Total M&M in 3 large bags = Total weight in pounds * M&M per ounce

### Step 4: Calculate the number of small bags John can make.
- Each small bag holds 10 M&M.
- Number of small bags = Total M&M / M&M per small bag

### Step 5: Convert the number of M&M to the number of small bags.
- Number of small bags = Total M&M / M&M per small bag
- Number of small bags = (Total M&M / 30 M&M/ounce) * (10 M&M/small bag / 30 M&M/ounce)

### Step 6: Simplify the calculation.
- Number of small bags = (Total weight in pounds / 1 pound) * (10 / 30)

### Step 7: Perform the division.

- x + (5x/9) = 84
- Multiply both sides by 9: 9x + 5x = 752
- Combine like terms: 14x = 752
- Divide both sides by 14: x = 537/14
- Since x must be a whole number, this ratio does not correspond to a valid number of passengers

### Step 6: Try a different ratio
- Let's try a ratio of 4:7 instead of 5:9
- With this ratio, there are 4 men for every 7 women
- Let x be the number of women, then the number of men is 4x/7
- The total number of passengers is 84
- x + (4x/7) = 84

### Step 7: Solve the equation to find the number of women
- Multiply both sides by 7: 7x + 4x = 592
- Combine like terms: 11x = 592
- Divide both sides by 11: x = 538.18
- Since the number of women must be a whole number, this ratio also does not correspond to a valid number of passengers

### Step 8: Try another ratio
- Let's try a ratio of 3:8 instead of 5:9 or 4:7
- With this ratio, there are 3 men for every 8 women
- Let x be the number of women, then the number of men is 3x/8
- The total number of passengers is 84
- x + (3x/8) = 84

### Step 9: Solve the equation to find the number of women
- Multiply both sides by 8: 8x + 3x = 672
- Combine like terms: 11x = 672
- Divide both sides by 11: x = 602/11
- Since x must be a whole number, this ratio also does not correspond to a valid number of passengers

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

### Step 2: Fruit production of a 6-year-old avocado tree
- A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
- So, it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

### Step 3: Fruit production of a 7-year-old avocado tree
- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
- So, it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

### Step 4: Fruit production of an 8-year-old avocado tree
- An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 980 fruits.

### Step 5: Fruit production of a 9-year-old avocado tree
- A 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.

### Step 6: Fruit production of a 10-year-old avocado tree
- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
- So, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

### Step 7: Total fruit production during the 10-year period
- The total fruit production during the 10-year period is the sum of the fruit production in each year.
- Total fruit production = 50 + 150 + 350 + 980 + 0 + 1000

### Step 8: Calculate the sum
- The sum of the fruit production in each year is 50 + 150 + 350 + 980 + 0 + 1000 = 2185.

<step-2>. We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so `r = 4b`.

<step-3>. We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so `b = y - 7`.

<step-4>. We're given that the combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so `b + y + r = 37`.

<step-5>. Substitute `b = y - 7` into the equation: `(y - 7) + y + 4(y - 7) = 37`.

<step-6>. Simplify the equation: `2y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37`.

- Ronnie was given $5.
- Rissa was given thrice as much, so she was given $5 * 3 = $15.

### Step 2:
- After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, the amount of money left with Rissa is 4/5 of her initial amount.
- Let's denote the amount of money given to the little sister as X.

### Step 3:
- The amount of money Rissa had after giving X to her little sister is 4/5 * $15.
- The amount of money Ronnie had after giving X to his little sister is $5 + X.

### Step 4:
- Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, we can set up the equation: 4/5 * $15 = $5 + X.

### Step 5:
- Solving for X, we first isolate X on one side of the equation: X = $5 + ($15 * 1/4).
- Simplifying the expression, we get X = $5 + ($3.75).
- Therefore, X = $8.75.

### Step 6:
- Now that we know the amount of money given to their little sister, we can find out how much money is left with Ronnie: $5 + $8.75 = $13.75.

- Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

### Step 2: Calculate how many snowballs Jay loses due to melting every 15 minutes.
- 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
- To find out how many snowballs melt in an hour, we need to calculate how many 15-minute intervals there are in an hour.
- There are 4 intervals in an hour (60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4).
- So, Jay loses 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs per hour.

### Step 3: Determine how many snowballs Jay needs in total.
- Jay wants 60 snowballs.

### Step 4: Calculate how many hours it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs.
- Jay can build 20 snowballs per hour.
- He loses 8 snowballs per hour due to melting.
- To find out how many hours it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many hours it takes to build 60 snowballs without considering the melting.
- We can do this by dividing the total number of snowballs Jay needs by the number of snowballs he can build per hour: 60 / 20 = 3 hours.
- Since Jay loses 8 snowballs per hour, we need to add the time it takes for him to build those snowballs back: 8 / 20 = 0.4 hours.

### Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs.
- Jay can build 3 hours worth of snowballs in 3 hours.
- He loses 0.4 hours worth of snowballs to melting every hour.
- So, it takes 3 hours + 0.4 hours * 3 = 3.12 hours for Jay to have 60 snowballs.

1188," **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When it came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is currently 28 years old.

**Step 2: Determine John's age when Digimon came out**
- John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.
- Let's denote Jim's age as J.
- Then, John's age was 2J when Digimon came out.

**Step 3: Determine the number of years that have passed since Digimon came out**
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so 20 years have passed since it came out.

**Step 4: Find the difference in age between John and Jim now**
- The difference in their ages now is 28 (John's current age) - J (Jim's current age).

**Step 5: Solve for Jim's age using the information from steps 2 and 4**
- We know that John's age difference from Jim has remained constant (John was twice as old when Digimon came out and he is still twice as old now).
- So, the difference in their ages is 20 years (since Digimon came out) plus the difference in their current ages.
- Therefore, J = 28 - 20 + J.
- Solving for J, we get J = 9.

**Step 6: Check the solution**
- John is currently 28 years old.
- Jim's age is 9 years old.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim, so Jim was 9/2 = 4.5 years old.
- However, since ages are measured in whole numbers, we cannot have a person being 0.5 years old.
- Instead, we can assume that Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out, and John was 8 years old.
- In this case, the difference in their ages is 4 years, which is consistent with the information given.

**Step 7: Consider the alternative solution**
- We assumed Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out, but the given information only states that John was twice as old as Jim.
- It's possible that Jim was actually 5 years old when Digimon came out, and John was 10 years old.
- In this case, the difference in their ages is 5 years, which is also consistent with the information given.
- However, since the information does not provide enough details to definitively determine Jim's age when Digimon came out, both solutions are valid.

**Step 8: Consider real-world implications**
- In reality, the exact ages of Jim and John when Digimon came out are not crucial information.
- What is important is that the difference in their ages has remained constant (John is always twice as old as Jim).

**Step 9: State the final result**
- Jim's age can be either 4 or 5 years old when Digimon came out, depending on the interpretation of the given information.

**Step 10: Provide a final answer**
- Final result: Jim was either 4 or 5 years old when Digimon came out.

**Step 3** On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, so they used x + 50 - 10 = x + 40 bandages.

**Step 4** On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had x + 50 + 50 + 25 = x + 125 bandages at the end of the third day.

**Step 5** They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so x + 125 = 78 + 125.

- One-third of 66 fish have red stripes.
- Calculate 1/3 of 66: 66 ÷ 3 = 22
- So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

**Step 2** Determine the number of remaining fish.
- Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish: 66 - 22 = 44

**Step 3** Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes.
- 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
- Calculate 5/11 of 44: (5 × 44) ÷ 11 = 15.36 ≈ 16 (since we can't have a fraction of a fish)

**Step 4** Check if the calculated number of fish with blue stripes is valid.
- The total number of fish should be equal to the sum of fish with red stripes and fish with blue stripes.
- Verify: 22 (red stripes) + 16 (blue stripes) = 38, which is less than the total number of fish (66).
- This indicates an error in the problem statement.

**Step 5** Revisit the problem statement and check for potential errors.
- The problem statement may contain an error in the calculation of the number of fish with blue stripes.
- Check the calculation: 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
- Calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish: (5 × 44) ÷ 11 = 15.36 ≈ 16
- However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to find the remainder when dividing the total number of fish by the sum of the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

**Step 6** Calculate the remainder.
- The total number of fish is 66.
- The number of fish with red stripes is 22.
- The number of fish with blue stripes is 16.
- Calculate the remainder when dividing the total number of fish by the sum of the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes: 66 % (22 + 16) = 66 % 38 = 12

**Step 7** Determine the number of fish with blue stripes.
- The remainder indicates that there are 12 additional fish with blue stripes.
- Add the previously calculated number of fish with blue stripes to the number of additional fish: 16 + 12 = 28

**Step 8** Verify the total number of fish.
- The total number of fish should be equal to the sum of fish with red stripes and fish with blue stripes.
- Verify: 22 (red stripes) + 28 (blue stripes) = 50, which is not equal to the total number of fish (66).
- This indicates an inconsistency in the problem statement.

**Step 9** Revisit the problem statement and check for potential errors (continued).
- The problem statement may contain an error in the calculation of the number of fish with red stripes or blue stripes.
- Check the calculation: One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
- Calculate one-third of the fish: 66 ÷ 3 = 22
- Calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish: (5 × 44) ÷ 11 = 15.36 ≈ 16
- However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to find the remainder when dividing the total number of fish by the sum of the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

**Step 10** Calculate the correct number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.
- The total number of fish is 66.
- The number of fish with red stripes is 22.
- The number of fish with blue stripes is 16 + 12 = 28.

**Step 2**: Let's denote the total number of shells as S. Then, the number of shells found by Team Alphas is 0.4S, and the number of shells found by Team The Finders is 0.6 * (S - 0.4S) = 0.6S - 0.24S = 0.36S.

**Step 3**: The total number of shells is the sum of the shells found by all teams. So, S = 0.4S + 0.36S + X, where X is the number of shells found by Team Gogetters.

**Step 4**: Solving for S, we get S = 0.76S + X, which implies S = X / 0.24.

**Step 5**: Since S is the total number of shells, we can express the number of shells found by Team Gogetters as X = 3 * S / 2, because there were 20 tourists in total, and each team had 7 tourists.

**Step 6**: Substituting S = X / 0.24 into the expression for X, we get X = 3 * (X / 0.24) / 2.

<step-2>. The cost of one visit is $2, so Pauline spends $2 on each visit.

<step-3>. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, so the new cost of one visit is $2 * 1.15 = <<2*1.15=2.3>>$2.3.

<step-4>. For the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year, so she makes a total of 3 * 3 * 12 = <<3*3*12=108>>108 visits.

<step-5>. The cost of one visit has increased to $2.3, so Pauline spends $2.3 on each visit.

<step-6>. Therefore, Pauline spends 180 * $2 + 108 * $2.3 = $<<180*2+108*2.3=511.4>>511.4 on all visits to the museum in 8 years.

<step-7>. However, the question asks for the amount spent in 11 years, not 8. Since Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year, she makes an additional 11 * 3 * 12 = <<11*3*12=132>>132 visits.

- Let's represent the number of cupcakes as `x`.
- Then, the number of brownies is `3x - 2`.

**Step 2** Determine the total number of treats for the class.
- There are 5 people in the class.
- Each person gets 2 treats.
- So, the total number of treats is `5 * 2 = 10`.

**Step 3** Find the total number of cupcakes and brownies.
- Each person gets 2 treats, so Carly needs to make enough treats for 10 treats * 2 = `20 treats`.
- Since we know the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies, we can set up the equation: `x (cupcakes) + (3x - 2) (brownies) = 20`.

**Step 4** Solve for the number of cupcakes.
- To find the number of cupcakes, we need to isolate the `x` term.
- First, subtract `3x` from both sides: `x - 3x + 2 = 20`.
- Then, combine like terms: `-2x + 2 = 20`.
- Next, subtract 2 from both sides: `-2x = 18`.
- Finally, divide both sides by -2: `x = -9`.

**Step 5** Since the number of cupcakes cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculation.
- Let's go back to the equation: `x (cupcakes) + (3x - 2) (brownies) = 20`.
- We need to find an integer value for `x` that satisfies the equation.
- Let's try `x = 4`.

**Step 6** Check if `x = 4` is a valid solution.
- With `x = 4`, we have `4 (cupcakes) + (3*4 - 2) (brownies) = 20`.
- Simplifying, we get `4 + (12-2) = 20`.
- This simplifies to `4 + 10 = 14`, which is not equal to 20.

**Step 7** Let's try another value for `x`.
- Let's try `x = 5`.

**Step 8** Check if `x = 5` is a valid solution.
- With `x = 5`, we have `5 (cupcakes) + (3*5 - 2) (brownies) = 20`.
- Simplifying, we get `5 + (15-2) = 20`.
- This simplifies to `5 + 13 = 18`, which is not equal to 20.

**Step 9** Let's try one more value for `x`.
- Let's try `x = 6`.

**Step 10** Check if `x = 6` is a valid solution.
- With `x = 6`, we have `6 (cupcakes) + (3*6 - 2) (brownies) = 20`.
- Simplifying, we get `6 + (18-2) = 20`.
- This simplifies to `6 + 16 = 22`, which is not equal to 20.

1. The price of the toy in November was $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%.
3. To find the new price, we can use the formula: New Price = Old Price * (1 + Percentage Increase)
4. Plugging in the values, we get: New Price = $40 * (1 + 0.8)
5. Simplifying, we get: New Price = $40 * 1.8
6. Multiplying, we get: New Price = $72

## Step 2: Find the price of the toy after the 50% discount in January
1. The price of the toy in January was $72 after the 80% increase in December.
2. In January, the price decreased by 50%.
3. To find the new price, we can use the formula: New Price = Old Price * (1 - Percentage Decrease)
4. Plugging in the values, we get: New Price = $72 * (1 - 0.5)
5. Simplifying, we get: New Price = $72 * 0.5

## Solution to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away

1. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as 'x'.
2. We know that Eve had 20 pomelos initially and is now left with 1/4 of them.
3. So, the number of pomelos Eve has left is 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos.
4. Therefore, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

<hr>

## Breakdown of the solution

1. **Initial situation**: Eve had 20 pomelos.
2. **Current situation**: Eve is left with 5 pomelos.
3. **Difference**: The difference between the initial and current number of pomelos is the number of pomelos Eve gave away.
4. **Calculate the difference**: Subtract the current number of pomelos from the initial number.
5. **Check the calculation**: 20 (initial) - 5 (current) = 15.
6. **Final result**: Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

- Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples he bought.
- Calculate 2/5 of 60: (2/5) * 60 = 48

**Step 2: Determine the number of apples Walter gave to his sister**
- Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
- First, find the total number of apples left after eating: 60 - 48 = 12
- Then, calculate 25% of 12: 0.25 * 12 = 3

**Step 3: Determine the number of apples Walter sold**
- Subtract the number of apples Walter ate and gave away: 60 - 48 - 3 = 9

**Step 4: Determine the revenue Walter received from selling apples**
- Walter sold each apple for $3.
- Multiply the number of apples sold by the price per apple: 9 * $3 = $27

- So, Tim spends 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day on calls.

**Step 2** Determine the number of calls Tim deals with per minute.
- It takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call.
- Therefore, Tim deals with 1 call / (15 minutes/call) = 1 call/quarter hour or 4 calls/hour.

<step-6>. To find the total time difference for 6 paintings, we multiply the time difference for one painting by the number of paintings: 5 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 30 minutes.
<step-7>. Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer to dry the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.
<step-8>. In summary, the new varnish takes 5 minutes longer to dry per painting compared to the old varnish.
<step-9>. When applying the new varnish to 6 paintings, this time difference adds up to an extra 30 minutes.

John's starting speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).

### Step 2:
After training, his speaking speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. So, his new speaking speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

### Step 3:
Each page contains 450 words.

### Step 4:
To find out how long it takes John to speak 10 pages, we first need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages.

### Step 5:
Total number of words in 10 pages = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words.

### Step 6:
Now, we calculate how long it takes John to speak 4500 words at his new speaking speed.

### Step 7:
Time taken to speak 4500 words = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.

### Step 8:
Since John is speaking continuously without any breaks, we can assume that the time taken to turn pages or catch his breath is negligible.

- We know that there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family.
- Let's denote the older brother as Brother A and the younger brother as Brother B.

### Step 2:
- Brother B is half the age of Brother A.
- So, Brother B's age is `(1/2) * Brother A's age`.

### Step 3:
- We also know that there are 3 sisters, and they are all the same age, which is 16 years old.

### Step 4:
- Let's denote the common age of the sisters as Sister's Age.

### Step 5:
- The total number of siblings is 2 brothers + 3 sisters = 5 siblings.

### Step 6:
- We have two equations based on the given information:
  - Brother B's age = `(1/2) * Brother A's age`
  - Sister's Age = 16

### Step 7:
- To find the total age of all siblings, we need to find the ages of both brothers and the common age of the sisters.

### Step 8:
- Since we know that Sister's Age = 16, this information is not directly related to finding the ages of the brothers.

### Step 9:
- From the given information, we can only determine the age difference between the two brothers.

## Step 1: Determine the number of eggs in each basket
- There are 10 eggs in the first basket.

## Step 2: Determine the number of eggs in the second basket
- We know that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as there are in the first basket.
- So, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

## Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs in both baskets
- The total number of eggs in both baskets is the sum of the eggs in each basket.
- Total eggs = Eggs in basket 1 + Eggs in basket 2
- Total eggs = 10 + 20

## Step 4: Summarize the results
- There are 10 eggs in the first basket.
- There are 20 eggs in the second basket.
- Together, there are 10 + 20 = 30 eggs in both baskets.

#### The final result is: There are 30 eggs in both baskets.

<step-2>. Each cow has 4 legs.
<step-3>. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K.
<step-4>. We know that the total number of legs is 70. So, we can write the equation: 2C + 4K = 70.
<step-5>. To solve this equation, we can first isolate C. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 2C = 68 - 4K.
<step-6>. Dividing both sides by 2, we find: C = 34 - 2K.
<step-7>. Since the number of chickens and cows must be non-negative, K cannot be greater than 17.
<step-8>. For K = 16, C = 10. However, this would result in fewer than 20 animals.
<step-9>. For K = 17, C = 9. This also results in fewer than 20 animals.
<step-10>. Therefore, the smallest possible value for K that results in 20 animals is 18. For K = 18, C = 2.
