The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems are not well understood. Chaotic systems with asymmetric periodic potentials and directed transport have been studied. The behavior of individual trajectories in the system is complex and depends on parameters and initial conditions. A bifurcation diagram is used to understand the behavior of the current as a function of system parameters. The current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble. Single trajectories are not sufficient to obtain accurate results for chaotic systems. The convergence of curves in the bifurcation diagram towards a single value as the number of trajectories increases. Ensemble averages of the current are typically smaller than single-trajectory values.

The study examines the eccentricity of exoplanets in multiple-planet systems. The authors analyze observations from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and the Keck Telescope to determine the orbital parameters of six highly eccentric planetary systems. They use test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in each system. The results show that nearly all test-particle removals occur within the first year of simulations, indicating that additional planets are unlikely to remain in stable orbits in these systems. The study also compares the parameters derived from the HET data with those of previous studies and finds good agreement.

The study investigates the properties of the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson in four new physics models: the type-II 2HDM, the L2HDM, the NMSSM, and the NMSSM with a singlet. The rare decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of CP-odd Higgs bosons, CP-odd Higgs boson and a fermion, and a pair of CP-odd Higgs bosons and a fermion are studied. The constraints on the models from recent experiments are also discussed. The study finds that the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson mass in the models can be as low as 10 GeV, which is within the expected sensitivity of future experiments. The properties of the lightest CP-odd Higgs boson are found to be limited tightly, which can be used to test the models. The study also finds that the nmSSM has its own peculiarity in its neutralino sector, which can affect the relic density of the lightest neutralino.

The paper discusses the phenomenological implications of the no-scale structure of the KÃ¤hler potential in supersymmetric models. The authors review the current bounds on the lightest Higgs mass and the branching ratio for the process @xmath0, and use these bounds to constrain the parameter space of the no-scale scenario. They find that the minimal scenario is severely constrained, but the other two scenarios are not. They also include the current higgs mass bound and @xmath12 constraint in their analysis. The paper shows that the higgs mass bound almost excludes the region where the stau lsp is avoided, and that the @xmath12 constraint is not so important when the interference between chargino and sm contributions is constructive.

The paper discusses the stability of quasiregular singularities in cross-polarized plane wave spacetimes. The authors investigate the nature of singularities formed in the interaction region of cross-polarized plane waves using the null dust method. They find that the singularities are quasiregular and unstable, and their stability is confirmed by a back-reaction analysis. The authors also consider the effect of added test fields on the stability of the singularities and find that the qr singularities are unstable. They further analyze the nature of the singularities using a test scalar field and find that the stress-energy tensor of the scalar field diverges at the qr singularity. The authors conclude that the stability conjecture proposed in the paper correctly finds the stability of quasiregular singularities in cross-polarized plane wave spacetimes.

The paper discusses the detection of x-ray emission from normal galaxies in the deep field of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S). The authors use the CDF-S survey to study the x-ray properties of galaxies in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.8, focusing on normal galaxies with optical morphologies similar to those in the local universe. The study includes the detection of x-ray emission from galaxies in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.4 using the soft and hard bands, and the calculation of the x-ray luminosity of galaxies in the rest-frame 0.52 keV band. The results show that the x-ray luminosity of normal galaxies increases with redshift, and that the x-ray emission from these galaxies is dominated by x-ray binaries.

The paper discusses the non-local properties of quantum states, specifically the concepts of Bell non-locality, EPR steerability, and separability. Bell non-locality refers to the violation of local causality, while EPR steerability is the ability to demonstrate non-local correlations through measurements on one party's system. Separability refers to the ability to describe the correlations between two parties using a product of local states. The paper introduces the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism, which is used to determine the EPR steerability of a quantum state. The steering ellipsoid is a surface in Bloch space that represents the set of possible steered states for a given measurement setting. The paper gives a necessary condition for EPR steerability, which is shown to be sufficient for a large class of two-qubit states. The condition is obtained via the construction of a suitable lhs model, which is motivated by properties of the quantum steering ellipsoid. The paper also discusses the relationship between EPR steerability and the quantum steering ellipsoid, and finds a direct connection for the case where the bloch vectors vanish.

The idea of using spintronics to create a universal logic gate was first proposed in 1985 by Feynman. The concept involves using the spin of electrons in a magnetic field to encode binary information. The proposed gate is based on the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of spins, which can be controlled by an external magnetic field. The gate is designed to have three spins placed in a weak magnetic field, with the potential barrier between neighboring dots weak enough to allow exchange interaction between the spins. The exchange interaction enforces anti-ferromagnetic ordering between the spins, and the ground state of the array is determined by the orientation of the magnetic field. The proposed gate can be used to create a universal logic circuit by connecting multiple NAND gates. However, the gate faces a problem due to the bidirectional nature of exchange interaction, which can prevent the unidirectional flow of logic signal from the input to the output. To overcome this issue, the distance between cells needs to be increased, which can enforce unidirectionality in time. Alternatively, a three-phase clock can be used to propagate the input state through a linear array of cells.

The paper investigates the cataclysmic variables (CVs) with short orbital periods, specifically the period gap and the minimum period. The authors use a stellar evolution code to calculate the long-term evolution of CVs and investigate the effect of caml (consequential angular momentum loss) on the minimum period. They find that the minimum period increases with increasing caml efficiency and that the observed period distribution can be reproduced by increasing the mass transfer rate. The authors also consider the effect of deformation of the secondary star on the minimum period and find that it can have a significant impact. They conclude that the observed period gap and minimum period can be explained by a combination of caml and deformation effects.

The Stephan's Quintet is a strongly interacting compact group of galaxies that has produced a highly disturbed intragroup medium (IGM) through a complex sequence of interactions and harassment. The group contains a large-scale intergalactic shock wave that is detected in the radio continuum and X-ray emissions. The shock wave is observed to heat the gas and excite the molecular hydrogen (H@xmath5) emission, which is traced by pure rotational lines. The H@xmath5 emission is found to be clumpy and distributed along the shock front, with the brightest emission concentrated towards the north of the shock. The study of the H@xmath5 emission provides valuable insights into the excitation mechanisms and the properties of the shock wave in the Stephan's Quintet system.

The text discusses the injection of isotopic heterogeneity in protoplanetary disks through various mechanisms, including supernova shock waves, photodissociation of CO molecules, and magnetorotational instability (MRI). The author presents new sets of marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk models that examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula through these mechanisms. The models explore the effect of different protostellar and protoplanetary disk masses, initial minimum @xmath2 stability parameters, and injection radii on the deviations from uniformity of the color field about its mean radial value. The author notes that the fact that molecular hydrogen constitutes the majority of a disk's mass but cannot be directly detected means that estimates of disk masses are uncertain. Observations of the DG Tau disk have shown that it irradiates its outer layers with a strong UV flux, sufficient for significant UV photolysis and the formation of observable water vapor. The author suggests that the MGU disk masses assumed in these models may be achieved in some fraction of protoplanetary disks, and perhaps in the solar nebula as well. The text also presents results for a variety of protostellar and protoplanetary disk masses, initial minimum @xmath2 stability parameters, and injection radii for disks of two different sizes.

The search includes a dijet mass spectrum analysis and a cut-based analysis for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels. The data are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations, and limits are set on new particle production. The search also includes a study of the angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region @xmath26 gev / c@xmath1, which is found to be compatible with both qcd alone and qcd + 5% excited quark. The large mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may be special, and topcolor is assumed to be the source of the fluctuation. The topcolor is searched for in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels, and limits are set on the cross section for topcolor production. The search also finds an upward fluctuation near 600 gev / c@xmath1 in the b-tagged dijet mass distribution, which is modeled using pythia z@xmath3 production and a cdf detector simulation.

The spectra of type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) show a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of the gas in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. Broad emission lines like H@xmath0 are found in or near the accretion disk, while narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are regarded as a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame. The H@xmath0 profile shows a diversity of line widths and profile shifts, and there are two populations of AGN with different fwhm values. Population A has fwhm values between 1000 and 4000, while population B has fwhm values between 4000 and 12000. The H@xmath0 profile of population B shows a blend of two components: a broad component with fwhm=4000-5000 and a very broad component with fwhm=10000-12000. The narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are found to be ubiquitous in bright quasars, and there is evidence for a systematic redshift of the broad emission lines relative to the narrow lines.

The present paper deals with the improvement of the microcanonical multifragmentation model proposed in a previous work. The model is refined to include the primary break-up stage and the secondary particle emission stage. The new version of the model is employed to evaluate the caloric curve and the heat capacity as a function of excitation energy and temperature. The results show an excellent agreement between the calculated heli isotopic temperature curve and the experimental data recently evaluated by the Aladin group. The model proves its ability to simultaneously fit the characteristic features of nuclear multifragmentation. The equilibrated source sequence is evaluated, and a nonequilibrium part of the experimentally evaluated excitation energy is identified, growing with the increase of the bombarding energy.

The article discusses the detection of water vapor in the Orion molecular cloud using the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition of H2O at 183 GHz and the 5@xmath17 - 4@xmath18 transition at 325 GHz. The observations were made with the 10.4 m telescope of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The article reports the detection of extended water emission at 325 GHz and estimates the H2O abundance to be @xmath4 10@xmath5 in the * plateau*. The observations provide much finer spatial resolution than ISO or SWAS and an estimate of x(H2O) as accurate as that obtained from the extremely optically thick H2O lines observed in the submillimeter and far-infrared domains. The article also compares the line profiles of the H2O lines at 183 and 325 GHz and finds that the 325 GHz emission is spatially extended, indicating the presence of many masing point-like sources strongly diluted in the beam. The article concludes that the densities needed to reproduce the observed brightness temperatures of the maser spots at 22 GHz would result in thermal or suprathermal 183 GHz line, suggesting large column densities are required to reproduce the observed 183 GHz and 325 GHz intensities.

The authors find that threshold nets, which are a special case of sequence nets, have a high degree of modularity and can be designed with a particular degree distribution. They also discover that any ensemble of sequence nets admits a natural ordering, which can be used to explore their structural properties. The authors derive the structural properties of the new classes of two-letter sequence nets, @xmath47 and @xmath57, and find that they have a high degree of symmetry. They also show that the connectivity rules for these nets can be represented as directed graphs, where the nodes represent the letters of the sequence alphabet. Finally, they demonstrate that plotting a structural property against the alphabetical ordering of the ensemble reveals the inner structure of the ensemble.

They conclude that the nonlinear current response is a sensitive probe of the order parameter symmetry and can be used to study the properties of superconductors.

The article discusses the entanglement dynamics of two independent qubits interacting with two local reservoirs. The authors show that the entanglement evolution is not destroyed but rather redistributed among all bipartite subsystems. They find that the entanglement can be stably distributed among all possible bipartite partitions in certain parameter regimes. The article also compares the entanglement distribution in the presence of non-Markovian effects and Markovian approximations. The results reveal that the non-Markovian effect leads to a different entanglement distribution compared to the Markovian approximation. The article provides a detailed analysis of the entanglement evolution and its distribution in the presence of non-Markovian effects.

The author introduces the concept of shower partons, which are defined as the partons that initiate the shower in the fragmentation process. The author aims to determine the properties of shower partons and their distributions using the recombination model. The model is based on the idea that shower partons can recombine to form hadrons, and the distribution of shower partons is related to the fragmentation function. The author uses the recombination model to determine the properties of shower partons and their distributions, which are then used to calculate the fragmentation function. The paper also discusses the role of strange quarks and gluons in the fragmentation process and how they are included in the recombination model. The author concludes that the shower parton distribution is an important hadronization mechanism in high-energy nuclear collisions.

The paper proposes a new method for solving nonconvex semidefinite programming problems by using inner psd-convex approximations. The method is based on a modified alternating direction method, which alternates between solving a sequence of convex semidefinite programming subproblems and updating the regularization parameter. The algorithm starts with an initial point and generates a sequence of feasible points by solving a sequence of convex semidefinite programming subproblems. The regularization parameter is updated based on a given criterion, and the algorithm terminates when a satisfactory solution is found. The proposed method can handle nonconvex matrix-valued mappings and is applicable to a wide range of problems, including static output feedback control and spectral abscissa problems.

The paper discusses the application of a discrete differential geometry to the Dirac-Khler formulation of fermionic field theories. The authors propose a local, discrete differential geometry for an arbitrary topological space and its formal aspects have been thoroughly studied by previous works. The discrete geometry consists of a complex space with points, links, faces, volumes, and hyper-volumes, and each point is associated with a simplex and a cochain. The cochains act as discrete differential forms, and the wedge product between cochains is defined using the Whitney map and the de Rham map. The hodge star is defined to map a cochain to a cochain in the dual complex, and the adjoint derivative and Laplacian are defined using the hodge star. The inner product is defined using the barycentric subdivided complex, and the correspondence between the Dirac spinor and the Dirac-Khler field is established. The paper shows how the two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Khler formulation.

The study of harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds has been initiated by Fuller, Nash, and Sampson. The energy functional of a smooth map between Riemannian manifolds is defined, and the tension field of a harmonic map is studied. The premise of harmonic maps has acknowledged several important contributions and has been successfully applied in computational fluid dynamics, minimal surface theory, string theory, gravity, and quantum field theory. The harmonic maps between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds behave differently, and their study must be subject to some restricted classes of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The paper organizes the study of harmonic maps between para-Hermitian manifolds and para-Sasakian manifolds. The fundamental form of almost para-Hermitian manifolds is defined, and the co-differential of the almost para-Hermitian structure is given. An almost para-Hermitian manifold is called para-KÃ¤hler if it admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric with a specific signature.

The authors use CDFT to study the adsorption of a benzene molecule on a 2D metal, specifically graphene, and calculate the charge transfer energies for different molecule-to-substrate distances. They find that the addition and removal energies decrease in absolute value as the molecule is brought closer to the graphene sheet, and that the presence of defects in the graphene sheet does not significantly alter the charge transfer energies. The authors also discuss the equilibrium distance of a benzene molecule adsorbed on graphene, which they obtain by minimizing the total energy difference between the cell containing the molecule and graphene, and the cell containing only the molecule or graphene. The results are in fair agreement with another theoretical study using the local density approximation (LDA).

The paper discusses the role of many-body effects in critical Casimir forces (CCFs) in a binary liquid mixture near its consolute point. The authors use field-theoretic mean-field theory (MFT) to compute the universal scaling functions of the CCFs and analyze their behavior in the vicinity of the critical point. They find that the many-body effects lead to a non-additive behavior of the CCFs, which can be described using a scaling theory. The authors also show that the normalized scaling functions of the CCFs can be expressed in terms of the amplitude of the CCF at a single colloid, which can be calculated using MFT.

The article discusses the hydrogenation of coronene cations in the gas phase through exposure to hydrogen atoms. The study uses mass spectrometry to identify the changes in mass of the coronene cations, which indicates their respective degrees of hydrogenation. The results show that the most important peaks measured in the mass spectrum shift from lower masses to higher masses with increasing hydrogen exposure time. The evolution of the hydrogenation states of coronene cations with time is described using an Arrhenius expression. The article also includes a kinetic chemical model that shows that abstraction has to be very low compared to hydrogenation to mimic the experimental results. The first hydrogenation is expected to take place at the outer edge carbon atom, and the contribution of every peak is determined by fitting the data with gaussians. The ratios between different hydrogenation states as a function of time are reported, and the energy barriers for hydrogenation are derived. The study shows that hydrogenation barriers are decreasing with increasing hydrogenation, but odd hydrogenated states dominate.

The paper discusses the implications of the unknowability of wave functions for the second as a unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI). The author argues that the wave function, which is used to explain experimental evidence, cannot be unconditionally known, and that the distinction between the wave function and probabilities implies a gap between explanation and evidence. The paper also explores the consequences of this unknowability for digital communications and spacetime geometry, and suggests that the discipline of logical synchronization may provide a framework for understanding these concepts. Finally, the author highlights the importance of exploring constraints on receptive phases imposed by gravitation, as a path to measuring gravitational curvature.</summary>

The paper discusses the limitations of the moped algorithm, a method for speeding up the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis. The algorithm compresses the data and creates compressed parameters that are independent and have unit variance, simplifying the likelihood calculation. However, the algorithm can create additional modes of likelihood that are not present in the original likelihood function, leading to problems in parameter estimation. The paper demonstrates this limitation through several test cases, including a one-dimensional case with a sine-Gaussian burst signal and a two-dimensional case with varying burst polarization and time of arrival. The results show that moped can create additional peaks in the likelihood function that are not present in the original likelihood, highlighting the need for careful application of the algorithm.

The authors suggest that the vacuum energy density can be a candidate of dark energy, and propose a conjecture on a candidate of dark energy based on the assumptions that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively and that external gravitons can not take the same place in the zero total four-momentum state. The article also discusses the evolution of the cosmological constant in the case with superpartners and identifies the zero point energy of graviton as a source of dark energy.

The paper presents a new technique for studying atomic properties of higher excited states using two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy. The technique involves using two lasers, one for excitation and another for probing, and modulating the probe laser frequency to generate sidebands that are used to study the atomic properties. The paper describes the theoretical model of the three-level atom in ladder configuration, which is used to interpret the experimental results. The experimental setup consists of a coherent 899-01 Ti:Sapphire laser for the pump laser, a small amount of laser power from the pump laser for frequency modulation, and a glass cell filled with rubidium at room temperature for locking the laser frequency to the crossover line of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 hyperfine levels. The paper presents two ladder systems, @xmath1 and @xmath2, to illustrate the main features of the technique and two different applications of the modulation. The technique is shown to be highly sensitive and can observe resonant features of the @xmath56 hyperfine manifold with little as 100 @xmath54w of probe power. The paper also demonstrates the ability to stabilize the frequency of the probe laser using the demodulated absorption spectrum.

The paper focuses on the potential of forward proton detectors at the LHC to observe the central exclusive production of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and the Supersymmetric (SUSY) Higgs boson. The detectors are proposed to be installed at 220 m and 420 m from the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The acceptance of the detectors is governed by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam and the aperture of the LHC beam elements. The cross section for the central exclusive production of a SM Higgs boson decaying into b-quarks is predicted to be 1.86 fb for three different parton distribution functions. The paper also discusses the potential of the detectors to observe the central exclusive production of the SUSY Higgs boson in the 119.5 GeV mass range.

The Orion dwarf galaxy is a nearby system that provides a unique opportunity to test the nature of dark matter (DM). The galaxy's rotation curve (RC) has been measured using a tilted ring model, which reveals that the DM halo is cored and not peaked. The RC is well-fitted by a model with a constant density core, and the baryonic components are efficiently modeled with no prominent central bulge. The stellar surface brightness profile is well-fitted by an exponential disk, and the gas disk shows rich morphological and kinematic structure. The total gas mass is found to be 4.7@xmath40.7@xmath910@xmath22, and the surface density profile rises from the center of the galaxy, reaches a maximum, and then declines exponentially. The RC of the galaxy was derived by fitting a tilted ring model to the intensity-weighted mean velocity field, and the resulting profile is consistent with a cored DM halo.

The authors use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the dependence of galaxy properties on color, luminosity, and density at different scales. They find that the density of galaxies at small scales (less than 0.5 @xmath2 mpc) is important for determining the color and luminosity of galaxies, while the density at larger scales (greater than 0.5 @xmath2 mpc) also plays a role. The authors also find that the relationship between galaxy properties and environment is non-monotonic, with different behaviors at different luminosity and color ranges. They conclude that both local and larger-scale environments are important for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.

The method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral in order to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators. The method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and is illustrated with three applications involving the af ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model. The results show that the method parallel to the spin-wave theory (SWT) approach and differs from the method involving self-energy corrections. The method has been demonstrated to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity. The paper also considers the problem of spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit and shows that the method is applicable in the whole range of vacancy concentration.

The dipole moments of elementary particles have been measured to a wealth of information on the standard model value of @xmath20, which is a fundamental parameter in the standard model of particle physics. The hadronic contribution to @xmath20 has been calculated, but the accuracy of this calculation is limited by the low energy scale of the process. Theoretical predictions suggest that supersymmetric theories could provide a measurable contribution to @xmath20. The muon anomaly is a sensitive probe of new physics beyond the standard model, and the discrepancy between the experimental value of @xmath20 and the standard model value could indicate the presence of new physics. The experimental value of @xmath20 has been measured to a precision of 0.66 ppm, and the goal of future experiments is to reach a precision of 0.1 ppm.

The system is subject to both dispersive and reactive coupling. The authors examine the effects of reactive coupling on the system and find that it leads to normal mode splitting in the output fields. The peak separation increases with increasing pump power. The authors also find that the stokes field can be amplified by the stimulated process and that the maximum gain depends on the system parameters. The nonlinear nature of the reactive coupling generates anti-stokes radiation. The authors plot the real and imaginary parts of the roots of the denominator of the output power at the stokes frequency as a function of the pump power and find that the imaginary parts of the roots change with increasing pump power.

The paper discusses the dynamics of a quantum Ising chain under the influence of an external transverse field. The authors study the transport properties of the system, including the magnetization, and observe power-law decay of the magnetization with time. They find that the system does not exhibit thermalization, even in the absence of an external field, and that the power-law decay is independent of the strength of the external field. The authors also show that the underlying dynamics at each site exhibits two different timescales of oscillation, with the smaller timescale contributing insignificant undulations and the larger timescale exhibiting generic power-law decay. They further find that the phase transition in the system is manifested in two ways, and that the frequency of the characteristic oscillation is a monotonic function of the external field for as long as the system is in the ordered phase. The authors also construct an initial configuration incorporating odd-occupation basis states and show that the magnetization at any given site can be calculated analytically under certain conditions. Finally, they observe that the dynamics of the system are not thermal, even in the thermodynamic limit, and that the power-law decay of the magnetization is a generic feature of the system.

The study of the color superconducting phase of quark matter at finite baryon density is crucial for understanding the structure of compact stars and the behavior of matter at extreme densities. The behavior of quarks in this phase is characterized by the diquark gap parameter, which is determined by the unknown nonperturbative gluon fields. The external gluon fields do not contribute to the properties of the system, and therefore, the Lagrangian density does not include any gauge field part. The quark field is a flavor doublet and color triplet, and the bosonic fields in the Nambu-Gorkov space are related to the quark propagator. The thermodynamic potential corresponding to the solution of the gapless state is a local maximum, and under certain constraints, such as charge neutrality, the gapless phase can be a thermal stable state. The chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase is a puzzle, and the instability is related to the mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks. The nambu-Goldstone current generation picture can cover the gluon phase as well as the one-plane wave loff state.

The debate over the properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems has been ongoing for decades, with recent developments in fabrication techniques providing new insights. The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory has been a widely accepted explanation for the melting phase transition in 2D systems, but recent studies have challenged this theory. Experimental and simulation results have shown that the transition is first-order or exhibits a single-step transition, contradicting the KTHNY theory's prediction of a continuous transition. The effect of the range of the potential on the 2D melting has been studied, revealing the importance of extended-ranged interatomic potentials for the formation of a stable hexatic phase. The necessary equilibration time for the system to reach equilibrium has been found to be strongly dependent on the measured quantity of interest, with local properties equilibrating rapidly but long-range relaxations taking significantly longer. The observation of the hexatic phase is linked to the thermodynamic equilibration of the system, and extensive microcanonical MD simulations have revealed that the relaxation time of the velocity distribution function can be characterized by an exponential asymptotic formula.

The study also finds that the metallicity distribution for hi column densities peaks around solar values and that the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate and metallicities of DLAs, the luminosities of their host galaxies, and the impact parameters between the centers of host galaxies and the background quasars. The authors conclude that the local galaxy population can explain the properties of DLAs at high redshift as well.

The authors use observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of three young clusters in the nearby galaxy M83. They find that the clusters are not in dynamical equilibrium and are likely to be in a state of ""infant mortality,"" where many young clusters are destroyed due to rapid gas expulsion. The study suggests that this process can lead to an excess of light at large radii in the clusters' surface brightness profiles. The authors use @xmath0-body simulations to model the evolution of the clusters, finding that significant mass loss occurs, but a bound core remains. They also find that escaping stars produce a ""tail"" in the surface brightness profile and contribute to the observed excess light at large radii. The study highlights the importance of considering the effects of gas expulsion on the evolution of young massive star clusters.

The paper investigates the relation between quantum fluctuation, tunneling, and decoherence in a double-well system driven by a polychromatic external field. The authors numerically simulate the time-dependence of the transition probability between the wells and find that the coherent motion of the wave packet remains still up to a certain point, while the semiquantal picture describes the evolution of the centroid motion and the spreading and squeezing of the packet. The degree of coherence is defined to estimate the decoherence of the quantum dynamics, and the transition of the dynamical behavior is divided into three types: coherent, irregular, and transitional motions. The numerical estimation suggests that there are critical values of the perturbation strength depending on the frequency components of the external field, and the tunneling oscillation loses coherence when the perturbation strength exceeds the critical value. The period of the tunneling oscillation is monotonically decreasing as the perturbation strength increases, and the reduction of the tunneling period can be interpreted by applying the floquet theorem to the quasi-energy states and the quasi-energy.

The text discusses the challenges of analyzing longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts, particularly in the context of breast cancer research. The authors propose a Bayesian approach based on a selection model to handle the missing data problem. They account for the within-dyad correlation by introducing dyad-specific random effects into the transition model. The proposed method is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to a breast cancer data set. The results show that the Bayesian approach can handle the nonignorable dropouts and provide accurate estimates of the outcome process. The interdependence structure within dyads makes the missing data problem more challenging, and the proposed method can address this issue by modeling the relationship between the dropout process and missing outcomes using a discrete-time survival model. The authors also consider the nonignorable dropouts in the data analysis to avoid biased results.

The system consists of four modules: detection, local isolation, alert propagation, and software patching. The detection module monitors the connection patterns and traffic volume of p2p hosts to detect active worm attacks. The local isolation module cuts off the links of infected p2p hosts to prevent the worms from spreading. The alert propagation module spreads worm alerts to neighboring phagocytes to enhance the robustness against malicious alert propagations. The software patching module distributes patches to managed p2p hosts to prevent the worms from exploiting vulnerabilities. The system is designed to be scalable and can be deployed in structured p2p overlay networks as well. The paper evaluates the system's performance on a massive-scale testbed with realistic p2p network traces and validates its effectiveness and efficiency.

The authors show that the standard ruler defined by the acoustic oscillations prior to recombination can deal gracefully with uncertainties in the matter density provided that the redshift of matter-radiation equality is well measured. The anisotropies of the CMB have very good leverage on this quantity, and so the acoustic peak method of probing dark energy is robust. The article also highlights the ability of the CMB to constrain the actual matter and radiation densities, and notes that it is likely that the CMB, perhaps in combination with other probes, will be able to constrain the actual matter and radiation densities.

The author shows that the neutrino mass matrix can be brought to real diagonal form via a real rotation, and that the general diagonalizing matrix can be written in a specific form.

The article highlights the puzzling asymmetry between the negative and positive mass cases for the plane source, and the difficulty in understanding the localization of the source. The author proposes to analyze gyroscope experiments to provide additional elements for the interpretation of LC. The LC metric can be written in the form @xmath51, and the components of the four-acceleration of a particle at rest are given by @xmath81. The total precession per revolution of a gyroscope circumventing the axis of symmetry is given by @xmath97, and the expression for @xmath90 is @xmath91. The article also discusses the c-metric, which describes the flat space as seen by an accelerated observer, and the total precession per revolution in the space-time of the c-metric.

The article discusses the problem of determining the properties of a quantum channel, which is essential for any quantum communication protocol. The channel can be described by a completely positive linear map, which transforms a density operator to another density operator. The goal of channel estimation is to specify the parameter vector of the quantum channel, which can be done by measuring the action of the channel on a set of prepared quantum states. The authors propose a protocol for estimating the parameters of a quantum channel, which involves measuring the channel's action on a set of prepared states and deducing an estimated parameter vector. The cost function for comparing two qubit channels is given by the average fidelity error, which is independent of the chosen parametrization. The authors consider the depolarizing channel as an example, which has only one parameter that describes its action. The estimation protocol for the depolarizing channel involves preparing qubits in a pure state and measuring the spin of the qubit received by Bob. The average error of the estimation protocol scales with the available finite resources and vanishes when the channel faithfully preserves the polarization.

The article discusses the localization length of light in one-dimensional disordered metamaterials with negative refractive index. The authors numerically calculate the localization length @xmath0 for a periodic arrangement of layers with index of refraction @xmath1 and thickness @xmath2 alternating with layers of index of refraction @xmath3 and thickness @xmath4. The localization length is found to depend on the wavelength @xmath5 and the disorder parameter @xmath28. For low-disordered systems, the localization length exhibits a quadratic dependence on @xmath5, while for high-disordered systems, it saturates to a constant value. The article also compares the numerical results with previous works and shows that the localization length depends on the position in the band and the disorder. The first gap in the localization length vs. disorder plot is found to be almost independent of the disorder, while the second gap shows a significant dependence. The article highlights the importance of considering disorder in the analysis of metamaterials and the need for further studies to fully understand the effects of disorder on their properties.

The article discusses the mysterious nature of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. The author explains that dark matter is a type of matter that does not emit or reflect light, but its presence can be inferred by its gravitational effects on visible matter. Dark energy, on the other hand, is a mysterious force that is thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe. The author notes that the existence of dark matter and dark energy is supported by a wide range of observational evidence, including the rotation curves of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, the nature of these phenomena remains unknown, and various theories have been proposed to explain their behavior. The author highlights the work of Milgrom, who proposed a modification to the law of gravity to explain the observed rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter. The author also discusses the possibility that dark matter and dark energy may be related, and that they may be manifestations of a more fundamental problem with our understanding of gravity.

The study examines the behavior of quenched polyampholyte (PA) chains in three dimensions, focusing on the effects of charged groups and the transition from a dense to a compact state. The paper uses a combination of analytical arguments, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and enumeration studies to investigate the phase diagrams of PAs in different dimensions. The results show that the PA undergoes a transition from a globular to a compact state as the dimension increases beyond a certain value. The study also finds that the probability of a randomly charged PA to have an excess charge depends on both the dimension and the length of the chain. The paper provides detailed results regarding the energetics and spatial conformations of short PAs and adds further support to previous MC studies. The results also indicate that the compact phase can be destroyed by increasing the net charge, and that the borderline case of the transition is the most controversial. The study concludes that the behavior of PAs in three dimensions is similar to that of randomly charged chains with short-range interactions, and that the crossover occurs only for a narrow interval of charges.

The cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at the Earth from outside, discovered in the early 20th century. The spectrum has been observed as a continuum at all energies, and the highest energy particles are expected to be extragalactic. The discovery of events with energies above 100 EeV (100 billion electronvolts) dates back to the 1960s, and there is little doubt about the non-observation of a Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, with over 17 published events above 100 EeV and five preliminary new events from HiRes. However, the data suggest that the spectrum continues smoothly within the statistical errors, possibly with a change of slope, and the arrival directions of these particles are not found to be pointing to their sources.

The paper discusses the growth and characterization of crystalline MnGe thin films on Si(111) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The films adopt the b20 structure from a thin seedlayer of MnSi prepared prior to MnGe growth. Rheed and AFM investigations reveal that the MnGe thin films consist of islands with a flat surface, which enlarge during growth. The b20 structure was confirmed by XRD, and the lattice parameter was determined to be 1% smaller than in bulk MnGe due to compressive strain imposed by the Si substrate. Although the magnetic properties of MnGe thin films are found to be qualitatively similar to bulk, the ordering temperature is enhanced to 200 K. Compared to MnSi, the helix in MnGe is shorter and more rigid, indicating a magnetic structure related to antiferromagnetism rather than ferromagnetism.

The author provides a detailed explanation of Thurston's algorithm to compute the core entropy for rational angles. The algorithm involves constructing a matrix that represents a linear map, which is defined based on the partition of the circle into two intervals. The matrix is used to compute the leading eigenvalue of its transition matrix, which gives the core entropy. The author also discusses the continuity of the core entropy along principal veins in the Mandelbrot set and along all veins. The paper also provides alternative proofs of monotonicity and continuity of entropy for real maps. The author uses a combinatorial construction to count closed paths in the graph, which bears similarities with the theory of dynamical zeta functions. The method used to count closed paths is an infinite version of the clique polynomial used to study finite directed graphs with small entropy.

However, the so-called ""fireball model"" is still puzzled by the lack of knowledge about the degree of beaming involved in GRBs. The authors point out that the third method for determining the beaming angle, which is based on the observation of orphan afterglows, is not conclusive due to the difficulty in distinguishing between fGRB orphans and jetted GRB orphans. They suggest that there should be many ""failed gamma-ray bursts"" (fGRBs), i.e., baryon-contaminated fireballs with initial Lorentz factor @xmath4, which cannot be observed in gamma rays but can produce orphan afterglows.</summary>

The authors introduce a 2D generalization of the random dimer model (2D-DRDM) and demonstrate its single-particle delocalization properties in the region of the spectrum around the resonance energy. They show that the 2D-DRDM exhibits a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent, and the states around this energy are delocalized. The authors also consider the case of weakly interacting bosons in the presence of the potential and use a Gutzwiller approach to find the ground state wavefunction for a given set of parameters and average number of particles. They find that the minimum of the many-body ground-state IPR as a function of the density is a signature of the resonance induced by the correlations of the disordered potential.

The paper proposes an alternative optical scheme to detect Majorana fermions in iron chains on a superconducting substrate. The scheme uses a coupled hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system with an optical pump-probe scheme. The Majorana signature will be carried out via the coherent optical spectrum of the quantum dot. The interaction between Majoranas in iron chains and the quantum dot is due to the dipole-dipole interaction, and the distance between the two systems can be adjusted by several tens of nanometers. The qdot is considered as a two-level system rather than a single resonant level with spin-singlet state. The exciton resonance spectrum will be significantly enhanced when the qdot is coupled to the nanomechanical resonator, making the Majoranas more sensitive to be detectable. The technique proposed here provides a new platform for applications ranging from robust manipulation of Majoranas and Majorana-based quantum information processing.

The source then entered a quiescent state, with a luminosity consistent with previous measurements. The BeppoSAX and RossiXTE observations revealed a sharp decrease in the source's luminosity around March 5, 1997, which is consistent with an exponential decay.

The outburst evolution of Aql X-1 presents differences compared to low-mass X-ray transients containing black hole candidates. The steepening in the X-ray flux decrease has no clear parallel in low-mass X-ray transients. The source's mass donor star and binary parameters are similar to those of persistent luminosity X-ray binaries. Accretion onto the neutron star surface continues until the centrifugal drag exerted by the corotating magnetosphere on the accreting material is weaker than gravity. The magnetospheric and sonic point beat frequency models cannot explain the QPO peak observed during the outburst. The possibility that accretion onto the neutron star surface takes place even in the quiescent state faces difficulties. The marked steepening in the outburst decay and spectral hardening suggest a transition taking place deep in the gravitational well of the neutron star. Additional information on the neutron star magnetic field and spin can be inferred. The observed ratio of the luminosity when the QPO at 57 Hz was detected and the luminosity when the centrifugal barrier closes is @xmath59. The keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric boundary is equal to the spin frequency, i.e. @xmath60 or @xmath61 Hz for Aql X-1. The BeppoSAX and RossiXTE observations revealed that the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric boundary is",0

The article discusses the explosion model of a Wolf-Rayet star that explains the bolometric and X-ray light curves (LCSs) of supernova (SN) 2006jc. The article presents hydrodynamical and nucleosynthesis calculations, as well as X-ray emission due to the ejecta-circumstellar matter (cSM) interaction. The authors estimate the bolometric luminosity from observations in various wavebands and construct the bolometric LC with the integration of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometries. They also estimate the X-ray luminosity from the Swift and Chandra observations and find that the X-ray contribution to the bolometric luminosity is negligible. The article concludes that the hot carbon dust is newly formed in the SN ejecta and heated by the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co decay, and the luminosity emitted from the hot carbon dust should be included in the bolometric luminosity of SN 2006jc.

The source igr J170913624 is a new X-ray transient binary that was discovered in 2003. It exhibits extreme variability and rapid state changes, similar to those of the black hole binary GRS 1915+105. The source is believed to be a high-inclination binary, with a low or negative spin. The authors attempt to investigate the reasons for the apparent faintness of igr J170913624 by simultaneously fitting spectra at different phases. They use the model cons*phabs*(simpl@xmath13kerrbb) to fit the spectra, with the parameters governing the second-order effects frozen to their default values. The authors vary the black hole mass, inclination angle, and spin, and fit for the mass accretion rate and distance. The results show that the interstellar absorption, power-law index, and scattering fraction vary with phase, while the fit statistic remains relatively constant. The analysis suggests that the faintness of igr J170913624 is due to its low or negative spin.

The paper proposes a new method for encoding a qubit in a triangular quantum dot (TQD) system using a fully electrical control of the symmetry of the TQD. The qubit states are encoded in the doublet subspace, which is immune to decoherence processes. The method involves manipulating the exchange couplings between the spins using local potential gates, which change the bond polarization and covalency between the quantum dots. The qubit states can be controlled by applying electric fields, which modify the superexchange couplings. The proposed method allows for a more straightforward read-out of the qubit state without the need for charge-spin conversion. The method is compatible with existing experimental setup and can be used to perform quantum computations in a more straightforward and efficient manner.

The Z Andromedae binary system consists of a cool giant and a hot compact component. The system has shown unusual activity in the past, including a double outburst in 1984 and 1986. The authors of this paper revisit the system to investigate the physical conditions in the nebulae and their fluctuations during the outburst. They use spectroscopic observations to model the line spectrum and determine the physical parameters of the nebulae. The results show that the outburst is characterized by two different bursts, with the first burst occurring in April 1984 and the second burst in July 1986. The authors also find that the density and velocity of the wind from the cool giant increase during the outburst, indicating that collision of the wind with a shell ejected from the red giant is occurring. The ionization parameter and the temperature of the hot star also increase during the outburst. The authors suggest that the fluctuations in the nebulae are caused by an unexpected disturbing episode, such as the ejection of a new shell from the red giant. The study provides valuable insights into the physical conditions in the nebulae of Z Andromedae during an outburst.

The paper investigates the frequency- and electric field-dependent conductivity of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks. The authors measure the conductivity of SWCNT networks with varying densities using the Corbino reflectometry setup. They find that the onset frequency of the conductance increases with the film thickness, while the length scale decreases. The data of conductance vs. frequency fit well to the extended pair approximation model. The authors also measure the frequency-dependent conductance of ultra-thin sub-monolayer nanotube networks and find that their frequency-dependent conductance also fits well to the extended pair approximation model. The scaling behavior of the conductance and frequency for the samples is investigated, and the correlation length is defined as the distance between connections in the sample. The authors observe that the probed length scale at a given frequency goes as the thickness of the film. The electric field-dependent conductivity of the SWCNT networks is investigated, and the characteristic field at which nonlinear conductivity begins to appear is determined. The length scale of the system is found to depend on the average distance between connections and varies with sample thickness.

The paper discusses the implementation of a three-qubit Grover search algorithm using four-level superconducting qubits in a cavity-QED system. The algorithm is based on a quantum phase gate and two-qubit gates, and it reduces the number of quantum gates required for the search. The paper also considers the effect of spontaneous decay and cavity field decay during the implementation of the algorithm. The three-qubit quantum phase gate is used to induce a phase shift only when all three input qubits are in the desired state, and the combined operator is called the Grover operator. The algorithm is implemented using a series of four steps, including applying a microwave pulse to each squid to change the phase of the target state. The paper shows that the three-qubit Grover search algorithm can be implemented using a simpler circuit diagram than the two-qubit gate decomposition method.

The authors analyze the distribution of SNe in the sky and find a correlation between the magnitudes of SNe and the number density of galaxies in their foreground. They use a sample of 55 SNe with known distances to estimate the global cosmological parameters.

They also show that the CDW state has a 6-sublattice order, which is schematically shown in Fig. [fig:cdw6sub](a). The growth of the order parameter of the CDW state is shown in Fig. [fig:cdw6sub](b), and the resulting phase diagram of the honeycomb lattice is presented in Fig. [fig:cdw6sub](c). The critical value of the second-neighbor Coulomb repulsion for the TMI phase is estimated to be around @xmath63, which is much larger than the value @xmath61 for the CDW state. The energy gain due to the formation of the TMI is found to be much smaller than that for the CDW state.

The paper discusses the application of pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) method in power system long-term stability analysis. PTC is a physically motivated numerical method that can accurately capture the solution of dynamical systems in the early stages, followed by a decrease in the time step size to converge to the steady state. The method is applied to the long-term stability model and the quasi-steady-state (QSS) model, which are used to analyze the stability of power systems. The PTC method is shown to be effective in overcoming numerical difficulties in the QSS model, such as singular Jacobian matrices. The proposed algorithm combines the PTC method with the QSS model to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the stability analysis. The results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the PTC method in power system long-term stability analysis.

The KLM describes a system of localized magnetic moments on a lattice of mobile conduction electrons, and the authors aim to study the ground state properties of the model using dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and lattice quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. The authors show that the KLM exhibits a magnetic order-disorder transition at a critical value of the hopping parameter, which is related to the suppression of particle-hole symmetry. They also demonstrate that the single-particle spectral function of the conduction electrons exhibits a hybridization gap in the paramagnetic phase, which can be used to estimate the coherence temperature. The authors find that the critical value of the hopping parameter overestimates the magnetic order-disorder transition, and that including nesting leads to a shift of the transition to lower values of the hopping parameter. Finally, they present a detailed analysis of the single-particle spectral function in the ground state, which compares well with the exact lattice QMC results.

The simulation shows that the HF wave can excite high-frequency (R-X) and low-frequency (LO) modes in the ionosphere, which can lead to the excitation of electrostatic waves. The simulation also reveals the importance of mode conversion in the ionosphere, where the HF wave can convert from the R-X mode to the LO mode. The paper concludes that the simulation results provide a powerful tool for studying HF-induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation.

The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons in a lattice has been studied using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. The model exhibits a Mott insulator-superfluid transition, which can be observed through the expansion pattern of the atomic cloud. Perturbation theory has been used to improve the Gutzwiller mean-field solution, which describes the short-range correlations between lattice sites. The correlation function has been calculated using perturbation theory and exact diagonalization, revealing the long-range order in the superfluid phase. The results show that the short-range correlations are not well-described by the Gutzwiller approach, and the correlation function exhibits a power-law decay towards zero in the superfluid phase.

The paper presents new photometry of the nearby G-type star Hip 115147 and its companions. The star is found to have a preliminary trigonometric parallax of 23.2 mas, which suggests that it is located at a distance of 23.2 +/- 0.5 mas. The star is identified as a member of the nearby young association TWA, which is estimated to be 16 +/- 2 Myr old. The paper also discusses the possible young age of the star and its companions, based on their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and their similarity to other young stars in the vicinity. The authors suggest that the star may have originated from the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region, based on its proper motion and distance from the center of the Sco-Cen complex. The paper concludes that the star is likely to be older than 16 Myr, based on its position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the lack of a close flyby with another star.

The paper presents a model of dark energy including supersymmetry breaking effects in the dark sector. The model includes a chiral superfield in the dark sector, which couples to both the left-handed lepton doublet and the right-handed neutrino superfield. The scalar and spinor components of the chiral superfield are the acceleron, which causes the present cosmic acceleration, and a sterile neutrino, respectively. The neutrino mass is assumed to be a dynamical field, and the dark energy density is given by the sum of the neutrino energy density and the scalar potential for the acceleron. The paper considers two cases of the neutrino mass matrix: the vanishing mixing case and the finite mixing case. In the vanishing mixing case, only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable on cosmological time scales, while in the finite mixing case, both the masses of the left-handed and a sterile neutrino vary. The paper also discusses the hydrodynamic stability of the dark energy and the effect of supersymmetry breaking on the scalar potential.

The paper discusses the possibility of a light scalar particle, which could be the higgs boson of strong interactions. The authors estimate the mass of the particle based on the average radius for quark-pair creation and observe an interference effect in annihilation data. They also find small flavor-independent oscillations in electron-positron and proton-antiproton annihilation data. The authors suggest that the missing signal in the data could be due to the emission of an unobserved light scalar particle, which they designate as the @xmath30 boson. They also propose the existence of two replicas of the @xmath30 with masses two and three times heavier than the @xmath30. The paper concludes that the data suggest the existence of the @xmath30 boson and its replicas, which could be the higgs bosons of strong interactions.

The paper discusses the problem of estimating a signal in the presence of noise, with a particular focus on the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. The authors propose two schemes for observing the signal and estimate the parameters using the generalized method of moments. They show that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators and provide an example of stochastic resonance. The authors also study the problem of hypotheses testing and apply the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability criterion. They find that the decision rules for their model are similar to those proposed by Chapeau-Blondeau in the i.i.d. setting. The paper concludes by showing that the fisher information quantity is maximized for a specific level of noise, which is the optimal level for the signal to be detected.

The paper discusses the formation of rapidity gaps in high-energy collisions, particularly in hadronic collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN SPS. The authors analyze the data from these collisions and find that the observed rapidity gaps are consistent with the two-gluon exchange model, but with some limitations. The model predicts that the color singlet exchange fraction should decrease with increasing transverse energy of the observed jets. However, the data from the D0 and CDF collaborations at the Tevatron show a different behavior, with the gap fraction increasing with increasing jet pseudorapidity separation. The authors conclude that the non-perturbative nature of the color singlet exchange process makes it difficult to accurately calculate the gap fraction using perturbation theory. They also show that the unitarized gluon exchange model, which includes non-perturbative effects, is able to describe the trend of the data.

The ANN model is trained using historical data from 1994 to 2013 and is able to accurately predict energy consumption for year 2012 and 2013. The performance of the model is evaluated using various error criteria, and the results show that the proposed ANN model can be used to predict future trends of electric energy consumption in the Gaza Strip. The study is the first of its kind in existing literature and demonstrates the relevance of the ANN approach in forecasting electric energy consumption.

The paper discusses the problem of salient object detection in visual scenes, which has attracted significant attention in computer vision community. The authors aim to simulate the remarkable capability of human attention in prioritizing objects for high-level processing. They observe that current models focus on scenes with single objects, but fail to address complex scenes with multiple objects. To address this limitation, they propose a two-stage approach, where the first stage involves selecting objects to process, and the second stage involves segmenting the object area. They also review recent breakthroughs in salient object detection models and highlight the differences between models defining saliency as ""where people look"" and models defining saliency as ""which objects stand out."" The authors argue that an optimal model for fixation prediction should only highlight points that a viewer will look at, while a salient object detection model aims to segment the whole object region, resulting in false positives in fixation prediction and false negatives in salient object detection. They conclude that different evaluation and benchmarks have been developed for comparing models in these two categories.

The TQFT is defined using a multi-pointed triple heegaard diagram, which is a triple heegaard diagram with multiple basepoints.

The paper also discusses the decomposition of the heegaard Floer homology groups into a direct sum over @xmath2-structures on the three-manifold. The authors prove that two triple heegaard diagrams are strongly equivalent if they induce the same map on homology, and they show that a triple heegaard diagram is strongly equivalent to a split one by reducing it to a split diagram and then handlesliding the curves. Finally, the authors prove that the maps from the triple heegaard diagrams are compatible with the isomorphism of the homology groups.

The aim of physics is not only to calculate physical quantities but to understand the underlying phenomena. In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is crucial for understanding the properties of hadrons. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry leads to the appearance of pseudoscalar mesons, which are associated with the order parameter of the broken symmetry. The constituent quarks acquire a dynamical mass due to the non-perturbative gluon and quark-antiquark dressing, which is a moment-dependent quantity. The valence quarks get dressed by the quark condensates and by the meson loops, and the correlated quark-antiquark pairs in the pseudoscalar channel manifest themselves by virtual pseudoscalar mesons. The coupling of the constituent quarks and the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons has the form within the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry. The spin-spin component of the pseudoscalar-exchange interaction arises from the structure of the pseudoscalar-meson constituent quark vertex. The vector-meson field also gives rise to a spin-spin interaction, which is opposite in sign to the yukawa tail and very strong towards short distances.

Each brake body includes a brake actuator operably coupled to an exhaust valve actuator, and a spool valve member movable between an upward, retracted position and a downward, advanced position. The spool valve member defines a high pressure annulus that is always open to a high pressure passage, and a low pressure annulus that can connect an actuation fluid passage to a low pressure passage. When pressure communication passage is fluidly connected to a high pressure manifold, pressure within the spool cavity is high and the spool valve member is preferably hydraulically balanced and maintained in its retracted position. When pressure communication passage is fluidly connected to a low pressure reservoir, pressure within the spool cavity is low, and the high pressure acting on the high pressure surface can overcome the force of the biasing spring and move the spool valve member to its advanced position. As the spool valve member moves, a piston is moved by hydraulic pressure in the actuation fluid passage, and a lash adjuster is operably coupled to the piston via a lash screw to provide sufficient lash to accommodate thermal expansion of the components when the engine warms up.

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for generating supply voltages for display driver circuits at high efficiencies and with low EMI (electromagnetic interference). The invention provides modified switching regulator circuits that cancel out radiated noise by creating multiple paths for current flow. Additional terminal lines are provided to sink any EMI generated in the outermost paths. The invention can be used to drive larger displays, such as those used in Apple iPhone products, without incurring typical penalties associated with EMI or noise. The reduction in EMI is more pronounced by the use of terminal leads, which act as RF antennas to pick up any leaking fields generated by the last fully-connected paths in the circuit.

The Ground Ambulance Services Payment System report was prepared by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in response to a request from the Senate Finance Committee. The report examines the payment system for ground ambulance services provided to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The report finds that the payment system is complex and varies by service area, with urban, rural, and super-rural areas having different payment rates. The median cost per transport for providers in the GAO's sample was $429 in 2010, with a range of $224 to $2,204. The report also finds that providers' costs per transport vary significantly, with level of volunteer staff hours, percentage of Medicare transports that are BLS, percentage of Medicare transports that are super-rural, and level of community tax support being the most important factors. The report concludes that the payment system does not provide adequate incentives for providers to control costs, and that the variability in costs per transport is not well understood. The report makes recommendations for improving the payment system, including the use of a national fee schedule and the consideration of provider characteristics when setting payment rates.

Ginnie Mae is a government agency that operates as a unit of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It was created in 1968 to expand affordable housing in America by linking capital markets to the nation's housing markets. Ginnie Mae provides guarantees to investors by pooling mortgages from various federal agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Rural Housing Service (RHS). These guarantees allow investors to receive timely payments of principal and interest on securities, regardless of whether the borrower makes mortgage payments or the issuer experiences financial difficulties. Ginnie Mae does not buy or sell loans or issue mortgage-backed securities (MBS) directly. Instead, it provides guarantees to issuers, who pool mortgages into MBS and sell them to investors. Ginnie Mae's original MBS program, Ginnie Mae I, requires that all pools contain similar types of mortgages with similar maturities and interest rates. The Ginnie Mae II MBS program permits pools to contain loans with more heterogeneous loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Ginnie Mae's Multiclass Securities Program includes products such as REMICs and Platinum Securities, which allow investors to tailor the prepayment and interest rate risks associated with MBS to their investment goals. Ginnie Mae faces competition from other secondary market entities, such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, but it continues to finance the majority of government-backed loans. Despite this competition, Ginnie Mae's market volume has remained relatively stable over the years, and it continues to play a crucial role in the housing market.

IRS uses nine audit standards to define audit quality, which include the scope, techniques, technical conclusions, reports, and time management of an audit. The audit workpapers provide documentation on the scope of the audit and the diligence with which it was completed. IRS requires group managers to ensure the quality of the audits, leaving much discretion on the frequency and nature of their reviews during an audit. The IRM does not specifically require that all supervisory reviews be documented in the workpapers, although generally accepted government auditing standards do require such documentation. We found limited documentation of supervisory review in the audit workpapers, which raises questions about whether supervisory review is controlling audit quality as intended. Proposed changes to the IRM's sections on examination of returns require documentation of management involvement in the audit process.

The cost of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) is difficult to estimate due to the ongoing nature of the conflict and the various funding sources used by the Department of Defense (DOD). In 2004 and 2005, DOD received approximately $52.4 billion and $62.1 billion, respectively, in supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses. However, the military services also received additional funds through their annual appropriations, which were intended to support GWOT but were not specifically designated for that purpose. DOD and the military services have limited visibility over these funds, and there are no reporting requirements to track how they are used. The gaps between reported obligations and supplemental appropriations for GWOT military personnel and operation and maintenance expenses varied by service, with the Army and Air Force using transfer authorities to cover some of the gaps.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is primarily funded by the Trust Fund, which receives revenues from excise taxes on airline tickets, fuel, and other aviation-related activities. The administration has proposed changes to the funding structure to better align costs with revenues, including establishing direct user charges for commercial aviation and substantially increasing fuel taxes for general aviation. The proposal also calls for an advisory board to make recommendations on fee setting and limited authority for FAA to use debt financing. The current funding structure has successfully funded a growing FAA budget, and excise tax revenues are projected to increase substantially at current rates. However, some factors that drive tax revenues, such as ticket prices, are not well linked to FAA's workload and costs, raising concerns about revenue adequacy, equity, and efficiency. The proposal to fund AIP through equal fuel taxes on all aircraft operators is intended to address equity concerns, but the distribution of the funding burden among user groups may not be fair. Commercial aviation users currently pay for a large share of benefits that come from capital spending at general aviation airports, and some portion of these benefits may accrue to commercial aviation users. The proposal to establish equal tax rates for commercial and general aviation operators was made to achieve fairness and simplicity. The administration's reauthorization proposal also calls for changing FAA's budget structure to align with its lines of business and proposed funding.

The document provides an overview of the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) in Afghanistan, which is a unique program that differs from other DoD programs due to its focus on development and reconstruction rather than neglected or damaged infrastructure. The program has evolved over time, with an increase in the number of complex projects and a higher cost. The program is managed by the Combined Joint Task Force-101 (CJTF-101), which is responsible for executing and managing the program. The program has faced challenges in providing adequate management and oversight due to insufficient personnel, leading to problems with project documentation, adherence to guidelines, and project tracking. The program requires additional personnel at brigade levels to perform essential functions, including project monitoring and oversight, consulting subject-matter experts, and conducting staff assistance visits. The lack of subject-matter experts poses a risk to the program's ability to identify and correct poor contractor performance, which could affect the cost, completion, and sustainability of CERP projects. The program's personnel have received little or no training on their duties and responsibilities, which has led to difficulties in contracting and oversight. The program's training is inadequate, and PPOs have less training but more authority under CERP, while warranted contracting officers have more experience and training before they can award contracts. Inadequate training has led to common mistakes in CERP contracts and project files, such as omitting key contract clauses or including clauses that are not appropriate. The lack of training affects the quality of oversight provided and can increase the risk of fraud.

The article discusses the importance of program evaluations in the federal government, particularly in the 24 agencies governed by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. Evaluations are crucial in assessing program performance, identifying areas for improvement, and informing decision-making. However, the 2013 and 2017 surveys of federal managers revealed that many agencies lack access to recent evaluations, and managers often lack awareness of evaluations conducted by others. Despite this, managers who had access to evaluations reported that they contributed significantly to improving program management and understanding. Evaluations can also help allocate resources within programs, support budget requests, and measure complex or costly forms of performance. However, the process of influencing change through evaluation can be iterative and complex, requiring multiple studies to occur. To address this, federal agencies use various methods to disseminate evaluation findings to local decision-makers. Overall, the article highlights the need for improved coordination and collaboration in federal programs, as well as the importance of using evaluation evidence to inform decision-making.",1

Both mutual funds and banks are financial intermediaries that raise funds from savers and invest them in the economy.
Mutual funds do not make loans, but they invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks.
The funds' investments become a source of new finance to the economy, and the securities markets play a crucial role in this process.
The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds has had a significant impact on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy.
The deposit-to-GDP ratio has been pushed down by a number of factors, including a downsizing of the savings-institution industry, a decline in loans at commercial banks, and a shift by banks into greater use of nondeposit funding sources.
The Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry Association (SIA) agree that mutual funds have attracted significant amounts of money that otherwise might have been placed in bank deposits.
The total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990 through 1994 were $1,067 billion.
Using the ratio of deposits to GDP as a benchmark, the total impact of mutual funds on deposits may have been sizable but probably less than $700 billion.

473,"  The Single Audit Act of 1984 was passed to improve the federal government's oversight of grants given to state and local governments. The act established a single audit concept to replace multiple grant audits with a single audit of an entity's entire financial system. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the act and expanded uniform audit requirements to cover all federal grant recipients. The act assigned responsibilities to various entities, including OMB, federal agencies, and their respective Offices of Inspector General (OIG). The auditor of the grant recipient is required to perform the audit in accordance with GAGAS. A single audit consists of an audit and opinions on the fair presentation of financial statements and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA), as well as testing of internal control and compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements. The PCIE study found that approximately 49% of single audits reviewed were unacceptable or had limited reliability, with deficiencies including lack of evidence of internal control testing and compliance testing for most or all compliance requirements.",0
474,"  The Medicare program was created in 1965 and has since used health insurers to process and pay claims. However, the program's contracting structure has limited competition and innovation, leading to dwindling numbers of insurers willing to serve as Medicare contractors. The Social Security Act and implementing regulations restrict the program's ability to contract with entities other than health insurers, limiting the program's ability to use competitive contracting to improve performance. The program could benefit from various contracting reforms, such as allowing Medicare to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis and allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions. The program also faces challenges in terminating contractors, as the Social Security Act limits the agency's ability to terminate intermediaries and carriers. Implementing performance-based contracting will require significant time and care to effectively promote better performance and accountability, and eliminating contractors' ability to unilaterally terminate contracts will help address challenges the agency faces in finding replacement contractors on short notice.",1

In 1993, both Congress and the administration agreed that federal employment levels should be cut. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to develop strategic plans, measure their performance, and submit annual reports on program performance. Five components were selected for review: HUD's Office of Housing, GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS), DOI's Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), NASA's Human Space Flight Program, and OPM's Investigations Service. The downsizing of these components ranged from 2% to 100%. To maintain performance, components took steps such as refocusing their missions, reengineering work processes, and building and maintaining employee skills. Limited customer survey data was available, but customers generally supported the view that performance had been maintained. Officials and employees believed that efforts to maintain performance had been successful, but some expressed concern about maintaining performance with additional downsizing. The lessons learned by components included the importance of open communication and soliciting employee input in the planning process.",0

JWST is designed to observe the universe in infrared light, with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, and will study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe. The telescope consists of several elements and major subsystems, including the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and the spacecraft. JWST faces significant technical challenges and risks, including the development of a cryogenic cooler to cool the infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin, and the integration and testing of the various elements and subsystems. The project has experienced significant delays and cost overruns, and the baseline funding does not reflect the most probable cost with adequate reserves in each year of project execution, resulting in an unexecutable project. NASA has replanned the project and placed a cap on the formulation and development costs, but the project remains at risk of technical challenges and schedule delays. The project has used schedule reserve to address various technical problems that have arisen, including issues with the ISIM and OTE elements, and workmanship issues with the cryogenic harnesses that connect to the mirrors. Various spacecraft challenges have also used up schedule reserve.

The document highlights that while there are regulations in place to secure other critical infrastructure sectors, such as water and transportation, chemical facilities are not subject to the same level of security requirements. The document notes that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is developing a plan to protect the chemical sector, which will include a framework for reducing the overall vulnerability of the sector in partnership with the industry and state and local authorities. DHS has initiated actions to identify critical assets, prioritize facilities, and develop and implement protective programs. The document also mentions that industry associations have been active in promoting security among member companies, but the extent of participation in the industry's voluntary initiatives is unclear. The document concludes that DHS lacks specific authority to address security concerns at chemical facilities and that legislation is needed to give the federal government greater authority over chemical facility security.

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires federal agencies to protect personal information in systems of records. The Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002 address the protection of personal privacy in federal agencies. The Privacy Act defines a ""system of records"" as a group of records maintained by an agency that contains personal information about an individual. The E-Government Act requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments (PIAs) before developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates personal information. The Chief Privacy Officer at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for ensuring that personal privacy is protected in DHS programs. DHS has developed a data mining tool called ADVISE, which is being considered for several different applications within the department. However, DHS did not conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) for ADVISE, which could have identified privacy risks and mitigated them. The TSA's passenger prescreening program, Secure Flight, has faced privacy problems, including the collection of personal information from commercial sources without fully informing the public. TSA has added privacy experts to its development teams to address privacy issues as they arise. DHS is planning to spend about $9 million on acquiring personal information from information resellers in fiscal year 2005. The agency's practices for handling this information do not always reflect the Fair Information Practices, and there is a lack of agency policies that specifically address the use of personal information from resellers.

The text discusses the use of franchise funds by the Department of Defense (DOD) to obtain contracting services. Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting businesses that provide common administrative services to other government agencies. DOD uses two franchise funds, GovWorks and FedSource, to obtain contracting services. GovWorks provides contracting services to DOD customers, while FedSource provides contracting services to DOD programs. The text highlights several issues with the use of franchise funds, including:

1. Limited competition: The text finds that GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures and did not ensure fair and reasonable prices for goods and services.
2. Lack of price analysis: The text finds that GovWorks and FedSource did not always perform price analyses to ensure that prices were fair and reasonable.
3. Non-competitive awards: The text finds that GovWorks and FedSource awarded contracts non-competitively, which may have resulted in higher prices for goods and services.
4. Inadequate justifications: The text finds that justifications for non-competitive awards were inadequate or lacking in some cases.
5. Lack of transparency: The text finds that FedSource did not provide contractors with a fair opportunity to submit offers and have their offers fairly considered for work under multiple-award contracts.

The American economy experienced significant changes in the mid-1970s, leading to increased unemployment and dislocation of workers. In response, the US government implemented worker profiling to identify and provide reemployment services to those most likely to exhaust their unemployment benefits. Under worker profiling, states are required to identify claimants who are most likely to exhaust benefits and refer them to reemployment services. States use statistical models or characteristic screens to identify claimants who are most likely to exhaust benefits. Labor recommends using five variables in statistical models to predict exhaustion, including industry, job search, and education. However, many states have not updated their models in recent years, leading to a loss of predictive accuracy. Labor has taken various actions to encourage and assist states in updating their models, but has not established requirements for doing so. A recent survey found that many states have not updated their models in recent years, with some states not updating their models since 1999 or before.

The GAO (Government Accountability Office) conducted an undercover operation to test the security of the US-Canada border by attempting to transport radioactive sources across the border. Two teams of investigators, posing as employees of a fictitious company, purchased small amounts of radioactive sources from commercial sources and attempted to transport them across the border. The investigators also produced counterfeit NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) documents and used them to pass through border checkpoints. At both checkpoints, the CBP (Customs and Border Protection) inspectors did not question the validity of the counterfeit documents and allowed the investigators to enter the country. The GAO found that the CBP inspectors did not follow proper procedures for verifying the authenticity of NRC documents and that the amount of radioactive sources that could be purchased and transported across the border poses a significant security risk. The GAO recommended that the NRC take steps to address these vulnerabilities and improve the security of the border.

The banking industry plays a central role in the US economy, extending credit and taking on liabilities. Banking regulations, including capital requirements and risk weighted ratios, aim to ensure banks are safely profitable and reduce losses in case of failure. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel Accords have introduced stricter regulations, including the Volcker Rule, to address weaknesses in the financial system. Banks must hold a minimum level of capital, liquidity, or stable funding to absorb losses and meet regulatory ratio requirements. The leverage ratio and risk-weighted ratio are used to calculate capital ratios, with the risk-weighted ratio taking into account the riskiness of assets. Some argue that using both ratios is necessary, while others believe that risk-weighted ratios should be limited due to potential inaccurate risk estimation. Prudential regulation includes requirements beyond capital ratios, such as liquidity requirements and asset concentration guidelines. The benefits of prudential regulation, including increased safety and stability, may outweigh costs such as reduced credit availability and slower economic growth. Congress may consider reducing regulatory reliance on risk-weighted ratios or changing risk weights assigned to asset classes. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits depository banks from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund. Proponents argue that proprietary trading adds risk to commercial banking and moral hazard is problematic with taxpayer-backed deposits. However, some doubt the necessity of the Volcker Rule, arguing that it did not play a direct role in the financial crisis.

The Supreme Court decided four search and seizure cases during its October 2012 term, including Florida v. Jardines, which involved whether an alert by a trained narcotics-detection dog at the front door of a suspected grow house is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause. The Court held that it is, and the Florida Supreme Court's decision to the contrary was affirmed. The case was notable for its discussion of the use of drug-sniffing dogs and the question of whether such use constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. The Court observed that the use of a drug-sniffing dog at the front door of a private home is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and that the police must have probable cause to conduct such a search. The Court also noted that the use of a drug-sniffing dog does not transform a lawful traffic stop into a search, but rather the dog sniff conducted during the traffic stop may reveal information other than the location of a substance that no individual has a right to possess. The Florida Supreme Court's decision in Jardines was not surprising given its earlier decision in Harris, which refused to accept a trained dog's positive reaction as per se probable cause to search a vehicle. The Court held that the fact that a drug-detection dog has been trained and certified to detect narcotics, standing alone, is not sufficient to demonstrate the reliability of the dog and establish probable cause to conduct a search. Probable cause exists when there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place, and this assessment is made based on a totality of the circumstances. The Court has held that bare, conclusionary statements to a magistrate that officers have reliable information from a credible source without indicating why the tip is reliable or the source credible do not constitute probable cause. The Court has also held that an informant's tip may serve as the basis for probable cause only with evidence of the information's reliability and tipster's credibility.

High risk pools are designed to assist individuals who cannot access health insurance in the private market due to pre-existing health conditions. These pools were established in the mid-1970s and have been expanded and reauthorized by Congress several times. Currently, 35 states have high risk pools, which are operated through state-established nonprofit organizations. Premiums for high risk pools are capped at 150-200% of standard risk rates, and states may augment premium collection with assessments on insurers, general revenue, and other sources. High risk pools generally operate at a loss, and federal grants have been provided to states to help offset operating expenses. Enrollment in high risk pools varies significantly across states, with an average enrollment of around 4,000 participants. The federal government has provided financial assistance to states through seed grants and operational grants to establish and operate high risk pools. The Trade Act of 2002 authorized and appropriated $80 million to defray operating losses experienced by states with existing high risk pools. Nineteen states were awarded operational grants in FY2003, and 22 states were awarded grants in FY2004.

The Take Care Clause limits the President's role in the legislative process and ensures that the President and executive branch officials comply with and execute clear statutory directives. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the President has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend or disregard laws, and that the Clause imposes a duty on the President to execute the law. The Court has also rejected the President's claimed authority to block the execution of validly enacted statutes through executive action or nonenforcement. The judicial branch has limited the President's discretion in enforcing federal law, and the Take Care Clause has contributed to the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. The Clause has been invoked in controversies over the President's nonenforcement of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Controlled Substances Act.

The federal government has increasingly played a role in helping to prevent and recover missing adult incidents, particularly among vulnerable populations. The Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return program provides a MedicAlert bracelet or other form of identification to enrolled individuals with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, which includes a toll-free emergency response number. The Kristen's Act grant program provided funding for a national clearinghouse and resource center for missing adults, but authorization expired in FY2006. H.R. 632 would reauthorize the grant at $4 million for each of FY2010 through FY2020 and direct the Attorney General to establish a national ""Silver Alert communications network"" to assist regional and local search efforts for missing seniors. Eleven states have alert systems for missing adults, including Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia. The state alert systems were authorized either by law or executive order, with most states passing a law to create the alert system for missing adults. The administration of state alert systems for missing vulnerable adults appears to be a cooperative effort among state and local law enforcement agencies. The 11 states have different methods for activating alerts, including filing an actionable missing persons report, meeting certain criteria, and using a toll-free emergency response number. Some states have also established interstate coordination protocols for alert systems to coordinate with other states when an eligible missing person is believed to have crossed state lines. The use of state alert systems for missing adults varies, with some states providing data on the number of alerts activated and costs associated with the system, while others do not.

The largest federal facilities are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the US Army Corps of Engineers, which supply water to millions of people. Bioterrorism or chemical attacks could deliver widespread contamination, and cyber attacks could disrupt water utility systems. Water infrastructure system designers, managers, and operators have long prepared for extreme events, but the 9/11 attacks changed the focus to include manmade threats. Federal dam operators have implemented security measures, and local utilities have emergency plans to address terrorist threats.

President Obama faced tension with Congress over appointments to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and National Labor Relations Board.

The appointments were controversial, and their legality was challenged in court. The Constitution's Recess Appointments Clause authorizes the President to fill vacancies during recess, but the duration of the appointment and the authority of the appointee are unclear. The President's appointments during a three-day recess between pro forma sessions raised legal questions, and a court challenge is possible.

Coverage varies by state, with some states covering nearly all employees, while others cover less than half. In recent years, there have been proposals to mandatorily cover newly hired state and local government employees in Social Security. Proponents argue that this would simplify retirement planning and provide better benefit protections for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions. Opponents argue that mandatory coverage would not necessarily result in better benefit protections, as state and local governments could reduce pension benefits to keep costs down.

The report provides a chronology of events related to North Korea's nuclear weapons program in 2005. The year saw little progress in resolving the issue, with adjustments made to senior U.S. officials in charge of policy in East Asia. North Korea escalated security tensions through words and actions, including announcing it had nuclear weapons and suspending its participation in the Six-Party Talks. The talks resumed in July with a joint statement of principles agreed upon by all parties, including North Korea's commitment to abandoning its nuclear weapons program. However, the agreement was short-lived as North Korea claimed it would only return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty after receiving light-water reactors from the U.S. The U.S. dismissed the claim, and tensions between Washington and Pyongyang intensified. Human rights concerns also emerged as a prominent issue, with the appointment of a Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea and increased U.S. sanctions on North Korean counterfeit currency. South Korea and China distanced themselves from U.S. accusations regarding North Korean illegal activities, and China took some steps to curb such activity. The U.S. also warned financial institutions of potential risks from dealing with North Korea.

The study investigated the removal of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), from the circulation of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) using continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The study used a standard clinical CVVH circuit and filter to remove EVs from a modeled patient's circulation. The results showed that CVVH effectively removed EVs from the patient's circulation, with 50% of clearance occurring within the first 30 minutes of dialysis. The decline in EV levels was rapid, with the majority of clearance occurring within the first hour of dialysis. The study used flow cytometry to characterize and quantify EVs based on CD31- and annexin V- positivity occurring in a size gate less than 1 m. The results showed that CVVH removed EVs from the patient's circulation, with a fraction of EVs remaining in the circulation after dialysis. The study used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the size distribution of EVs, which showed that EVs were removed from the circulation and did not pass through the CVVH filter. The study concluded that CVVH is a meaningful therapeutic intervention in AKI due to the clearance of EVs from the patient's circulation.

The article discusses the use of antireflection (AR) technology in high-efficiency solar cells. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures are proposed as a promising AR material due to their wide bandgap and ability to trap light. The article presents results of experiments on the growth of ZnO nanowhiskers (NWs) on the surface of silicon solar cells using a two-step seeding and growth process. The density and length of ZnO NWs are optimized for improved solar cell performance. The article shows that ZnO NWs can reduce the reflectivity of solar cells in a large spectral range, leading to improved external quantum efficiency. The growth time of ZnO NWs affects their density and length, with longer NWs resulting in higher reflectivity. The article also notes that long-time immersion of solar cells in aqueous solution during ZnO NW growth can deteriorate cell performance. The work is supported by several funding agencies.

647,"  The use of endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DX/HA) copolymer for the treatment of pediatric vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has expanded as an alternative to open surgery. The operative ease and short recovery time of the technique have popularized it with surgeons and parents. The reported success rates of DX/HA injection vary significantly, with some institutions reporting higher success rates than others. Introduced to detect occult VUR, pic cystography has been found to be 100% sensitive and 91% specific in identifying VUR. However, the correlation between intraoperative and postoperative cystograms is only 80%, suggesting that DX/HA deposits may migrate medially and towards the bladder neck, leading to long-term failure. Intraoperative pic cystography can detect de novo VUR in patients with preoperative unilateral VUR, preventing postoperative contralateral new onset of VUR. While DX/HA injection success rates range between 75-80%, the addition of intraoperative cystograms cannot replace postoperative studies.",0
648,"  The accuracy of fetal MRI in detecting central nervous system pathology depends on the expertise of the sonographer and the limitations of the imaging technique. Fetal MRI has a limited role in assessing the size of cerebral ventricles except in cases where fetal position and calvarial ossification cause problems. In the second trimester, MRI is useful in detecting small foci of brain hemorrhage or callosal anomalies in fetuses diagnosed with cerebral ventriculomegaly. Later in pregnancy, MRI adds information about normal and pathological cortical development and maturation, detects white matter pathology, and depicts fossa posterior anomalies. Referring prenatal cases of ventriculomegaly for fetal MRI is a topic of debate due to questions related to the diagnostic accuracy of MRI and practical issues such as availability, cost, and expertise of fetal radiologists. MRI is a sensitive technique for detecting intraventricular hemorrhage and corpus callosum dysgenesis, and it allows for a good evaluation of the vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, pedunculi, brainstem, 4th ventricle, tentorium cerebelli, and retrocerebellar space.",1

The study compared the effect of different smear layer removal methods on the bond strength of self-adhesive cement to dentin. The methods included sodium hypochlorite, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and photodynamic diode laser. The results showed that the higher bond strength values were obtained for the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups. The study rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that different smear layer removal methods affect the bond strength of a fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin. The authors suggested that the smear layer should be removed according to some authors' recommendations to increase the antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness. The study also found that the photodynamic diode laser group showed post-cement failure, while the other groups showed mixed failures. The authors concluded that the removal of the smear layer and formation of the resin-dentine interdiffusion zone are important for post restoration success.

The human microbiome project has begun to bear fruit, with international consortia and collaborations established to characterize the microbial communities of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies have shown that there is a common core of bacterial species shared among all or most individuals, but there are also significant variations between individuals. The minimal gut microbiome and minimal gut metagenome are not mutually exclusive, and there are many genes that belong to both groups. Enterotypes, a relatively new concept, have been identified based on the combination of bacterial species present in each individual. The enterotype is associated with specific properties and functions, and may be influenced by the individual's immune system, nutritional input during early childhood, lifestyle, and exposure to other gut microbial ecologies. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of enterotypes in gut health and disease susceptibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 individuals and can be diagnosed in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Patients with ADPKD may experience worsening of renal functions during pregnancy, but the pathophysiology is unknown.
One hypothesis suggests that increased glomerular perfusion during pregnancy causes further injury to the kidneys in patients with preexisting impairment of function.
Pregnant women with ADPKD may have increased proteinuria and a higher risk of developing dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease.
Our patient presented with symptoms of renal insufficiency only in the seventh month of gestation, making it difficult to determine whether the disease progressed during pregnancy or was missed earlier.
Blood erythrocyte count and hematocrit may be increased in ADPKD patients due to abnormal erythropoietin production by cysts, but they do not have severe anemia.
Hypertension is a common symptom in ADPKD patients, occurring in approximately 60% of cases due to stretching of arterioles across expanding cysts.
During pregnancy, early dialysis is recommended to treat patients with ADPKD, and more frequent and longer hemodialysis sessions may be necessary.
Problems occurring in pregnant patients on hemodialysis include vascular access, cardiovascular instability, large fluid and electrolyte shifts, and risk of hepatitis.
Fetal heart rate monitoring is recommended during hemodialysis to detect redistribution of arterial flow away from the uteroplacental vascular bed.
Blood levels of coagulation factors are associated with a shortening of the prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time during pregnancy.

The study analyzed the lactation curve of indigenous and exotic cows in India, focusing on the persistency of lactation and the impact of mastitis on milk production. The data was collected over 12 years and included 11728 test-day milk yields from 733 Karan Fries cows. The results showed that the peak milk yield occurred in the 4th parity for both normal and mastitis cows, and the fadmy milk yield in the 4th parity was maximum compared to other parities. The study also found that the initial milk yield was lower in the first parity, and the peak milk yield took more time to attain in the first parity compared to subsequent parities. The decline in persistency of lactation with increase in parity order was observed, and the lower initial and peak milk yield in the first parity and more time to attain peak yield were in agreement with previous reports. The study suggested that the lactation curve parameters can be used in selection schemes, and the high persistency is associated with a slow rate of decline in milk yield after peak production.

The study investigated the effect of NDGA on the lifespan and body weight of mice. Mice were fed NDGA at different doses (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.5 g/kg diet) beginning at 12 months of age. The study found that median lifespan was extended by 12% in mice fed 373 mg/kg bw/d of NDGA. The dose that extended median lifespan was within 12% of the dose that initially reported to extend the lifespan of NIH-ITP mice. Food consumption and body weight were monitored throughout the study, and the mice ate essentially all their food each day. The study used an unbalanced statistical design to minimize the number of mice per test group while maintaining statistical power. The weights of the mice were analyzed using a mixed effects model with a Bayesian information criterion. The results suggest that the weights of the 2.5 g/kg diet group were significantly different than those of the controls.

Myosin Va is a molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along actin filaments.
The motor consists of a dimerized head, a coiled-coil rod, and a c-terminal cargo-binding domain.
The motor's processivity is regulated by its conformational change upon ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by lever arms.
The lever arms are composed of six tandem helices, stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin-like light chains.
Calmodulin dissociation from the lever arm reduces the motor's processivity in high calcium conditions.
The structural domains responsible for myosin Va's maneuverability have not been fully characterized but may reside in the lever arm or coiled-coil junction.
Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to measure the flexural stiffness of myosin Va constructs expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells.
The myosin Va constructs were coexpressed with calcium-insensitive calmodulin or wild-type calmodulin, and their flexural stiffness was analyzed.
The results showed that the flexural stiffness of myosin Va constructs was dependent on the presence of calmodulin and the length of the lever arms.

The study examined the forms of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and their correlation with CD4+ cell counts in HIV patients. The study was conducted over a two-year period and included 50 HIV patients. The majority of patients were male (90%) and the median age was 39 years. The majority of patients (76%) were contaminated with HIV through sexual transmission, while 22% were infected through sharing of intravenous needles. The study found that Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species in OPC, followed by Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata. The study also found that the majority of OPC lesions (73%) occurred in patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm. The study suggests that current guidelines for the treatment of OPC with fluconazole are acceptable and do not lead to resistance. The study concludes that oral candida colonization and invasive infection occur more frequently in HIV-positive patients and are significantly more common in patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200 cells/mm.

The study investigated the levels of vaspin and adiponectin in patients with renal insufficiency and type 2 diabetes. The results showed that the serum vaspin levels were not significantly different between patients with renal insufficiency and those without, despite previous studies suggesting that vaspin levels are elevated in diabetic patients. However, the serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes than in those without. The study also found that the serum adiponectin levels were related to age, blood pressure, and other factors in both groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the level of HbA1c was independently associated with vaspin concentration in the total subjects. The study suggests that measuring the levels of adipokines in patients with renal insufficiency may be beneficial for predicting cardiovascular events and patient survival.

The study included 190 patients with Wagner grades 3 and 4 ulcers, with a median age of > 60 years, median ulcer size of 22 cm (75% > 10 cm), and lesions were 57% ischemic. The study used several surrogate variables to assess complete healing, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and eot (median, 5 weeks). The study found that rhegf treatment was associated with a significant increase in the area of granulation tissue covering the wound area and a decrease in the time to complete healing. The study also found that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was maximized when using the granulation tissue covering the wound area as the surrogate variable. The study used product coefficient to quantify the contribution of the surrogate variable to the final outcome, and the proportion mediated and its 95% CI were used to assess the association between the surrogate variable and the final outcome. The study found that the granulation variable percent of granulation tissue covering the ulcer area (> 75% or not) was the most relevant surrogate variable for complete healing.

Schwannomas of the vidian canal are rare tumors that can cause significant morbidity due to direct involvement of nerves or local mass effect. There have been only 4 reported cases of vidian nerve schwannomas in the literature, with symptoms including headaches, facial pain, and nasal dryness. The patient in this case had a biopsy-proven vidian nerve schwannoma incidentally identified on MRI, with no symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Surgical resection or radiation therapy are the traditional and curative management options for peripheral nerve tumors, with recent advancements in transnasal endoscopic skull base approaches enabling complete resection. Conservative management is also an option when surgical resection is not feasible or involves a disproportionate risk of postsurgical morbidity and/or mortality. The choice of treatment depends on patient choice, functional status, presenting symptoms, tumor location, tumor volume, and malignant potential. In this case, the patient decided to pursue radiation therapy. Single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or multiple-fraction radiation therapy are options for treatment, with SRS being a well-tolerated procedure and fractionated radiation offering a safer means of delivering radiation when there are concerns for late effects. Endoscopic biopsy can be used to confirm a histopathologically benign diagnosis before considering treatment options.

The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut during embryonic development.
A tornwaldt's cyst develops if the embryonic remnant becomes obstructed, leading to cystic nasopharyngeal bursitis.
Crust-type nasopharyngeal bursitis is a less common type that presents with retching, expectoration of crusts, and occipital pain.
The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is more common and can be distinguished from a retention lymphoid cyst by its epithelial lining.
Histopathologically, the crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis appears as reactive lymphoid mucosa with necrotic tissue.
The crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis may produce no symptoms other than retching and irritative expectoration of crusts.
Awareness of the crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is important for proper referrals between generalists, pulmonologists, and otolaryngologists.
Endoscopic examination with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is the best method for clinical assessment.
Nasopharyngeal bursitis should be differentiated from nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which can mimic the ulcerative nature of nasopharyngeal bursitis.
Endoscopic interruption of the bursa with electrocauterization at the base is a minimally invasive technique that can suffice for treatment.
In conclusion, the crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis is a distinct variant that may develop at any time without recognized predisposing factors.

The incidence of melanoma skin cancer has been increasing over the past few decades. Dermatoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that enables the visualization of morphological features of pigmented skin lesions. Dermatoscopy can improve the diagnosis of melanoma by 1030%. However, the diagnosis is highly dependent on subjective judgment and is difficult to reproduce. Automated analysis of digitized images obtained by dermatoscopy can assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions. Several algorithms have been proposed for the classification of skin lesions, including border detection, feature extraction, and classification. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using various measures, such as lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification accuracy. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of imaging modality used and the specific application. Multimodal systems that combine different imaging technologies can improve the ability to detect melanoma at an earlier stage and reduce the trauma of diagnostic procedures. Preprocessing techniques, such as color space transformation, color quantization, contrast enhancement, and artifact removal, are used to reduce the ill effects of dermatoscopic images and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. These techniques include image resizing, masking, cropping, hair removal, and conversion from RGB color to intensity grey image.

The study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and determinants of partial remission (PR) in type 1 diabetes. The study included 242 children aged 0.9 to 16.4 years, followed up from diagnosis to adulthood. PR was defined as an HbA1c level of < 7% during the first year after diagnosis, and the study found that 56.2% of patients experienced PR. The study also found that PR duration was significantly shorter in patients with a higher baseline HbA1c level, and that anti-GAD65 and anti-IA2 antibody titers positively correlated with HbA1c levels at 2 years after diagnosis. The study suggests that HbA1c levels at 3 months may be used to estimate the proportion of patients that will experience PR for more than 1 year.

Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that primarily affects the epiphyseal regions of the long bones, especially the ends of the tibia, femur, and humerus.
It is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells and cystic areas.
The diagnosis of chondroblastoma can be challenging due to its similarity to other tumors such as giant cell tumor, chondrosarcoma, and aneurismal bone cyst.
Immunohistochemical examination of the tumor cells can help differentiate chondroblastoma from these other tumors.
The treatment of chondroblastoma in the temporal bone requires total en bloc excision, curettage, and irradiation.
Postoperative irradiation has been observed to cause malignant changes in chondroblastoma.
Total en bloc excision should be the first choice as a therapeutic approach for chondroblastoma in the temporal bone, especially when located near important neurovascular components.
Accurate and early diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment.
For patients with later-stage chondroblastoma, a modified surgical procedure can be a valuable alternative.
In conclusion, chondroblastoma is a rare and challenging tumor to diagnose and treat, but early and accurate diagnosis and surgical intervention can improve outcomes.

The study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDI diagnosis using EIA and found that 39% of the specimens were positive for toxins, while 29% were negative for toxins but positive for C. difficile growth on culture. The study found that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens had shorter diarrhea duration than those with toxin-positive stool specimens. However, there was no significant difference in diarrhea duration between patients with toxin-negative stool specimens and those with both toxin-negative stool specimens and isolates. The study also found that patients who tested positive for C. difficile on culture but negative for toxins in their stool had milder symptoms than those with toxin-positive stool specimens. The study supported previous reports that patients with toxin-negative stool specimens present with milder clinical symptoms than those with toxin-positive stool specimens.

Microbial communities differ from monocultures in terms of the toxins they degrade, the natural products they produce, and even their capacity to grow in certain environments. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism must extend from the properties of individual strains in pure culture to the combinatorial interactions supported by complex communities. Interacting partners share metabolites, such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose, and each pair of auxotrophs can complement each other's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites. Theoretical and empirical precedents have established that metabolic cooperation is enhanced at intermediate cell densities when the concentration of cross-fed metabolites is sufficiently high to improve cooperative fitness. The growth of a given strain relates to its level of cooperation, and cooperation levels can be quantified using the derived value of cb. Correlations of the cooperation profiles indicate the overall similarity of the cooperative behavior between two strains, and analysis of smit interactions can identify biosynthetic modules. Metabolic network stoichiometries can be applied to infer biochemical reaction rates through flux balance analysis, and the joint flux model was effective in reproducing the observation that mutants in shared pathways generally do not supplement each other's growth. The likelihood of a given metabolite being shared should depend on the growth value of that metabolite to both the donor and recipient strain, and shadow prices can be derived to predict the value of each exchanged metabolite for each mutant strain in the system. The predicted efficiency of cooperation, , was more predictive than either b or p alone in determining the growth of strain a.

A 71-year-old woman was evaluated for the progressive development of asymptomatic lesions on her scalp and forehead. Physical examination showed multiple rounded skin-colored or erythematous papules, and excisional biopsies revealed spiradenomas except for one cylindroma. The patient's family history revealed multiple affected family members, including her mother, brother, and two daughters. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous mutation in the cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) on chromosome 16q12q13. This mutation was found in all affected family members, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The late onset of symptoms and relatively low number of tumors in the patient may support the hypothesis that the final phenotype is influenced by both germline and somatic mutations. The authors recommend genetic counseling for the patient's family members and periodic follow-up to monitor for any new tumors.

Our understanding of the role of Helicobacter pylori in gastric cancer has been shaped by the work of three pathologists: Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren. Virchow, a 19th-century Prussian physician-scientist, hypothesized that cancer arose from normal cells in response to chronic inflammation. Correa, a Colombian pathologist, devoted his career to understanding the etiology of gastric cancer, and in 1975, he published a model for gastric cancer development. Warren, an Australian pathologist, discovered that H. pylori was a key factor in gastric cancer development, and his work was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005. Correa's subsequent work focused on the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer, and his model has stood the test of time. H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer, and recent meta-analyses have shown that eradication decreases the risk of gastric cancer development by approximately 40% in studies of primary prevention and by 54% as a tertiary prevention strategy. However, it is uncertain if similar reductions can be extrapolated to regions where non-cardia gastric cancer is less common. Endoscopic screening and radiologic and endoscopic programs have been implemented in some countries to control the burden of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer.

The study included 299 women with singleton pregnancies, of which 79 had severe hypoproteinemia (SHP) and 220 had mild hypoproteinemia (MHP). The results showed that women with SHP were more likely to present with abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta than women in the MHP group. Additionally, the SHP group had a higher percentage of cesarean section (CS) and a lower rate of spontaneous delivery compared to the MHP group. The study also found that women with SHP were more likely to have poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, including fetal growth restriction, neonatal asphyxia, and preterm birth. The results suggest that hypoproteinemia is a significant risk factor for CS, poor maternal outcomes, and poor neonatal outcomes in PE.

Over the last two decades, there has been an increased understanding of the mechanisms of antigen presentation, lymphocyte recognition, and the means by which tumors can circumvent these responses. As a result, there has been a growing recognition that some of these agents, while likely safe, may best be used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies. To identify biomarkers of immunological efficacy, researchers have used various approaches, including the use of serum samples from patients treated with immune-modulating therapies. These samples were collected prior to treatment and after three months of treatment from three separate clinical trials. The study aimed to evaluate the use of machine-learned Bayesian belief networks (ML-BBNs) as a method for identifying potentially promising biomarkers and potential biomarkers networks. The researchers trained several ML-BBNs to identify promising biomarkers and then used these networks to select a subset of features to train a network of immune biomarkers as they related to observed declines in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The study found that igg immune responses could be detected to individual antigens, and as long as one year after therapy, the recognition of specific antigens was associated with individual treatments. The evaluation of igg responses to groups of antigens at three months suggests that predictive models might be developed with diagnostic potential. These findings support the concept of using measures of antigen spread as biomarkers of immunological efficacy for immune-active therapies, and igg responses to panels of tissue-associated antigens as measures of this antigen spread.

The study explores the use of piezoelectric materials to mechanically stimulate bone growth. The authors developed an actuator device that applies mechanical stimulation to the bone through piezoelectric films. The device was implanted in a merino ewe's hind limb, and the results showed that total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher than in static controls. The increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation, with the area occupied by woven bone and osteoid being 64.89% of the total bone area. The study also found that the mineral apposition rate was significantly higher around actuated devices than around static devices. Immunohistochemistry results showed that there was a marked elevation in osteopontin (opn) detection around the actuators, and opn was also strongly labeled in the fibroblast layers closer to the piezoelectric films. The study suggests that the generated strains under the experimental conditions were low but enough to elicit a response, and that mineral apposition rate and total bone mass are significantly higher around actuated films when compared to static controls.

The text describes an experiment conducted to investigate the role of LCN2 in adipose tissue metabolism. Male wild-type and LCN2-knockout mice were fed a high-fat (HFD) or regular chow diet, and their body weight, fat pad weight, and organ weight were measured. The study found that LCN2-knockout mice gained more body weight and had larger fat pads than wild-type mice, even when fed a regular chow diet. The mice were also subjected to glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and the results showed that LCN2-knockout mice had impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Additionally, the study found that acute exposure to cold temperatures led to increased thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue of wild-type mice, but not in LCN2-knockout mice. The study also showed that LCN2-knockout mice had reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function in brown adipose tissue. Overall, the study suggests that LCN2 plays a critical role in regulating adipose tissue metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

The authors propose that stem cells in the lung may play a key role in the initiation and proliferation of human lung cancers, as they share functional properties with cancer cells and are present in many tumors. The study of lung epithelial response to airway injury has shown evidence for the role of stem cells in airway repair, and the presence of stem cells in tumors may indicate worse prognosis. The authors suggest that characterization of putative stem cells requires manipulation of the cells themselves, and it remains difficult to discriminate between potential or facultative and true stem cells.

The study aimed to evaluate the role of the urethral plate in the success of tip urethroplasty for the management of primary anterior penile hypospadias.
The study included 100 children who underwent tip repair for hypospadias between 2010 and 2013.
The urethral plate was categorized into three groups based on its width: group A (>8 mm), group B (8 mm), and group C (<8 mm).
The study found that group B patients had a significantly higher incidence of fistula compared to group A patients (p=0.004).
Similarly, group B patients had a higher incidence of failed 8 Fr calibration compared to group A patients (p=0.01).
The study also found that patients with a flat urethral plate had a higher incidence of fistula compared to patients with a cleft or deeply grooved urethral plate (p=0.4).
The study concluded that the use of a urethral plate augmentation is recommended when the urethral plate is narrow and inelastic, and that this technique can be used for primary anterior penile hypospadias with satisfactory results.
The study's findings suggest that the tip urethroplasty technique has several advantages, including preservation and utilization of the urethral plate without the need for additional flaps, a single suture line of the neourethra, creation of a glandular and penile urethra, a short operative time, and a low complication rate.
The study's results are in agreement with previous reports that have shown that the width of the urethral plate is an important factor in the success of tip urethroplasty for hypospadias repair.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood characterized by tonic seizures, atonic seizures, and other types of seizures.
The second feature required by the definition of LGS is an interictal awake electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern consisting of slow spike waves.
The third component of the definition of LGS is cognitive impairment involving moderate to severe mental retardation and behavioral disorders.
The typical age of onset of LGS is between 2 and 5 years, and boys are affected more often than girls.
The prognosis of LGS is poor, with regard to both seizure control and cognitive outcome.
Risk factors for poor cognitive prognosis include symptomatic etiology, history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset.
Difficulties in diagnosing LGS are discussed, including the heterogeneous causes and the frequent occurrence of atypical absence seizures.
Systematic difficulties complicate progress in drug trials for LGS, including the risk of hepatotoxicity with felbamate use and the lack of controlled studies.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that if a pregnant woman contracts rubella during the early stages of pregnancy, there is a 90% chance that the virus will reach the fetus and cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). To prevent this, rubella vaccination is crucial for mothers and their fetuses. The most commonly used vaccine globally is the RA 27/3 strain, which induces more immunity and is similar to natural infection. Seroepidemiological studies have been conducted in various countries, including Australia, Denmark, and Iran, showing a significant decrease in anti-rubella antibodies and immunity after vaccination. In Iran, mass vaccination of rubella in 2003 resulted in a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibody from 20.42% to 0.7%. The findings are in line with reliable sources and extensive country studies, and the result also agrees with research conducted in Mashhad.

The use of quantum dots (QDs) for in situ hybridization in whole mounts of Xenopus embryos has been explored as a means to improve the detection sensitivity and resolution of RNA molecules. The penetration of QDs into embryonic tissues was found to be limited due to their large size, but proteinase K treatment can render Xenopus embryos permeable to QDs. The use of QDs for in situ hybridization in Xenopus embryos has the potential to provide higher resolution data than current techniques, and the ability to carry out two-color in situ hybridization simultaneously using QDs is a significant advantage.

The text discusses the survival and prognosis of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The authors used a dataset from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to develop two nomograms to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities for patients with PDAC. The nomograms were developed using demographic, clinical, and treatment variables and were validated using calibration and discrimination tests. The authors found that the nomograms were able to estimate personalized survival probabilities, which can influence clinical decision-making and patient anxiety. The reliability and generalizability of the models were proven by their calibration and discrimination abilities, and the nomograms were proposed for clinical use. The authors used cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities and developed a web-based, real-time prognostic tool for patients with PDAC. The tool provides survival and conditional survival probabilities, as well as their corresponding standard errors, and can be used to estimate personalized survival probabilities.

730,"  The frequency response of a resonator was measured using a downmixing method, which involved applying a driving voltage to a side-gate parallel to the resonator and using a bias voltage to down-mix the resistance change occurring at the actuation frequency. The measurement setup included a lock-in amplifier, which generated the drive and bias signals. The allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration, and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency. The phase of the measured signal was monitored for a certain amount of time and transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator. Close to the resonance frequency, the phase response was linear, and using the complete phase response instead of the linearization did not significantly alter the allan deviation. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth.",1

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs proposes that human needs can be categorized into five levels: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization. Safety needs are the most fundamental and essential, as they provide a sense of security and stability. The organism will prioritize safety needs over other needs when they are threatened or absent. Safety needs include personal security, financial security, and health and well-being. The brain processes safety needs faster than other needs, and a threat to safety needs can activate the fight-or-flight response. The amygdala is the neural basis for fear and plays a crucial role in detecting and evaluating safety threats.

The study investigates the involvement of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in various physiological processes and their potential therapeutic applications. The researchers synthesized and evaluated a series of EET analogs as potential therapeutic agents, focusing on their ability to act as agonists of the epoxide hydrolase (SEH) enzyme. The analogs were designed to modify the free carboxylic acid of the parent EET molecule, while retaining key structural features of the pharmacophore identified earlier. The studies showed that the analogs exhibited varying levels of vasoactivity and SEH inhibition, with some compounds displaying useful EET agonist activities but poor SEH inhibition. The researchers also explored the use of heterocyclic bioisosteres identified from literature sources as a replacement for the carboxylate group in EET analogs. The study found that the sulfone variant 13 regained some vasopotency, probably due to an increase in the acidity of the phenol, and that the isomeric thioxo-1,2,4-oxadiazole 25 registered a 6-fold improvement in ed50 over 14,15-eet.

The study aimed to investigate the periprostatic nerve distribution in the human prostate using a 3-dimensional model. The prostate, along with the seminal vesicle, bladder, and rectum, was removed en bloc from five adult male cadavers. The specimens were sliced into sections, and the nerve fibers were counted in each section. The results showed that the number of nerve fibers was evenly distributed on both the lateral and dorsal parts of the prostate, without forming any cord-like structures. The study found that the ventral part of the prostate had fewer nerve fibers compared to the lateral and dorsal parts. The findings suggest that an excessive high incision on the ventral part of the prostate is insignificant during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.

The mineral polyhalite, which is composed of potassium, calcium, and sulfur, was first described in the salt mine of Bad Ischl, Austria. Polyhalite is a rare mineral in most salt deposits and has been found in only a few locations worldwide. The crystal structure of polyhalite was determined through laboratory experiments, and it was found to be stable within a wide range of temperatures. Polyhalite can form through the reaction of gypsum with appropriate solutions in a ternary system, and its dehydration temperature ranges from 255 to 343 degrees Celsius. The formation of polyhalite in salt deposits is believed to occur through the brine-back reaction of gypsum with earlier formed anhydrite or glauberite. Polyhalite is an important mineral for absolute age dating and has been used to determine the geological history of a region. The alpine polyhalites are believed to have formed around 235 to 2025 million years ago, and their maximum estimated overburden is approximately 800 meters. The Hallstatt salt mine in Austria is within the Upper Permian to Lower Triassic Haselgebirge Formation, and the polyhalite rocks found there have been dated to around 2025 million years ago.

752,"  The recent advances in molecular biology and microscopy technologies have provided new insights into the folding of the genome at the chromosome level. The dynamic folding of chromatin is crucial for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. The genome is folded into chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), which are units of chromosomes with higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions. TADs are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions, and their boundaries are enriched for specific histone modifications and the presence of transcription factors. The ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BRG1, plays a role in establishing nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization at TAD boundaries. The loss of BRG1 leads to reduced nucleosome occupancy at Cohesin-bound regions, which may disrupt the chromatin structure and affect the integrity of TAD boundaries. The interaction between BRG1 and Cohesin is essential for the recruitment of Topoisomerases to chromatin, which in turn regulates TAD boundary regions. The recent findings suggest a strong link between chromatin remodeling enzymes, architectural proteins, and topoisomerases in genome organization. The reduction in TAD boundary strength upon BRG1 knockdown may be due to perturbations in the recruitment of Cohesin and Topoisomerases, which affects the integrity of the chromatin structure and the stiffness of the chromatin at TAD boundaries.",1

The study aimed to discover pathogen-regulated transcriptomic pathways in vivo by using cells exposed to inflammation as a means to identify changes in gene expression. The researchers used a tractable experimental model of Leishmania infection and discovered that expression of an RXRA-centered transcriptional pathway downregulated in infected kupfer cells (KCs) favors parasite survival. Pharmacological manipulation of RXR activity perturbed the transcriptomic network of infected KCs, leading to enhanced leishmanicidal activity. The study also examined KC behavior before and after infection in live mice and found that neither injection of live or heat-killed amastigotes resulted in detectable changes in KC volume or surface area. Flow cytometry analysis of hepatic mononuclear cell preparations identified infected and inflamed KC populations based on the presence of fluorescent amastigotes. The study then used fluorescence-activated high-speed cell sorting to isolate KCs and separate them into infected or uninfected cell populations. Microarray analysis was used to generate gene lists for infected and inflamed KCs, and string analysis showed that there were genes that were normally regulated as part of the inflammatory response that were not regulated in infected cells.

The establishment of vegetation in arid and semi-arid lands is crucial for mitigating erosion and improving public perception. However, the uncertainty in vegetation establishment is high due to reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment. Native perennial warm-season grasses are important for surface stability and erosion prevention, but their establishment is challenging due to dry conditions and competition from other vegetation. A study analyzed 31 years of historical rainfall event data to estimate the frequency of successful establishment of native perennial warm-season grasses in southern Arizona. The study used a land surface model driven by hourly atmospheric forcing data to simulate the expected soil moisture and surface energy and water fluxes. The model was calibrated to match the observed soil moisture and surface energy and water fluxes from a nearby flux tower data. The study found that the no-analog model overestimated wintertime precipitation and had the largest effect on the simulation of soil moisture, while other variables had less effect.

The study aimed to investigate the use of small RNA molecules, called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), to regulate gene expression in stem cells. The researchers designed siRNAs that targeted specific genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming, including Klf4 and c-Myc. They tested the ability of these siRNAs to upregulate the targeted genes and their downstream genes in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results showed that the siRNAs were able to effectively upregulate the targeted genes and their downstream genes, indicating that the use of siRNAs as a tool for studying stem cell biology and for manipulating stem cell gene expression without altering the genome is promising. The study also showed that the siRNAs were able to activate the targeted genes by altering the metabolic state of the cell, rather than by altering the genome. The researchers used a novel bioinformatic approach to design the siRNAs, which targeted the antisense transcripts of the Klf4 and c-Myc genes. They found that the siRNAs were able to bind and degrade the antisense transcripts, leading to the activation of the targeted genes. The study suggests that siRNAs have the potential to be used as a safe and effective method for manipulating stem cell gene expression in a specific and targeted manner.

The association between betel nut chewing and oral cancer has been well established for over a century. Betel nut is a synergistic carcinogen when consumed with tobacco, increasing the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer. The majority of oral cancer cases in India are caused by betel nut chewing, with a strong dose-response relationship between frequency and duration of chewing. Betel nut contains known carcinogens, including arecoline, arecaidine, and guvacine, which affect the nervous system and cause oral submucous fibrosis. The incidence of oral cancer in India is 12.5/100,000, with betel nut being the most common cause. Betel nut chewing is a significant public health problem in India, with 330,000 million tons of betel nut produced annually. The industry is a major source of employment for 10 million people in India. Betel nut products, such as gutkha and panmasala, are more dangerous than betel nut alone due to their longer duration of use in the mouth. The promotion of betel nut products is a major factor in their popularity, with attractive packaging and aggressive marketing. Betel nut chewing has been linked to various other cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangio-carcinoma, and laryngeal cancer. Betel nut addiction has also been associated with heart attacks, arrhythmia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.

The concept of patient blood management is gaining increasing attention, particularly in cardiac surgery. The use of blood and blood products is common in cardiac surgery, but there is evidence to suggest that this may not always be necessary. Monitoring hemodynamic parameters and individual organ function can help clinicians make informed decisions about blood transfusions, and strategies such as autotransfusion and cell salvage can help reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for transfusions.

The study aimed to identify and characterize multipotent stem cells in the olfactory epithelium that can regenerate the central nervous system (CNS) after injury. The researchers used olfactory mucosa from albino Wistar rats and obtained the olfactory epithelium through surgical excision. They dissociated the olfactory epithelium cells and separated them into two populations based on their mitotic activity. The study found that one of the populations, globose basal cells (GBCs), multiplied and regenerated vigorously after epithelial damage. The researchers used antibodies to identify and characterize the GBCs, and found that they expressed a specific surface antigen. They also used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting to separate the GBCs from other epithelial cells. The study showed that the GBCs were highly proliferative and had the ability to differentiate into both neural and non-neural cells. The researchers concluded that the GBCs are a promising candidate for use in clinical practice for regenerating the CNS after injury.

769,"  The central nervous system (CNS) was previously considered to be immune-privileged, but recent findings suggest that it is more actively involved in immune surveillance than previously thought. Microglia, a type of immune cell in the CNS, play a crucial role in this immune surveillance, including the elimination of pathogens and the initiation of an inflammatory response. Microglia are also involved in synaptic pruning, which is important for proper brain tissue remodeling, and they express the high-affinity receptor for C3, which is required for the precise execution of synaptic pruning. The activation pattern of microglia in response to invading pathogens is typical of the classical proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages, and they tend to retract their processes and assume an amoeboid shape when activated.",1

Transposable elements, such as retrotransposons and DNA transposons, were once considered as ""junk DNA"" that parasitize the genome. However, recent studies have shown that these elements play important roles in genome evolution, including the creation of new genes and regulatory elements. Retrotransposons are capable of inserting themselves into new locations within the genome, a process called transposition, and can create new copies of themselves through a process called ""molecular domestication."" This process involves the integration of the retrotransposon into the host genome and the loss of its original mobility. Retrotransposons can also be used as a source of genetic innovation, creating new genes and regulatory elements that may be beneficial to the organism. The gag gene, which is derived from a retrotransposon, has been domesticated in mammals and is involved in the development of the placenta.

Misfolded protein aggregates can cause both loss of function and gain of pathogenic functions. These aggregates are thought to be the hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases. The aggregates are formed through a process called template-driven misfolding, which involves the aggregation of distinct polypeptides. The aggregates are able to amplify and spread through neuronal transport processes, leading to the propagation and transmission of disease via misfolded protein aggregates. The intraperitoneal injection of brain extracts containing amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles into the brain of non-human primates induced lesions characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The injection of brain extracts and lewy bodies enriched fractions from patients developing Parkinson's disease into the brain of mice led to the formation of lesions characteristic of the disease.

The study aimed to evaluate the progression of liver disease in African Americans (AA) with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The study included 346 AA patients with HCV genotype 1 who were followed for an average of 8 years. The majority of patients were male (57%), and the mean age was 54 years. The study found that AA patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to non-AA patients. The response to interferon-based therapies was lower in AA patients, and the SVR rate was 15% based on intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The study also found that the time to HCC development ranged from 1 to 14 years after the first visit, with the most common time frame being 4 to 6 years. The risk of developing HCC was not predicted by the presence of cirrhosis at the first visit.

The results showed that methadone induced a short or delayed calcium deregulation in neurons, which may contribute to neuronal cell death. The study also found that the mechanisms underlying this effect are not mediated by opioid receptors, but rather by mitochondrial calcium transport. Inhibition of mitochondrial calcium efflux using the inhibitor cgp37157 increased the abundance of cells showing a type 4 response, suggesting that mitochondrial calcium transport plays a role in methadone-induced calcium deregulation.",1

Isolation of pure populations of cells from heterogeneous cell suspensions is essential in clinical and basic research. Novel size-based separation processes are being employed in micro- and nanoscale devices, which offer advantages such as low cost, portability, and ease of use. These devices use microfabrication to create cell sieves, exploiting differences in size between cell types to separate them. For example, Mohamed et al. (2004) designed a device that separates rare cells, such as metastatic cancer cells, from peripheral blood using a series of narrow channels with varying widths. Cho et al. (2003) used differential motility in laminar flow to separate motile sperm cells from non-motile sperm cells.

The human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, and its genome has a high synonymous codon usage bias. The study analyzed the codon usage pattern of 17 HMPV genomes and found that all preferred codons ended with an ""A/U"" nucleotide, which is consistent with the high nucleotide composition of ""A/U"" in HMPV genomes. The enc value of HMPV genomes ranged from 45.13 to 48.28, which is similar to other RNA viruses in the same family. The study also found that the gc3 skew of HMPV ranged from 0.371 to 0.592, which suggests that the gc composition is involved in the codon usage bias. Correspondence analysis revealed that the first dimension variable f1 and the second dimension variable f2 can reflect 43.27% and 33.38% of total mutation, respectively. The phylogenetic distance might affect the variation of synonymous codon usage in HMPV, and the complementary profile between HMPV and human cell was observed. The study suggests that host factor plays an important role in codon usage bias in HMPV, and the nucleotide composition bias is the main force to influence the synonymous codon usage patterns.

Osteoporosis is a condition where the bones become weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that affects the central nervous system, and it has been found that patients with MS are at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in patients with MS are not fully understood, but it is believed that immobilization, long-term use of glucocorticoids, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and the presence of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of MS contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Bone remodeling is an ongoing process throughout life, and it helps maintain bone strength by removing damaged bone and replacing it with new bone. Disruption of the osteocytes network, which is composed of osteocytes entombed in mineralized bone matrix, can affect several aspects of bone homeostatic system and increase the risk of fractures.",1

The study included 50 patients with vivax malaria, aged 7-68 years, who lived in an endemic area for malaria.
The main symptoms observed in untreated malaria were fever, chills, sweating, and weakness, as well as pain symptoms.
After initiation of treatment, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of fever, arthralgia, back pain, and retroocular pain.
However, there was a significant increase in the frequency of nausea, diarrhea, pale stools, abdominal pain, bitter taste in the mouth, weakness, and hypochondrial pain.
The study found that chloroquine can cause side effects such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Primaquine can also cause side effects such as hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and choluria.
The study suggests that chloroquine and primaquine are effective in reducing parasitemia and symptoms of malaria.
However, the study also highlights the importance of monitoring for side effects and adverse reactions to the antimalarial drugs.

This study compared the spatial relationships between the in-out and out-in transobturator midurethral tapes and the female urethra using a cadaveric study design. The study found that the in-out approach angulated around the urethra in a more acute fashion than the out-in approach, which seemed to follow a more horizontal, flatter trajectory. The tape is not positioned caudally but lies as a band behind the urethra, suggesting its passive (non-obstructive) role in achieving continence. The study also found that the out-in approach was associated with a higher risk of vaginal angle injuries and postoperative groin pain. The more horizontal positioning of the out-in tape's trajectory may explain these clinical observations. The study highlights the importance of careful dissection during the out-in procedure to avoid button-holing and ensure proper placement of the tape. The use of three-dimensional CT imaging allowed for a better spatial understanding of the anatomical position within the pelvis and the relationship between the tapes and the urethra. The study's findings have clinical implications for surgeons, emphasizing the need to pay attention to the second half of the helical pass, regardless of the approach chosen. The advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography may allow for similar measurements of the different tapes' trajectories in vivo in a dynamic setting, potentially correlating these findings to nuances in clinical outcomes.
