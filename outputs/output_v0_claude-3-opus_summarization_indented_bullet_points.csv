‚Ä¢ Transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems are not well-understood
	‚Ä¢ Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials where particles experience directed transport
‚Ä¢ Chaotic deterministic ratchets have complicated phase-space structure that changes with parameters
	‚Ä¢ Transport properties can change dramatically, such as current reversals
‚Ä¢ Mateos conjectured current reversal is correlated with bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior
	‚Ä¢ Later studies by Barbi and Salerno argued this is not always valid
‚Ä¢ The authors study current properties in the same chaotic ratchet system
	‚Ä¢ They consider the impact of different particle ensembles and show current depends on initial ensemble
‚Ä¢ Bifurcations for individual trajectories seem associated with abrupt changes in current
	‚Ä¢ Changes may lead to current reversal depending on the specific current value
‚Ä¢ The authors compare bifurcation diagrams with current behavior
	‚Ä¢ They find current reversals can occur without bifurcations, and vice versa
‚Ä¢ A generalized heuristic is proposed: bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes (spikes/jumps)
	‚Ä¢ Current reversals are a special case of this when the change goes through zero
‚Ä¢ Open questions remain about when the heuristic rules are violated or valid
	‚Ä¢ Further work is needed to make the reasons more concrete

* Limits on additional planets were computed using the radial velocity data
	* Planets with masses above the limits can be ruled out with 99% confidence
* The best limits were obtained for HD 3651, HD 45350, and 16 Cyg B
	* Planets of a few Neptune masses can be excluded in dynamically stable regions for these systems
* Poor limits were obtained for HD 37605, HD 80606, and HD 89744

* The method is illustrated for the pure Hubbard model in 2D and 3D, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit in 2D, and low-U impurities in 2D

* For the low-U impurity model, the spin-fluctuation correction is suppressed on average by the impurities

* Quantum electrodynamics predicts that quantum fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields give rise to a zero-point energy that causes two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum to attract each other (the Casimir effect)
    * The force between two uncharged parallel plates with arbitrary dielectric functions can be derived using Lifshitz's theory
    * Two plates made of the same material always attract, while plates of different materials in a properly chosen liquid can repel each other
    * Parsegian, Weiss, and Barash derived equations for the interaction energy and torque between two dielectrically anisotropic plates, showing that a torque develops causing the plates to rotate towards an aligned configuration
* The authors calculate the magnitude of the torque induced by quantum fluctuations for a small birefringent disk placed parallel to a birefringent barium titanate plate in vacuum
    * The torque is within the sensitivity of available instrumentation if the plate and disk are kept at sub-micron distances
    * To avoid sticking, the authors propose immersing the barium titanate plate in liquid ethanol with the disk placed on top, causing a repulsive van der Waals force to counterbalance the disk's weight and allow it to rotate freely
* Numerical calculations are performed to determine the torque as a function of the angle between the optical axes of the disk and plate, and the distance between them
    * The torque varies sinusoidally with the angle, with maximum magnitude at 45¬∞ and 135¬∞, and is inversely proportional to the second power of distance in the non-retarded limit
    * The sign of the torque depends on the dielectric properties of the materials; it is opposite for a quartz-barium titanate configuration compared to a calcite-barium titanate configuration
* The authors propose an experimental setup to demonstrate the rotation of the disk driven by quantum fluctuations
    * A laser beam can initially rotate the disk, and then a shutter can block the beam to allow the disk to rotate back to its equilibrium position

* The principle of quantum superposition plays a prominent role in quantum mechanics and its applications
	* Environmental action on quantum systems causes loss of coherence, which has been treated mathematically using various approaches
	* Most master equations satisfy the Markov approximation and can be put into Lindblad form
* The authors develop a novel attempt to derive Markovian and non-Markovian master equations using stochastic methods
	* The main idea is to build random evolution operators containing the decohering effect of the environment
	* Taking the stochastic expectation value with respect to this randomness yields the master equation
* The authors prove that any Lindblad-type master equation with self-adjoint Lindblad operators can be understood as an averaged random unitary evolution
	* This allows for a fast method to solve master equations if the unitary solutions are known
	* Both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes are attainable under the same mathematical formalism
* The flexibility of the mathematical language can generalize intrinsic decoherence models
	* The authors propose a generalization of the Jaynes-Cummings model and compare it with experimental results in optical cavities and ion traps
	* The proposed formalism can account for reported exponential decays of Rabi oscillations in ion traps
* The authors discuss the possibility of intrinsic decoherence phenomena and future prospects

	* The paper considers the tidal interaction between a star and a point source (another star or planet), taking into account the star's evolution
	* The problem involves determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations, calculating energy and angular momentum exchange, and focusing on the role of low-frequency g-modes
	* The change in orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity is determined from energy and angular momentum conservation laws
	* The eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of stellar oscillations are needed to calculate the overlap integral, which measures the intensity of tidal forces
* The paper presents calculations of the change in a planet's orbital period for stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses
	* For a star with one solar mass (similar to the Sun), a planet with one Jupiter mass and an initial orbital period ‚â§3 days will fall onto the star within the main-sequence lifetime
	* For stars with 1.5 and 2 solar masses, planets with one Jupiter mass and initial orbital periods ‚â§2 days will fall onto the star within the main-sequence lifetime

‚Ä¢ The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to study periodic advance of glaciers on Earth
	‚Ä¢ It refers to the nonmonotone dependence of a system's response on noise added to a periodic input signal
	‚Ä¢ Extensive reviews have been done on stochastic resonance and its applications in different fields
	‚Ä¢ From a statistical perspective, it involves estimating a signal transmitted through a channel with a threshold
‚Ä¢ The authors study estimation and hypothesis testing for a model with a subthreshold constant non-negative signal and added noise from a diffusion process
	‚Ä¢ Two observation schemes are proposed: 1) proportion of time the perturbed signal is over the threshold, and 2) energy of the perturbed signal above the threshold
	‚Ä¢ Asymptotic properties of estimators are studied for the two schemes, showing the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in an example
	‚Ä¢ The problem of testing a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative is also solved using a Bayesian approach
‚Ä¢ The authors note that using ergodic diffusions as noise in stochastic resonance problems seems powerful but more complex than i.i.d. noise
	‚Ä¢ The problem of parametric non-constant signals can be treated, but nonparametric non-constant signals require further investigation
	‚Ä¢ Other optimality criteria besides Fisher information can be used, as commonly done in information theory

‚Ä¢ The order parameter in high-temperature superconductors has been proven to have mainly a d-wave pairing symmetry
	‚Ä¢ Thermal transport measurements show a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is rotated parallel to the CuO2 planes
	‚Ä¢ This oscillation can be explained by Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by vortices and Doppler shift in the quasiparticle energy spectrum, assuming a d-wave gap
	‚Ä¢ Deviations from the expected angular pattern have been attributed to vortex pinning effects
	‚Ä¢ The variation of thermal conductivity with the angle between heat current and magnetic field depends on quasiparticle heat transport, their interaction with supercurrents, and the order parameter symmetry
‚Ä¢ Experiments were performed on twinned and untwinned YBa2Cu3O7 single crystals to measure the angular variation of longitudinal thermal conductivity
	‚Ä¢ A heat current was applied along the longest axis of the crystals, and the magnetic field was rotated perpendicular to the c-axis
	‚Ä¢ Misalignment between the field rotation plane and CuO2 planes was minimized to less than 1¬∞
	‚Ä¢ A field-cooled procedure was used to rule out the influence of vortex pinning on the measurements
	‚Ä¢ The untwinned crystal showed a smaller peak in the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity, indicating larger impurity scattering and reduced inelastic scattering compared to the twinned sample
‚Ä¢ The angular patterns of longitudinal thermal conductivity at different temperatures agree with the theoretical model and confirm the predominance of d-wave gap symmetry up to Tc
	‚Ä¢ Fourfold oscillations were observed at low temperatures, while the angle dependence changed at higher temperatures due to thermal activation of quasiparticles
	‚Ä¢ The oscillation amplitudes were smaller in the untwinned sample due to larger impurity scattering

‚Ä¢ Dehn surgery is an operation to modify a 3-manifold by drilling and regluing a solid torus. The cosmetic surgery conjecture states that surgeries on inequivalent slopes are never purely cosmetic (resulting in the same oriented manifold).
	‚Ä¢ The authors prove that for most knots, surgeries on distinct slopes result in different manifolds, using a sufficient condition based on the Jones polynomial and its derivatives. This improves on previous results.
‚Ä¢ The authors use a surgery formula by Lescop involving a knot invariant w_3 that is the same as the third derivative of the Jones polynomial. They also observe that w_3 is a finite type invariant of order 3.

* Concerns have been raised about the medical care provided to immigration detainees in ICE custody
	* Congressional hearings, press coverage, and legislation have focused on this issue
* ICE's National Detention Standards specify the medical care to be provided to detainees
	* The standards ensure access to medical, dental, and mental health care, but some argue they are not being adequately followed
* The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS) is responsible for detainee health care
	* DIHS provides care at some facilities, while at others it is provided by contract workers
* DIHS has a covered benefits package that focuses on emergency care
	* Pre-existing, non-emergency conditions require pre-authorization via Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs)
* Several government reports have found issues with compliance to the medical care standards at some detention facilities
	* Issues include failure to provide timely initial screenings and response to sick call requests
* The growing detainee population has raised concerns about the adequacy of spending on detainee health care
	* While spending has increased, some argue it has not kept pace with the growth in the detainee population
* There are questions about the ability to adequately care for vulnerable populations like asylum seekers in detention
	* Asylum seekers may have unique medical and psychological needs due to their experiences
* The appropriate standard of care for immigration detainees is a matter of debate
	* Some argue detainees should receive care comparable to the general population, while others say this is unrealistic given their transitional status and the fact that care is taxpayer-funded

‚Ä¢ The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was authorized by Congress in 2004 with an initial appropriation of $994 million
	‚Ä¢ The MCA is administered by the newly created Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) headed by a CEO who reports to a Board of Directors
	‚Ä¢ Low and lower-middle income countries are eligible to compete for MCA funding based on their commitment to sound development policies
‚Ä¢ The MCA represents a new approach to U.S. foreign assistance by providing aid to countries that demonstrate good governance, investment in health and education, and sound economic policies
	‚Ä¢ Aid is allocated to countries based on 16 objective performance indicators in the 3 policy areas
	‚Ä¢ MCA programs are intended to be country-driven without being influenced by other U.S. foreign policy objectives
‚Ä¢ Key issues debated by Congress included country income eligibility, the specific performance indicators used, the creation of the MCC as a new aid organization, and the types of programs to be funded
	‚Ä¢ The enacted legislation gave the MCC flexibility in managing the program while providing for Congressional oversight
	‚Ä¢ Questions remain about the MCC's impact on USAID and other U.S. aid programs and objectives
‚Ä¢ The Administration pledged to ramp up MCA funding to $5 billion by FY2006 in addition to maintaining other aid programs
	‚Ä¢ However, overall budget pressures may force tradeoffs between the MCA and other foreign assistance priorities
	‚Ä¢ The MCA marks a departure from traditional aid programs by tying a large pool of funding to country performance and results

‚Ä¢ The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) authorized funding for federal research in the physical sciences and engineering, STEM education, and other programs between FY2010 and FY2013.
	‚Ä¢ The act's central policy contributions were the ""doubling path"" policy for the NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, and authorization of STEM education activities.
‚Ä¢ The President's FY2013 budget requested increased funding for the doubling path accounts but included support for few COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs.
	‚Ä¢ Of the new programs authorized in COMPETES 2010, only the Regional Innovation Program at the Department of Commerce was included in the budget request.
‚Ä¢ Congressional appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies in FY2013 were provided through two acts: a continuing resolution through March 2013 (P.L. 112-175) and a consolidated appropriations act for the rest of FY2013 (P.L. 113-6).
	‚Ä¢ FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding levels for many COMPETES 2010 accounts were below FY2010 actual levels and significantly below authorized levels.

* To address the problem of the remote being easily lost, the team considered adding a proximity alarm or voice recognition
    * With one of those features, they rated it a 2 for solving the lost remote problem
* The team felt the remote was not very technologically innovative, rating it a 4 on that scale
    * Most of the technology was adapted from other devices like the iPod scroll wheel
* Some spongy material was incorporated into the rubber grips, but not enough to rate it a 1

* The team felt the remote put some fashion into electronics, but more so through the interface than the color and shape
    * The recent fashion trends were more evident in the LCD screen and scroll wheel operation
* After totaling and averaging the scores, the prototype received an overall score of 2.42 out of 7

* The project manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting, including trends like a fancy look-and-feel, fruit and vegetable styles, and a spongy feel. They also discussed components like case materials, energy sources, and chips.
	* The user interface and industrial designer presented the prototype remote control shaped like a banana, with a scroll wheel for control, rubber grips, and a simple on/off switch.
	* The prototype aimed to be simple and intuitive to use, with the main controls being for channel and volume.
	* The bright yellow color was dictated by the company but some felt it detracted from the aesthetics of the curved, modern shape.
	* Suggestions were made to possibly make the remote smaller or add features like a locator alarm if it gets lost.
* Marketing led an evaluation of the prototype against user complaint criteria, and the team gave the remote a score of 2.43 out of 7.
	* For the budget, the team determined the remote would use 2 batteries, an advanced chip, a double curved plastic case, and an integrated scroll wheel/pushbutton.
	* To meet the budget, the LCD display was removed, relying instead on on-screen information from the TV. This brought the cost to 12.5 euros.
	* In evaluating the project, the team felt there was good teamwork, room for creativity, and they stayed on track, although leadership started off weak.
	* The project manager wrapped up the meeting, noting the project was evaluated, costs were within budget, and that a final questionnaire and approval from the main boss were still needed.

‚Ä¢ There is no one single reason why free school meal children were less resilient in exams last year
	‚Ä¢ Possible factors include the move from BTECs to science GCSEs and the impact of studying literature
	‚Ä¢ The Cabinet Secretary will have a deep dive discussion on this topic at the next ministerial policy board in May
	‚Ä¢ Officials are working with Qualifications Wales to better understand the issue
‚Ä¢ While the overall gap widened in 2017, there has been a narrowing of the gap over the period that PDG has been employed
	‚Ä¢ In 2009, 1 in 5 free school meal children got Level 2 plus, improving to 1 in 3 by 2016
	‚Ä¢ Some schools saw improved free school meal performance in 2017 compared to 2016
	‚Ä¢ Need to understand what enabled free school meal children to do well in certain schools
‚Ä¢ The Cabinet Secretary emphasized that broad conclusions cannot be drawn and school-level factors are important
	‚Ä¢ Large variations in free school meal performance can be seen even between similar schools in the same local authority
	‚Ä¢ One school in Swansea had free school meal Level 2 performance of 88% while another similar school was in the 20% range
	‚Ä¢ The challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what led to their children doing well or not
‚Ä¢ The government is moving away from using Level 2 plus as the main performance measure
	‚Ä¢ A new, more sophisticated performance measure looking at individual pupil progress will be announced soon
	‚Ä¢ Level 2 plus is seen as too narrow and has driven unintended behaviors in schools

‚Ä¢ Sunil presents results on using Wiener filtering for noise reduction
	‚Ä¢ A single stage Wiener filter gives a 30% improvement over the MFCC baseline
	‚Ä¢ Using a second stage of Wiener filtering with smoothing improves performance to 56.5% over baseline
	‚Ä¢ Using the channel 0 VAD endpoints further improves performance to 67% over baseline, showing the importance of good VAD
‚Ä¢ Stephane presents results on using spectral subtraction for noise reduction 
	‚Ä¢ Subtracting more at low SNRs by overestimating the noise does not improve performance alone
	‚Ä¢ Applying nonlinear smoothing of the spectral subtraction gain helps, giving slightly better results than Wiener filtering on Italian data
	‚Ä¢ The smoothing helps reduce musical noise artifacts
‚Ä¢ They discuss how spectral subtraction can lead to negative spectrum values which are typically thresholded or filled in
	‚Ä¢ Leaving the negatives or not subtracting those bins are alternative approaches to consider
	‚Ä¢ Musical noise may sound bad but it's unclear if it actually hurts recognition performance
‚Ä¢ The France Telecom system uses a variant of Wiener filtering with both time and frequency domain smoothing
	‚Ä¢ Stephane's and Sunil's approaches are conceptually similar with multiple stages of noise reduction and smoothing
	‚Ä¢ They are evaluating multiple techniques like Wiener filtering, spectral subtraction, and subspace methods to determine what works best

‚Ä¢ Several possibilities exist for the energy source of the remote control
	‚Ä¢ A basic battery has drawbacks like the need for recharging, bulk, and environmental disposal issues
	‚Ä¢ A hand-powered dynamo, where the user manually charges the power, is considered outdated
	‚Ä¢ Kinetic energy, where shaking the device provides power, is a recently developed option
	‚Ä¢ Solar power may not be useful inside a building where the remote will be used
‚Ä¢ The group prefers the kinetic energy source as an advanced, attractive, and energy-saving technology
	‚Ä¢ It eliminates the need for an external battery supply or solar panels
	‚Ä¢ Shaking the device instantly generates the energy needed to power the circuit
	‚Ä¢ This could be a selling point as a cutting-edge feature of the remote control
‚Ä¢ A backup power option is discussed in case the kinetic energy source has issues
	‚Ä¢ Suggestions include using a single backup battery or possibly solar power
	‚Ä¢ Solar power would require the remote to be left in light for a few hours each day to charge

‚Ä¢ The Professor discussed the Aurora project and competition between different groups
	‚Ä¢ French Telecom Alcatel and the Professor's group both had voice activity detectors, which was seen as unfair by other groups
	‚Ä¢ There was disagreement over whether the evaluation should be redone without voice activity detectors or if the algorithm could be modified
	‚Ä¢ French Telecom was concerned other groups would copy their code if a new evaluation was done
	‚Ä¢ The Professor's group was willing to share their code and techniques
‚Ä¢ There was debate over the criteria and weighting for the Aurora evaluation
	‚Ä¢ Some groups wanted to lower the improvement threshold from 50% to 25% for mismatched conditions
	‚Ä¢ The Professor thought this was a major decision being made too lightly and that they should try to reach 50% again
	‚Ä¢ Nokia and Qualcomm supported keeping the 50% threshold
	‚Ä¢ The Professor thought some groups were trying to match the criteria to their existing solution rather than improve the technology
‚Ä¢ The Professor's group at OGI was working on improving their system, especially noise separation
	‚Ä¢ They were looking at using the LPC spectrum instead of FFT to be more robust to noise
	‚Ä¢ They considered techniques like spectral subtraction and adding noise to all data to make any additive noise less effective
	‚Ä¢ Most of their effort was on a new recognition approach using temporal patterns (TRAPs)
‚Ä¢ Stephane observed that the C1 cepstral coefficient was not very useful in their system
	‚Ä¢ Removing C1 had little effect on performance
	‚Ä¢ This led to a discussion on how to adjust the importance of different coefficients by modifying the model variances
	‚Ä¢ Increasing variance would decrease importance of a coefficient; decreasing variance would increase importance
‚Ä¢ The Professor shared anecdotes highlighting inefficiencies and lack of oversight in some organizations
	‚Ä¢ One company had an employee hitting carriage returns to inflate billable computer usage time
	‚Ä¢ Soldiers manning a lookout post outsourced their one daily task of reporting a passing plane to a pub owner

<summary>
* The team discussed their experiences and preferences for remote controls:
	* Dislike having to use multiple buttons or remotes to turn on the TV
	* Prefer simple remotes without too many small buttons
	* Like the idea of spatially dividing buttons by function (TV, VCR, etc.)
* They debated whether to combine functions into one remote or have separate remotes:
	* Concerns about ""multimedia overload"" with too many functions on one remote
	* Suggestion to have one remote for basic functions and another for special features
	* Need to determine if the remote is only for a TV or will control other devices too
* Important remote control characteristics were identified:
	* Easy to use with large, clearly labeled buttons
	* Good infrared signal so you don't have to aim it directly at the TV
	* Uses long-lasting batteries like lithium ion instead of AAA
* Next steps were outlined before the next meeting:
	* Project manager will research if the remote is only for a TV or other devices as well
	* Individual team members will complete their assigned tasks and receive further instructions
	* They will reconvene to discuss more concrete ideas based on their work

‚Ä¢ The team reviewed findings from market research on what users want in a remote control
	‚Ä¢ 75% of users find current remotes ugly and 80% would pay more for a fancy-looking remote
	‚Ä¢ Users dislike the look, feel and complex operation of current remotes with too many buttons
	‚Ä¢ 50% of users frequently lose their remotes, so a tracking feature would be beneficial
	‚Ä¢ Younger users are more willing to pay extra for speech recognition capabilities
‚Ä¢ The technical functions and components of a typical remote control were discussed
	‚Ä¢ A universal remote that could control many devices would be too complex and expensive
	‚Ä¢ The remote should be user-centered with a simple interface and minimal buttons
	‚Ä¢ Key components include an energy source, user interface, chip, and infrared lamp
	‚Ä¢ Options for the user interface include buttons, speech recognition, and touch pads
‚Ä¢ New design requirements were presented, including making the remote for TV use only
	‚Ä¢ The remote should incorporate the corporate colors of yellow and grey
	‚Ä¢ The company slogan ""We put the fashion in electronics"" must be included
	‚Ä¢ Speech recognition was deemed too expensive and not worth including
‚Ä¢ The team brainstormed ideas for the physical shape and design of the remote
	‚Ä¢ Current remotes are typically rectangular, so a new shape like rounded square was proposed
	‚Ä¢ The shape should be designed for one-handed use, possibly with a side bulge to fit the hand
	‚Ä¢ Button size and placement should correspond to frequency of use, with commonly used buttons near the thumb
	‚Ä¢ A scroll wheel and click function for navigation through menus was suggested
‚Ä¢ Two concepts were proposed for further development
	‚Ä¢ A two-part design with a main unit and smaller ""zap"" unit for basic functions

‚Ä¢ The Minister believes a level of schools in the red category that she would be content with is not specified, but 11% of secondary schools being judged as unsatisfactory is not acceptable
	‚Ä¢ A new multi-agency approach is being piloted to provide more support to schools causing concern and move them forward more quickly
	‚Ä¢ This involves the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn and Welsh Government working together as a panel
	‚Ä¢ The aim is to identify fundamentals that need addressing, the school's capacity to address them, and what sustainable improvement looks like over 6-18 months
	‚Ä¢ Initial feedback on the pilot is very positive and some local authorities want to include more schools
‚Ä¢ The Minister has been convinced of the value of regional working for school improvement services, in the absence of local government reform to create larger units
	‚Ä¢ There is variation in the effectiveness of the regional consortia, with some performing highly and others needing to improve
	‚Ä¢ The consortia are increasingly working together on a national approach delivered regionally for greater consistency
	‚Ä¢ ERW has particular challenges that are being worked on, and the Minister is disappointed by Neath Port Talbot's notice to withdraw
	‚Ä¢ If Neath Port Talbot does withdraw, they will need to demonstrate how they will support their schools without being part of ERW
‚Ä¢ Professor Dylan Jones's strategic delivery group is working to clarify roles and responsibilities of partners in the middle tier to support curriculum implementation
	‚Ä¢ This is about ensuring there isn't duplication and that partners can rely on each other to fulfill their responsibilities 
	‚Ä¢ The Minister receives feedback from the group but it operates at arm's length from government
	‚Ä¢ The group has an ongoing role and is not a task and finish group
