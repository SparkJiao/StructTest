The KTHNY theory describes a quasi-equilibrium transformation of a solid into a liquid, with two separate continuous transitions: the translational order vanishes during the first stage, while the orientational order decays in the second stage.

Conduction for the other conductor is provided through a peg conductor. The upper glass envelope is supported by a metal sleeve, which can cause problems due to thermal cycling and the use of adhesives.\n\u2022 Problems with conventional subminiature lamps include the use of adhesives which break down from thermal cycling, destructive shear caused by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients, degradation from liquid cleaning procedures, and moisture intrusion which causes corrosion and early failures.\n\u2022 Solution: The invention utilizes a high temperature polymer which directly surrounds and is in compression contact with the glass envelope. The polymer derives support from a metal base and can be manually handled. A fluoroelastomer is a preferable type of elastomer due to its chemically resistive properties and ability to withstand high temperature.\n\u2022 Advantages: The elastomer used for the seal supported lamp assembly provides extended axial length sealing, heat resistance, ease of handling, and increased resistance to invasion and chemical attack.\n\u2022 The polymeric seal support forms a housing around both the glass envelope and the abbreviated height one piece conductive base, making a liquid tight seal. The material can be chosen based on the maximum working temperature of the elastomer.\n\u2022 An added feature is the inclusion of a potting material underneath the glass envelope to fix it stably and better protect the upper portions of the leads. The potting material should be sufficient to withstand any axial compression of the glass envelope against the abbreviated height one piece conductive base as the polymeric seal support is being fitted.\n\u2022 The polymeric seal support makes a static radial seal with the straight sidewall of the subminiature lamp glass envelope, with a much longer seal length than conventional \"o\" ring type seals.\n\u2022 The elimination of adhesive or cement allows for much closer tolerance centering of the", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_subpoints": 3, "symbol": "\u2022"}}
