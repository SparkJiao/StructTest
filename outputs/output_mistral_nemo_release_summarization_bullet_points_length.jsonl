Large-scale simulations have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high-mass galaxies, suggesting that some process must be able to stop or \"quench\" star formation before the galaxy grows too big. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are believed to play a role in this process by regulating the SFR through feedback mechanisms.\n* The authors present a large sample of 313 Seyfert galaxies selected using ultra-hard X-ray observations with the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and imaged with Herschel/Spire. They focus on the overall luminosity distributions at the Spire wavebands and the Spire colors to determine the likely heating sources of cold dust in AGN host galaxies and to look for correlations with a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity.\n* The study finds that Seyfert 2s are detected at a higher rate than Seyfert 1s, and after accounting for upper limits, Seyfert 2s have slightly higher Spire luminosities than Seyfert 1s. However, the effect is small, indicating that the global FIR properties of AGN are independent of orientation. The Spire luminosities are correlated with each other, suggesting that the process (or processes) producing the emission from 70-500 \u03bcm is connected. None of the Spire luminosities are well correlated with the 14195 keV luminosity, a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity.\n* The study also finds anomalous colors for 6 BAT AGN, indicating that the FIR seds for these AGN are dominated by synchrotron emission from a radio jet rather than thermally heated dust. Another group of AGN with less anomalous colors but still removed from the main locus were analyzed by fitting the seds with a modified blackbody and calculating a 500 \u03bcm excess. The 500 \u03bcm excess is not related to radio loudness but is well correlated with the 14195 keV luminosity and the 3.4/4.6 \u03bcm color from WISE.

The success of the cold dark matter cosmological model argues strongly for a major component of the dark matter being in the form of an elementary particle. However, the inventory of baryons observed locally falls short of the total inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations, leaving open the possibility that there may be a significant baryonic component of dark matter.\n\u2022 **Baryonic Dark Matter Models**: Some authors have proposed models that include a large component of baryonic dark matter, such as cold, self-gravitating molecular clouds. Various forms of these clouds have been considered, including isolated, clustered, and fractal, all involving dense gas of high column density in contrast to the diffuse gas in the interstellar medium.\n\u2022 **Gamma-Ray Emission**: One of the fundamental predictions of a model featuring dense gas clouds is the gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray interactions within the clouds. Because of the potentially large total mass of gas involved, this process may yield a diffuse flux in the galactic plane comparable to the flux from known sources for photon energies around 1 GeV.\n\u2022 **Gamma-Ray Production Spectra**: The gamma-ray production spectra arising from cosmic-ray interactions with gas clouds of various column densities have been calculated using a Monte Carlo event simulator, GEANT4. The calculations reproduce the analytic result in the low column density limit but exhibit significant differences for clouds of column density greater than about 10^22 cm^-2, where the emissivity declines substantially for photon energies greater than about 100 MeV.\n\u2022 **Gamma-Ray Constraints**: The low emissivity of dense gas means that the baryonic content of the galaxy's dark halo is not so tightly constrained by the gamma-ray data as had previously been thought. For column densities greater than about 10^23 cm^-2, the existing gamma-ray data, taken in isolation, do not exclude purely baryonic models for the galactic dark halo.\n\u2022 **Future Research**: To further constrain the baryonic content of the dark halo, future research should focus on improving the understanding of the observed gamma-ray emission, particularly at high energies, and on developing more sophisticated models for the distribution of cosmic rays and dense gas clouds in the galaxy.

The authors previously studied spin turbulence (ST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, focusing on the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy.\n* **Spin-Superflow Turbulence (SST) in Spin-1 Ferromagnetic Spinor BECs**: In this paper, the authors treat the problem of spin-superflow turbulence (SST) in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, focusing on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy. They theoretically and numerically find that the spectrum of the kinetic energy shows a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields. When the Kolmogorov spectrum is sustained, the spectrum of the spin-dependent interaction energy exhibits a -1 power law simultaneously.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 16, "symbol": "*"}}

(2000). Hip 115147 was found to have come from the vicinity of the molecular cloud LDN 1709 in the Ophiuchus star-forming region, flanking the Sco-Cen complex.\n* **Activity and Variability**: Hip 115147 is a very young, naked post-T Tauri dwarf, one of the most powerful X-ray emitters in the solar neighborhood, and a variable star (V368 Cep) with a rotation period of 2.74 days. Its high degree of chromospheric and extreme ultraviolet activity suggests a very young age, possibly less than 20 Myr.\n* **Companion Status**: The difference in proper motion between Hip 115147 and LSPM J2322+7847 may indicate they are not gravitationally bound, but more accurate absolute proper motions and spectroscopic radial velocities are needed to clarify their dynamical status. Despite this, the system is likely to stay close together as a moving group at the suggested age of 20-50 Myr.\n* **Future Research", "format_properties": {"n_points": 6, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 24, "symbol": "*"}}

It aims to address the limitations of existing rotary valves by providing a means for sanitizing the valve in place without disassembly.\n\u2022 **Prior Art**: Existing rotary valves, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,808,317, 2,985,589, 3,268,604, 4,409,033, and others, do not provide sanitizable features. Known non-rotary sanitizable valves, like those granted to Mieth, Dolling, Ringo, and Pruett, do not have rotary designs. U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,015 and 4,625,763 describe rotary valves with sealing means but lack sanitizable aspects.\n\u2022 **Invention Summary**: The invention is a novel type of rotary valve that combines elements from the valve art with a unique feature allowing partial separation of the rotor-stator faces for flushing and cleaning. It comprises a rotor with a thermoplastic elastomeric diaphragm molded to form multiple sealing ports and a stator with corresponding ports and gutters. The diaphragm has integral dynamic wipe sealing lips that maintain fluid-tight sealing engagement with the stator face even when the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator for sanitization.\n\u2022 **Invention Operation**: The valve operates by rotating the rotor to index the ports, allowing fluid flow between the rotor and stator ports. For sanitization, the rotor is moved orthogonally away from the stator, breaking the seal between the rotor sealing ports and the stator face. Sanitizing fluid is then flushed across the sealing faces of the stator and the diaphragm, cleaning the port sealing faces. The valve also has a barrier fluid flow path to prevent accumulation of dried material and release of solution to the external environment.\n\u2022 **Invention Applications**: The invention is designed for use in liquid chromatographic columns and sanitary liquid handling systems to separate and/or purify biological macromolecules of importance to the pharmaceutical industry. It can be adapted for use in simulated moving bed (SMB) adsorption and separation processes, such as those used in the Sorbex Cascade system for hydrocarbon fractionation and fructose enrichment, and in ion exchange fractionation separation systems with separate flowpaths for adsorption, desorption, and stripping.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 20, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

These methods aim to synthesize guanidines under mild conditions, with high yields, and minimal reagents, while avoiding toxic catalysts.\n\u2022 **Prior Art**: Traditional guanylation methods use coupling reagents and bases, often requiring excess amounts and longer reaction times. Mercuric salts, though effective, are toxic and difficult to separate from the product. N-alkyl substituted S-methylisothioureas are inadequate for guanylating aliphatic primary and secondary amines due to reversibility and the need to remove methyl mercaptan.\n\u2022 **Invention**: The invention provides methods of forming substituted guanidines by reacting guanylating agents (thioureas or isothioureas) with amines or pyrrolidines in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Preferred guanylating agents include bis-protected thioureas and isothioureas, with Boc and Cbz as preferred protecting groups.\n\u2022 **Reaction Conditions**: The reactions are preferably carried out at temperatures ranging from -30 to 140\u00b0C, more preferably at room temperature or under ambient conditions, in a solvent system comprising DMF, THF, DMSO, or water mixed with any of the foregoing. The nickel catalyst should be present at less than about 10 molar % nickel, preferably less than about 5 molar % nickel, based on the total moles of guanylating agent(s).\n\u2022 **Examples**: The invention demonstrates the synthesis of various N-substituted and N,N-disubstituted guanidines from bis-protected thioureas and isothioureas in the presence of nickel catalysts.

Furthermore, as such variations in resistance have a nonlinear characteristic with respect to the input magnetic field, an MR head also needs a bias current for keeping the operating point in a more linear region. Recently developed MR heads are designed to use these currents in combination.\n\u2022 Where MR heads are to be used in a rotary head type magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus, a bias current circuit and a preamplifier circuit are mounted on the rotary drum. Therefore, power to drive these circuits needs to be supplied to the rotary drum side, and it is usually transmitted via a rotary transformer or a slip ring (contact).\n\u2022 A technique to mount MR heads on a rotary drum and control bias currents to determine the operating points of the MR heads is described, e.g. in J-P-A No. 177924/1998. Further, J-P-A No. 105909/1998 discloses a bias current regulating apparatus capable of flowing optimal bias currents to individual MR heads. J-P-A No. 201005/1995 reveals a method by which optimal bias currents are applied to active MR heads at the time of executing each head switching command.\n\u2022 For high density recording/reproducing apparatuses using a magnetic tape, the prevailing trend is to increase the number of magnetic heads (MR heads) mounted on the rotary drum in order to expand the capacity and enhance the transfer rate. Since each MR head differs in sensitivity and optimal operating point according to its element length from the sliding surface of the tape (MR height), it is preferable to individually optimize the bias current where plural MR heads are to be used. However, if it is necessary to provide the rotary transformer for controlling the MR bias currents with as many channels as the MR heads, it will become difficult to increase the number of MR heads to be mounted on the rotary drum. Furthermore, where control information is to be transmitted in analog signals, there will be another problem of difficulty to achieve high enough precision.\n\u2022 An object of", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 21, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

They can also initiate removal proceedings by preparing a notice to appear in immigration court.\n* **Program Models**: ICE has developed three models for state and local law enforcement participation: the jail model, task force model, and joint model. The jail model allows correctional officers to screen arrested individuals for immigration status, while the task force model allows officers in criminal task forces to do the same.

{"idx": 506, "result": 0, "generated": "\u2022 **Agency Budgets and Strategic Goals**: Agency budgets may not be fully linked to strategic goals, and they may not adequately consider likely agencywide resource limitations. Agencies often pursue their individual needs rather than collective needs, and individual program and funding decisions may undercut sound policies. Congressional direction sometimes requires agencies to buy items and provide services that have not been planned for and may not be needed.\n\u2022 **Agency Spending Actions**: Agency spending actions that would not otherwise be taken based on an objective value and risk assessment with consideration of available resources work against good strategic planning. Such spending can circumvent careful planning and divert resources from more critical needs, exacerbating the serious long-range fiscal imbalance.\n\u2022 **Agency Acquisition Challenges**: Agencies often budget and allocate resources incrementally, largely based on historical precedents, rather than conducting bottom-up reviews and allocating resources based on the broader goals and objectives of agency strategic plans.

Inadequate oversight has resulted in little or no accountability for recurring and systemic problems.\n\u2022 **Contract Management Challenges**: Contracts, especially service contracts, often do not have definitive or realistic requirements at the outset to control costs and facilitate accountability.

However, the scope of CIM has broadened to include all DOD functional areas, with the primary objective being to improve business processes through techniques such as business process reengineering and continuous process improvements. Standardization and improvement of DOD\u2019s supporting information systems remain a major CIM objective.\n* **CIM Progress and Challenges**: JLSC, established to oversee CIM implementation in materiel management and depot maintenance, has made progress in selecting migration systems and documenting current logistics processes. However, it faces several challenges, including lack of full acceptance of CIM by some DOD functional and technical managers, lack of integration with other CIM efforts, and unclear program management authority.\n* **Expert Advice and Reviews**: Industry experts and independent studies have advised DOD to focus on reengineering business processes before improving automated information systems. However, DOD has placed more emphasis on selecting and implementing migration systems, which could delay significant improvement of logistics processes and result in the deployment of information systems that do not meet service and DLA needs.\n* **Recommendations**: To address these challenges and ensure the success of the CIM initiative, the Secretary of Defense should revise the CIM management strategy to ensure active participation of functional managers, train DOD employees to promote understanding and acceptance of changes, and consider renaming the initiative to lessen confusion and more accurately communicate its primary objective.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 5, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 15, "symbol": "*"}}

It was uninhabited until colonized by Portugal in the 15th century and later became a slave trading center. Its location made it a key ship resupply and sailor recruiting center for U.S. vessels, fostering a long-standing tradition of emigration to the United States.\n\u2022 **Demographics and Language**: Most Cabo Verdeans are of mixed Portuguese and African descent and speak a Portuguese-African Creole. The country has a large expatriate population, with a significant presence in New England. Expatriates may vote in national elections, with their collective vote potentially constituting up to a fifth of all votes cast within the national territory.\n\u2022 **Political System**: Cabo Verde became a democracy in 1991, transitioning from a one-party state ruled by the African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (PAICV). It now has a multi-party system dominated by the PAICV and the Movement for Democracy (MPD). The president wields appointment and legislative veto powers, commands the armed forces, and represents the republic domestically and abroad as chief of state.\n\u2022 **Economy and Trade**: Cabo Verde is classified as a lower-middle-income economy with a high literacy rate and generally high social services and health indicators. It imports about 80% of its grain supply and has been recovering from a drought-stricken harvest in 2014-2015. Tourism has grown rapidly, with a record 569,000 arrivals in 2015. Cabo Verde is eligible for tariff preferences under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), but its use of these benefits is minimal.\n\u2022 **U.S.-Cabo Verdean Relations**: U.S.-Cabo Verdean relations are friendly, with a large Cabo Verdean-American and diaspora community in the United States. The countries cooperate on counternarcotics efforts and development projects, with Cabo Verde receiving Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) administered development assistance. They also have a bilateral Open Skies aviation services agreement.\n\u2022 **Counternarcotics Efforts**: Cabo Verde's strategic location has made it a transshipment point for Latin American cocaine bound for Europe. The United States supports Cabo Verde's counternarcotics efforts through the International Military Education and Training (IMET)", "format_properties": {"n_points": 9, "n_sentences_per_point": 3, "n_sentences_total": 27, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

It is jointly administered by the federal government and states, with funding capped at $450 million per year for training and reemployment services.\n* **Eligibility and Benefits**: To be eligible, workers must have been separated from a firm due to increased imports, offshoring, or adverse effects on secondary workers. Benefits include training, case management, job search and relocation allowances, Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) income support, Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) wage insurance, and a Health Coverage Tax Credit for health insurance premiums.\n* **Training**: Training assistance is the largest reemployment benefit, with no federal limit on individual funding. In FY2015, 88% of training participants received occupational skills training, with an average duration of 512 days and cost of $13,062. Most completers (89%) earned an industry-recognized credential or a secondary school diploma or equivalent.\n* **Case Management and Employment Services**: States must use at least 5% of their reemployment services allotments for case management and employment services. These services include a comprehensive assessment of a worker's skills and needs, assistance in developing an individual employment objective, and guidance on training and other services.\n* **Income Support**: Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is a weekly income support payment to certified workers who have exhausted their Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits and are enrolled in training. It has three stages: Basic TRA (up to 52 weeks), Additional TRA (up to 65 weeks), and Completion TRA (up to 13 weeks for those pursuing a degree or credential).\n* **Wage Insurance and Health Insurance Tax Credit**: Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) is a wage supplement for workers age 50 and over who obtain reemployment at a lower wage. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) covers 72.5% of qualified health insurance premiums for workers receiving TRA, UC in lieu of TRA, or RTAA benefits.

Vaccination of susceptible individuals, especially women of reproductive age, can prevent maternal infection and CRS, which affects around 110,000 infants annually in developing countries.\n\u2022 **Rubella Vaccination and Immunity**: The primary goal of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital infection and CRS. The most commonly used vaccine, derived from the RA27/3 strain, induces seroconversion in 95% of vaccinated persons. Extensive vaccination has significantly decreased rubella spread among children.\n\u2022 **Global and Iranian Rubella Immunity**: In Australia, Denmark, and Iran, rubella vaccination programs have led to a significant increase in immunity. In Iran, a national immunity program started in 2003, vaccinating 33.6 million people aged 5 to 25, resulting in a decrease in measles and rubella cases to less than one per million.\n\u2022 **Kermanshah Study on Rubella Immunity**: A study in Kermanshah, Iran, compared rubella immunity in girls before and after mass vaccination.

They were recruited by outreach workers and underwent a structured survey, pretest counseling, and specimen collection for various STIs.\n* **Trichomonas Vaginalis Prevalence**: The overall prevalence of T. vaginalis infection among the 308 women assessed was 16.2%. Older women, those with less education, single women, and those reporting unprotected sex with a non-steady partner or multiple sex partners were more likely to have the infection.\n* **Symptoms and Co-infections**: No association was found between vaginal symptoms and T. vaginalis infection.

Urinary tract obstruction, characterized by tubular atrophy or dilation, cell death, and increased matrix deposition, can occur due to various causes like benign prostatic hyperplasia, renal calculi, or neoplasms. The hydrostatic pressure from blockage initiates renal injuries, characterized by tubular changes, inflammatory infiltration, and progressive fibrosis. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rats is an experimental model that mimics obstructive nephropathy.\n\n\u2022 **Taurine and Paclitaxel**: Taurine, an organic acid and major component of bile, has beneficial effects on renal fibrosis in various conditions like cisplatin-induced injuries, diabetic nephropathy, and age-related renal changes. It plays roles in ion reabsorption, renal blood flow, antioxidant properties, and cell cycle regulation. Paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, has been shown to ameliorate fibrosis in UUO rat kidney models and other kidney diseases. Both taurine and paclitaxel were studied for their potential to attenuate tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserve normal renal histology in a rat model of UUO.\n\n\u2022 **Study Design and Methods**: The study randomly divided rats into four groups: sham-operated, UUO, UUO + taxol, and UUO + taurine. After 28 days, the rats' kidneys were removed, and stereological surveys were conducted to investigate structural changes. Parameters measured included the volume of cortex, medulla, glomeruli, tubules, vessels, and fibrous tissue. Statistical comparisons were made using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests.\n\n\u2022 **Findings and Conclusion**: The study found that both taxol and taurine protected renal tissue from damage after UUO induction in rats. Taxol was more protective than taurine. The protective effects of taxol and taurine may be due to their ability to modulate transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling, prevent cell death and inflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. The study concluded that both taxol and taurine are effective in preventing some structural renal damage in the direct obstruction model in rats, with less necrotic and fibrotic tissue in the treated groups.", "format_properties": {"n_points": 4, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 16, "symbol": "\u2022"}}

Kirsty Williams AM responded that the Welsh Government is fully committed to implementing the Diamond review proposals and is discussing how to implement the recommendations of Reid within the normal budgetary process.\n* **Multi-Year Funding Settlements**: John Griffiths AM also asked about introducing multi-year funding settlements for HE and FE beyond Brexit. Eluned Morgan AM responded that it would be a major loss for the institutions concerned, but it's difficult for the Welsh Government to offer that without having a multi-annual funding commitment from the UK Government.\n* **Apprenticeship Programme Assurances**: Llyr Gruffydd AM asked for assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole, come what may. Eluned Morgan AM responded that the apprenticeship programme is on target to reach 100,000 apprentices, but a'no deal'Brexit scenario would have an impact on the economy and on some companies that are reliant on the EU.\n</summary>", "format_properties": {"n_points": 7, "n_sentences_per_point": 4, "n_sentences_total": 28, "symbol": "*"}}
