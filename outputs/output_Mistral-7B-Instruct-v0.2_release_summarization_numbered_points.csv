1. The transport properties of chaotic deterministic ratchets are not well-understood, particularly in relation to ratchet systems with asymmetric periodic potentials and directed particle transport.
2. Recent interest in these systems stems from considerations of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as observed in biological systems.
3. Chaotic systems, whether deterministic or not, have complex phase-space structures consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or co-existing attractors, which can change significantly with parameter variations.
4. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the ensemble average velocity could be positive or negative depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing.
5. He conjectured a connection between current reversals and bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics.
6. Barbi and Salerno argued against this conjecture, showing that current reversals could occur in the absence of bifurcations and proposed an alternative explanation related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.
7. The current in chaotic deterministic ratchets depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and the number of trajectories considered.
8. The current is less likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or the spread of initial conditions in the chaotic regime, but a larger ensemble is required to ensure convergence.

1. The text discusses the results of observations and simulations of six extrasolar planetary systems, all of which have planets with high eccentricities.
2. The authors used the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) to obtain high-precision radial velocity measurements and perform test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low-mass planets in each system.
3. The simulations showed that there are regions where additional objects can exist, and protected resonances are present in some systems. Combining the simulations with detection limits computed using new high-precision HET data and all available published data can rule out additional short-period planets down to a few Neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions.
4. The authors found that the three systems with the best limits (HD 3651, HD 45350, and HD 16 Cyg b) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions. They also showed that additional factors such as a paucity of data, short time baselines, and large intrinsic scatter made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in the study.
5. The authors concluded that for the six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems studied, there is no evidence for additional planets. However, they emphasized the importance of continuing to search for and characterize exoplanets to better understand their formation and evolution.

1. The LEP experiments have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the @xmath1-decay into fermion pairs with an accuracy of one part in ten thousand.
2. The agreement of LEP data with SM predictions has severely constrained the behavior of new physics at the @xmath1-pole.
3. The physics of @xmath1-boson is expected to play a central role in particle physics if the next generation @xmath1 factory comes true, with generated @xmath1 events several orders of magnitude higher than that of the LEP.
4. The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a proposed electron-positron collider with tunable energy ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and polarized beams in its first phase. The gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of @xmath1 boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
5. With the high luminosity and cross section at the resonance of @xmath1 boson, about @xmath16 @xmath1 events can be generated in an operational year of gigaz, implying an expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of @xmath1-decay improvement from @xmath18 at the LEP to @xmath19 at the gigaz.
6. Among the rare @xmath1-decays, the flavor changing (fc) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics, with branching ratios in new physics models greatly enhanced for lepton flavor violation decays and quark flavor violation decays.
7. Besides the fc processes, the @xmath1-decay into light higgs boson(s) is another type of rare process widely studied, with rates as large as @xmath18 in new physics models within the expected sensitivity of the gigaz.
8. Recent studies have motivated the extension of previous studies to some new models and the investigation of these decays altogether, specifically the singlet extension of the MSSM (nmSSM) and the nearly minimal supersymmetric standard model (nmSSM), where a light cp-odd higgs boson with singlet-dominant component may naturally arise.

1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem, predicts gauge coupling unification, and predicts the existence of superpartners of Standard Model particles.
2. The mechanism of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) sector is an important problem in SUSY phenomenology, and is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak scale.
3. The no-scale type Khler potential is a solution to the SUSY breaking problem, and is characterized by the fact that all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings (a-terms) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes, leaving only gaugino masses as the source of SUSY breaking.
4. The no-scale structure of the Khler potential is obtained in various models, including weakly coupled heterotic string theory and the sequestered sector scenario.
5. The minimal scenario of the no-scale boundary condition is severely constrained by direct search bounds and the cosmological bound, but the other two scenarios, where universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale or non-universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale, are not as severely constrained.
6. The authors of the paper use the no-scale boundary condition to investigate the indication of the current higgs mass and muon g-2 constraint on SUSY models, and find that the minimal scenario is almost completely excluded, while the other two scenarios allow for a wider range of parameter space.

1. Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but these singularities can be weakened by endowing the waves with a relative cross polarization or by coupling them with an electromagnetic (EM) field.
2. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) gave a solution that possesses a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, initiating a literature on the stability of horizons formed in CPW.
3. Yurtsever showed that the CH formed in spacetimes of CPW is unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations, and CX revealed an analogous result through linear perturbation analysis.
4. The electromagnetic field itself plays a role in weakening the strength of a singularity in CPW, and the collision of pure EM waves has a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned.
5. Bell and Szekeres gave a solution describing the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, and the singularity (a CH) formed in the interaction region of their solution was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation, but it possesses essential curvature singularities on the null boundaries.
6. Cross polarization and the EM field both play roles in the nature of the resulting singularity, so a cross polarized version of the Bell-Szekeres (CPBS) solution was pursued.
7. The CPBS solution was found to have the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region, but cross polarization does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries.
8. The paper chooses the CPBS solution as a test ground to justify the validity of a CH stability conjecture proposed previously by Helliwell and Konkowski. The conjecture suggests that adding a test field into the background geometry and studying its reaction can reveal the stability of a CH.

1. Deep X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N), have detected normal galaxies contributing significantly to the diffuse X-ray background (XRB) at cosmologically interesting distances. These normal galaxies make up to 51% of the XRB flux in the 0.52 keV band.
2. The study focuses on galaxies in the redshift range of 0.5 to 1.5, using both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, to investigate the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity in normal spiral galaxies. The data provide extremely deep X-ray coverage, with point-source detection limits in the 0.52 keV and 28 keV bands being 1.3 x 10^-15 erg/s/cm^2 and 1.2 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2, respectively.
3. The analysis reveals that the average X-ray luminosity of spiral galaxies has not evolved upward by more than a factor of 2.5 by z = 1, regardless of exclusion or inclusion of X-ray detected objects. The range of average 0.52 keV fluxes for the spiral galaxies studied is consistent with independent predictions.
4. The study also identifies approximately 50% of the soft XRB as arising from spiral galaxies not yet individually detected in deep surveys. Many of these objects should be bright enough to be detected with ACIS exposures of 10 ms, which should be achievable in the next several years of the mission.

1. Quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical descriptions, with degrees of non-classicality ranging from non-separable (entangled) states to Bell-nonlocal states.
2. Non-separable states cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of their constituents, and their measurement correlations cannot be explained by a local hidden state (LHS) model.
3. Bell-nonlocal states violate Bell inequalities, demonstrating the violation of local causality and allowing two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if either of them or their detectors cannot be trusted.
4. EPR-steerability is a weaker form of non-classical correlation than Bell-nonlocality, allowing a demonstration of EPR-steering if one party's measurements cannot be explained by a hybrid LHS model.
5. The quantum steering ellipsoid formalism is used to investigate the EPR-steerability of two-qubit states with maximally mixed reduced states, specifically the class of t-states.
6. A deterministic LHS model is developed for projective measurements on t-states using the steering ellipsoid formalism, and two sufficient conditions for t-states to be EPR-steerable are derived via EPR-steering inequalities.
7. The paper is organized into sections discussing the notions of non-locality, the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism, and the derivation of asymmetric steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states.
8. The results of the paper contribute to the understanding of the relationship between Bell-nonlocality, EPR-steerability, and non-separability in quantum systems.

1. A visionary idea for using the spin polarization of a single electron to encode binary information for spintronic logic gates was first proposed, but the identity of the originator remains uncertain.
2. Feynman is rumored to have suggested this concept casually around 1985, but concrete schemes for implementing spintronic logic gates did not exist until the mid-1990s.
3. Encoding information in spin offers potential advantages, such as lower power dissipation, immunity to noise, and faster operation.
4. In 1994, a concrete scheme was proposed for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins in a weak magnetic field.
5. Exchange interaction between neighboring spins favors anti-ferromagnetic ordering, or the singlet state, over ferromagnetic ordering, or the triplet state.
6. The ground state of the array has a spin configuration that encodes logic 1 in the upspin state and logic 0 in the downspin state.
7. The system can get stuck in a long-lived metastable state (Fig. 1(b)) due to the weak magnetic field, which can prevent decay to the global ground state (Fig. 1(a)).
8. In 1996, a more elegant solution was proposed to propagate the input state through a linear array by lowering two adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time.
9. This required a three-phase clock, and the use of spins in reversible logic gates was suggested as a way to overcome the Landauer minimum energy dissipation per bit flip.

1. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are short-period binary systems consisting of a white dwarf primary and a low-mass main sequence secondary. The secondary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the white dwarf through the inner Lagrangian point.
2. The main features of the orbital period distribution of CVs with hydrogen-rich donors include the lack of systems in the 2-3 hr period range (the period gap) and a sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.
3. Theoretical models have been unable to reproduce the precise position of the observed short-period cut-off and the shape of the CV orbital period distribution near this cut-off.
4. Systems that evolve under the influence of gravitational radiation (GR) as the only sink of orbital angular momentum (AM) reach a minimum period at around 65 minutes. The probability of finding a system within a given period range is proportional to the time taken to evolve through this region.
5. The orbital period evolution reflects the radius evolution of the mass donor, which in turn is governed by two competing effects: mass transfer and thermal relaxation. The minimum period occurs where the mass transfer time and the thermal (Kelvin-Helmholtz) time are about equal.
6. The position of the minimum period is affected by the assumed mass transfer rate and the assumed rate of orbital angular momentum losses. The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum by increasing the mass transfer rate and to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of period minimum values in the CV population.

1. The Stephan's Quintet (SQ) system is a strongly interacting compact group that has produced a large-scale intergalactic shock wave, first observed as a narrow filament in the radio continuum and subsequently detected in the x-ray. The shock wave is believed to be caused by the high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy, NGC 7318b, with the intergalactic medium of the group.
2. Optical emission line ratios and observed broad linewidths provide evidence that the region is powered by strong shocks and not star formation. The main elements of SQ include the primary shock, NGC 7318b (the intruder galaxy), a large Seyfert 2 galaxy, and other group members. The peculiar extranuclear star formation region, SQ-a, lies at the extreme northern end of the main shock wave.
3. A recent model of SQ involves the collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows, which describes h@xmath9 formation out of the multiphase, shocked gas, and an efficient cooling channel for high-speed shocks as an alternative to x-ray emission. Since the SQ detection, several other systems exhibiting similarly strong h@xmath9 emission have been discovered.
4. The study of nearby prototypes may provide valuable insight into the nature of more distant systems, and the large-scale (~30 kpc) of the SQ shock is well-suited for such a study. In this paper, the authors extend single-pointing observations of SQ to full spectral maps using the IRS instrument on the Spitzer space telescope.

1. The short-lived radioisotope @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula, and some of it may have originated from either the presolar cloud or the solar nebula through a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
2. The injection of @xmath4al was likely a spatially heterogeneous event, reducing its usefulness as a spatially homogeneous chronometer for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation.
3. Previous models have shown that marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disks can substantially reduce initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity through large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles.
4. Other elements and their isotopes suggest a well-mixed solar nebula, but the stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous during the early phases of planet formation.
5. The leading explanation for generating oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, where self-shielding can lead to isotopic fractionation between gas-phase and solid-phase oxygen atoms.
6. MGU disks offer a means to accomplish early large-scale transport of refractory particles from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula.
7. MGU disks are involved in the fu orionis outbursts experienced by young solar-type stars and can lead to the high mass accretion rates needed to explain these events.
8. The fact that molecular hydrogen, which constitutes the majority of a disk's mass, cannot be directly detected means that estimates of disk masses are uncertain, typically based on an assumed ratio between the amount of mm-sized dust grains and the total disk mass.
9. The presented study examines the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula by either a single-shot event or a continuous injection process, for a variety of disk and central protostar masses, including protostars with m dwarf masses.

1. The first observational evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was obtained by finding that supernovae type Ia were fainter than expected. This fact has been confirmed by various observations, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, baryon acoustic oscillations, weak lensing, and gamma-ray bursts.
2. Within the framework of general relativity, the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure, termed dark energy. The nature of this unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort to understand its properties. The observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant being the possible origin of the dark energy, along with a dark matter component giving rise to galaxies and their large scale structures.
3. The current cosmological model, known as the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model, is not satisfactory from the theoretical point of view due to the fine-tuning problem, or coincidence problem, which asks why the time variation of matter and dark energy are so similar at the present time. Interacting dark sectors have been suggested to address this problem.
4. Cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy do not evolve separately but interact with each other have been introduced to justify the currently small value of the cosmological constant and to alleviate the coincidence problem. Observational evidence in favor of an interaction includes the existence of a dynamical dark energy component or an interacting one, as indicated by the data, which can explain the value of the Hubble parameter and the discrepancy of the angular diameter distance at high redshifts.

2. Broad emission lines, like H@xmath0, are thought to originate in or near an accretion disk and show a range of line widths, shifts, and asymmetries.
3. Two populations of Type 1 AGNs have emerged: Population A with smaller broad-line widths (FWHM H@xmath0 = 1000-4000) and Population B with larger broad-line widths (FWHM H@xmath0 = 4000-12000).
4. Population A sources are predominantly radio-quiet, while Population B involves a mix of radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars.
5. Narrow emission lines, like [OIII]5007, are considered reliable measures of the local quasar rest frame, except for ""blue outliers"" found in sources with FWHM H@xmath0 = 1500-3500 and weak [OIII] emission.
6. Blue outliers show [OIII] blueshifts as large as 100000 km/s, and careful use of [OIII] and H@xmath0 narrow lines as rest frame measures suggests that broad H@xmath0 in Population B represents the underlying stable structure.
7. Broad FeII emission has been observed in Type 1 quasars since the 60s, and FeII emission blends are almost ubiquitous in bright SDSS quasars. Circumstantial evidence suggests that FeII emission arises in or near the emitting clouds producing other low ionization lines, and the FWHM of FeII appears to correlate with FWHM H@xmath0 over the detectable range.

3. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN group's data have shown corrections to the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons and growing energies of spectator parts, leading to discrepancies in caloric curves among different experiments.

1. The solar corona is heated to 12 million kelvins while the visible surface is much cooler. Magnetic fields or waves are responsible for converting convective energy in the photosphere to thermal energy in the corona. The primary energy source for this heating lies in the convection zone below the solar photosphere, where 100 times more energy is available than required to heat the corona.
2. Two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures are generated by the interaction of magnetic fields with convective flows. MHD waves can propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona, while field-aligned electric currents can be dissipated resistively in coronal loops.
3. Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of coronal structures have been made using the FE XIV green line and the FE X red line. The results are contradictory, with both positive and negative observations of oscillations. Ground-based equipment is currently the only way to make such observations due to the lack of space missions with comparable time resolution. In this paper, the authors describe a setup to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations using the mid-sized coronagraph at Lomnicky Peak Observatory and the SECIS instrument.

Threshold graphs have important structural properties, such as degree distribution, triangles, betweenness centrality, and the spectrum and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian, which are crucial determinants of dynamics and synchronization and have applications to graph partitioning and mesh processing.
5. Sequence nets are a broader class of nets that can be constructed from a sequence of letters by deterministic rules of connectivity. They retain many of the desirable properties of threshold nets, such as modularity and easily computable structural measures, and gain us much latitude in the types of nets that can be described in this elegant fashion.
6. There are two types of symmetries, permutation and time reversal, that can be applied to sequence nets to generate equivalent graphs. All of the rules for creating connected sequence nets from a two-letter alphabet can be systematically explored, and there are three equivalence classes, each with a high degree of modularity and easily computable structural properties.

The analysis of sequence nets can be extended to three-letter sequences, and there are fifteen distinct three-letter rules, each with its complement, for a total of 30 different classes of three-letter sequence nets.

Both the gamma and poisson subordinators are limiting cases of these two families of compound poisson subordinators.

3. Early experimental work did not verify these predictions, with suggestions that impurity scattering or nonlocal effects may be responsible. However, a more recent reanalysis of experiments claims to confirm the predictions.
4. An alternative proposal was given by Dahm and Scalapino, who examined the quadratic term in the magnetic response of the penetration depth, which shows a upturn dependence at low temperatures. This upturn provides a clear and unique signature of the nodes in the d-wave gap and can be measured directly via microwave intermodulation effects.

The authors find new effects due to strong-coupling at both high and low temperatures for one-band superconductors and examine the situation for two-band superconductors, starting from a case of highly decoupled bands.

The text also discusses the potential impact of these interactions on the baryon asymmetry in the universe and provides equations and references for calculating the conditions for the washout not to occur. Additionally, the text discusses the decay of right-handed neutrinos.",1,{'n_points': 7}

1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems, particularly qubits, plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
2. The study of entanglement's essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has attracted significant attention.
3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) is a phenomenon where qubit entanglement terminates due to Markovian decoherence, but it is not always the final fate.
4. Revived entanglement after ESD has been observed in optical systems and plays a constructive role in quantum information protocols.
5. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, and ESD is always accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) of the reservoirs.
6. The entanglement distribution among subsystems depends on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.
7. The double Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model shows that entanglement is transferred periodically among all bipartite partitions, and an identity about the entanglement in the whole system is satisfied at any time.
8. The identity is still valid in the presence of decoherence, revealing the profound physics of entanglement dynamics under decoherence.
9. The model of two independent qubits in two local reservoirs is given, and the dynamical entanglement invariance is obtained based on the exact solution of the non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of the qubit system.
10. The entanglement distribution over the subsystems when the reservoirs are photonic band gap (PBG) media is studied explicitly, and a stable entanglement distribution is found in the non-Markovian dynamics.

1. The text discusses a model for studying the growth of two interconnected networks, where nodes represent publications in two research areas and links represent references between them. The model is based on preferential attachment, where new nodes attach to existing nodes with a probability proportional to the number of connections they have.
2. The text analyzes the time evolution of the joint distribution of intra-links and cross-links using a rate equation approach. The analysis reveals that the total in-degree distribution of each network follows a power-law form with an exponent that depends on the average total in-degree and the initial attractiveness of nodes.
3. The text also investigates the distribution of the average number of nodes with a given number of intra-links in one network. For large intra-links, this distribution reduces to a simpler form and has a power-law form that depends on the attachment rate and the average degree of the network.
4. The text compares the findings of the model with existing data and empirical studies in citation networks and human sexual contact networks. The model seems to have the flexibility to represent various complex systems and provides insights into the growth and structure of interconnected networks.

3. The text uses the BKK parameterization to determine the shower parton distributions for valence and sea quarks in a shower initiated by a quark or antiquark, and any light quark distribution in a gluon-initiated shower.

2. Dirac-Khler formulation of fermionic field theory uses the antisymmetry of differential forms to describe Clifford algebra.
3. To regularize calculations, a discrete differential geometry scheme is required, preferably with the same properties as the continuum and correct continuum limit.

A modified version of the model with random distribution of inert sites is considered. The site and pair approximation methods are used to analyze the model, and the effects of inert sites on the phase transitions are investigated.
2. The site approximation results show that the system exhibits a reactive steady state for all values of the concentration of inert sites, with a poisoned state for higher concentrations. The pair approximation results give two solutions, which join together at the spinodal point, and the concentration of reactant molecules remains constant at the spinodal point irrespective of the inert site concentration.
3. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to check the results obtained from the site and pair approximations. The simulations show that the transition between the active and co-poisoned states is of the first order for small concentrations of inert sites, but becomes continuous for larger concentrations. The critical concentration for the continuous transition is found to be @xmath113.

6. PAH cations, which are usually present at lower extinction levels, also represent an important route to form H2 through the addition of the first hydrogen atom, which is barrierless.
7. The further hydrogenation of PAH cations is associated with a barrier if the number of already attached hydrogen atoms is odd, and no barrier if this number is even.

To address problem (a), a wave function parametrized by radiation intensity and other factors is introduced, and the SI second is defined based on the resonance that would be found at absolute zero temperature. Problem (b) is dealt with using computer-mediated feedback that adjusts the oscillator based on detections of scattering of the oscillator's radiation by the atoms.

2. However, MOPED does not accurately represent the true likelihood function in all cases, particularly when dealing with multimodal or degenerate distributions. It was found to fail in the context of light transit analysis, but a solution was presented to still allow for a large speed increase.
3. The authors of the paper report on some limitations of MOPED, specifically in scenarios where it accurately and inaccurately represents the likelihood function. They discuss criteria for when MOPED will accurately represent the likelihood and present a solution for dealing with incorrect peaks.
4. The authors demonstrate MOPED's method through analyzing the spectra of galaxies and the estimation of the CMB power spectrum. They also discuss a solution for the problem of ""badly"" behaved likelihoods in the context of light transit analysis.
5. MOPED assumes the covariance matrix is independent of the parameters, and while it can lead to a speed increase in some cases, it can also result in incorrect peaks in the likelihood function. The authors recommend iterating the parameter estimation procedure and using the algorithm with caution.

1. The cosmological constant problem (CCP) in particle physics refers to the puzzle of explaining the observed vacuum energy density, which is much smaller than theoretical predictions. The problem consists of several pieces, including the existence of various sources of vacuum energy density, the large radiative corrections, and the experimental value of the cosmological constant.
2. In the framework of effective field theory, it is suggested that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy, under the assumption that the classical gravitational fields do not effectively couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy. This conjecture is based on the assumption that external gravitons can couple to gravitational corrections involving internal gravitons.
3. The evolution of dark energy is studied, and it is found that the effective potential including contributions of graviton at one-loop level is much less than the vacuum energy density if the latter is much less than the Planck scale. The zero point energy density given by the graviton loop varies logarithmically on the renormalization point and is identified with the dark energy density. The potential changes after the incorporation of zero point energies of particles and the breakdown of symmetry, and is almost constant except for the early universe. The logarithmically changing energy density is described by the van der Waals type equation of state.

3. The first step of the transition connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state while the probe scans over the desired energy manifold.
4. The non-linear interaction of the lasers generates sub-doppler peaks in the atomic ground state population, which overcome the inconveniences of low signal to noise ratio and non-availability of detectors at the desired wavelength in direct absorption of the probing laser.
5. The text presents two ladder systems and illustrates their different uses by modulating the amplitude of the probe laser for the first system and the frequency of the pump laser for the second system.
6. The frequency modulation of the pump laser and good signal to noise ratio allow for locking the probe laser to the excited atomic resonance in the second system.

1. The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC, specifically the central exclusive production (CEP) process, has attracted significant attention due to its ability to directly observe the quantum numbers of centrally produced particles and measure their mass regardless of decay products.
2. The CEP process involves the protons remaining intact and the central system being separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap, with the central system constrained to be in a color singlet state.
3. Proposals exist to install forward proton detectors either side of the interaction points of ATLAS and CMS, with the FP420 collaboration proposing detectors in the 420 m region to detect central systems in the approximate mass range of 70-100 GeV.
4. The acceptance of the forward detectors is critical to this analysis, with the acceptance governed by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam and the aperture of the LHC beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors.
5. Central exclusive signal and background events are simulated using the EXHUME event generator, with the cross section for the CEP of a standard model Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks shown to be sensitive to the choice of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the soft survival factor.

Power dissipation is also predicted in this dynamical picture.

1. Recent investigations using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) have revealed a complex relationship between galaxy properties (color, luminosity, surface brightness, and concentration) and their environments.
2. Galaxy clustering is a function of both star formation history and luminosity. For low luminosity galaxies, clustering is a strong function of color, while for luminous galaxies, clustering is a strong function of luminosity. For red galaxies, clustering is a non-monotonic function of luminosity, peaking at both high and low luminosities.
3. The investigations also show that galaxy environment is independent of surface brightness and concentration at fixed color and luminosity, indicating that color and luminosity measures of star formation history have a more fundamental relationship with environment.
4. Recent studies have come to conflicting conclusions regarding the dependence on scale of the relationship between galaxy properties and the large scale density field. It is important to examine this issue to test assumptions of the ""halo model"" description of galaxy formation and semi-analytic models that depend only on the properties of the host halo.
5. The text discusses a study addressing the dependence on scale of the relative bias of SDSS galaxies, as well as investigating the environments of galaxies as a function of their luminosity and color. The study finds that the mean density around galaxies declines with scale but the qualitative form of the plot does not change. The results demonstrate that the environments of low luminosity, red galaxies continue to become denser as absolute magnitude increases.

2. In the antiferromagnetic ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations are crucial in both two and three dimensions, reducing the zero-temperature order parameter to nearly 60% of the classical value in two dimensions and the Néel temperature to nearly 70% of the mean-field result in three dimensions for the equivalent quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
3. Recent interest includes spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet. In the random-Xi3 model, the lattice-averaged order parameter appears to be enhanced for small fractions of vacancies, while strong disorder enhances spin fluctuations.
4. A new method is presented for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the hf-level broken-symmetry state using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. The method is applicable in the whole interaction strength range and is illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: the pure model, spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and low-impurity concentrations in the strong coupling limit.
6. The method for obtaining quantum correction to sublattice magnetization solely in terms of transverse spin correlations is parallel to the spin-wave theory approach but differs from the method involving self-energy corrections.

3. Integrable systems are believed to lack thermalization, but recent studies suggest that some quantities in these systems exhibit thermal behavior.
4. The authors study the dynamics of transverse magnetization in a quantum Ising chain by preparing an initial state with inhomogeneity in transverse magnetization.
5. The system is then evolved in the presence of a homogeneous and constant transverse field to investigate whether the transport properties make the magnetization homogeneous and how the magnetization relaxes with time.
6. The authors observe that the magnetization at different sites does not attain the same value, and the underlying dynamics at each site possess two different timescales of oscillation.
7. The smaller timescale contributes insignificant undulations, while the oscillations of larger timescales exhibit generic power-law decay.
8. The exponent of the decay is independent of the strength of the external field and indicates the absence of thermalization.
9. The study also reveals that the frequency of the characteristic oscillation is a monotonic function of the external field in the ordered phase and becomes independent of the field when it crosses the critical value to the disordered phase.

The transition from rocky to non-rocky planets occurs near a planet radius of approximately 1.0 and is very sharp.
2. The presence of stellar companions can change the observed transit depths and, consequently, the derived planetary radii. Assuming all stars in the Kepler candidate list are single can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions. Recent work suggests that a non-negligible fraction of the Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, and the presence of a stellar companion does not necessarily invalidate a planetary candidate but can change the observed transit depths and derived planetary radii.
3. The authors explore the effects of undetected stellar companions on the observed transit depths and resulting derived planetary radii for the entire Kepler candidate sample. They present probabilistic uncertainties of the planetary radii based on expected stellar multiplicity rates and stellar companion sizes. The observed planetary radii will be systematically too small in the absence of spectroscopic or high resolution imaging observations to vet companions, but if a candidate host star is observed with high resolution imaging or radial velocity spectroscopy, the underestimate of the true planet radius is significantly reduced.

5. The force between two plates made out of the same material always attracts, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium. For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed.
6. Parsegian and Weiss derived an equation for the non-retarded van der Waals interaction energy between two dielectrically anisotropic plates immersed in a third anisotropic material.
7. A torque develops between two parallel birefringent slabs placed in an isotropic medium, causing them to spontaneously rotate towards the configuration in which their principal axes are aligned.
8. The casimir-lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has been verified in several high precision experiments, and although most attention has been focused on the interaction between metallic surfaces in vacuum, its general validity is not in doubt.

1. The study of complex networks and random walks on graphs is a central problem in network science, with applications in various fields including computer science, biology, social science, and finance.
2. Random walks on graphs are a sub-class of Markov chains, and the traditional approach deals with the connection of unbiased random walk properties to the spectral features of transition operators associated to the network.
3. The text introduces a new framework for studying topologically biased random walks on graphs, which allows for more efficient exploration of network structure for problems of community detection and synchronization.
4. Biased random walks can be efficiently used for community finding by introducing a set of mathematical tools to investigate the bias parameters space.
5. The paper defines topologically biased random walks (TBRW) and develops the mathematical formalism for tracking the behavior of different biases.
6. The behavior of the spectral gap in biased random walks is studied, and conditions are presented for a maximal spectral gap.

1. Active p2p worms pose a serious threat to the internet by utilizing peer-to-peer (p2p) overlay applications to gain control of vulnerable hosts and spread throughout the network.
2. Passive p2p worms spread by exploiting attractive names in shared folders or by responding to queries with index information. Current patching systems and reputation models can mitigate these threats.
3. Active p2p worms can utilize the p2p overlay to accurately find vulnerable hosts and infect them, or release worms in a hit list of p2p hosts to bootstrap the infection.
4. The p2p overlay provides an accurate way for worms to find more vulnerable hosts without probing randomly selected IP addresses, and the worm attack traffic can easily blend into normal p2p traffic.
5. Our system aims to develop a holistic immunity system to provide both internal defense and external protection against active p2p worms.
6. The system elects a small subset of p2p overlay nodes, called phagocytes, which are immune with high probability and specialized in finding and ""eating"" active p2p worms.
7. Each phagocyte manages a group of p2p hosts and monitors their connection patterns and traffic volume to detect active p2p worm attacks. Once detected, the local isolation procedure cuts off the links of infected p2p hosts and performs contagion-based alert propagation to neighboring phagocytes.
8. The phagocytes also provide access control and filtering mechanisms for the connection establishment between the internal p2p overlay and external hosts. They contain p2p worms in the p2p overlay networks and implement a p2p traffic filtering mechanism to forbid any p2p connections from the p2p overlay to external hosts.
9. The system was evaluated on a massive-scale testbed with realistic p2p network traces, and the results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed holistic immunity system against active p2p worms.

1. The text describes the detection of circumstellar absorption toward the debris disk hd32297 using high resolution optical spectra. Two absorption components are detected toward hd32297, while only one is detected toward its proximate neighbors. The extra absorption component is likely caused by circumstellar material. The ism absorption is similar among hd32297 and its two closest neighbors and is likely due to absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the local bubble. Some variation in local bubble absorption is detected toward 18 ori. Radial velocities of hd32297, bd+07 777s, and bd+07 778 are measured and differ significantly, indicating that they are likely not physically associated. Some indication of temporal variability is detected over several epochs of observations. Instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong ism absorption make a definitive detection of circumstellar variability difficult. The measured circumstellar feature toward hd32297 is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk.
2. An upper limit to the gas mass in the circumstellar disk surrounding hd32297 is estimated using the morphology and abundances of the stable gas component around hd32297 as a proxy. Future observations are planned to continue monitoring the temporal variability of the circumstellar gas toward hd32297 to determine the ratio of stable to variable gas and measure the gas disk absorption to independently measure the gas surface density.

2. Theories of quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimum measurable length, which is largely model-independent.
3. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) breaks down for energies close to the Planck scale, leading to the prediction of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum.
4. The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) is a formulation that holds at all scales and yields equations for uncertainty in position and momentum.
5. The two constants in the GUP equations, related to the Planck mass and energy, are not directly connected through a simple relation.
6. The GUP-induced effects on the planck quantities can be observed only for specific values of the dimensionless parameter.
7. The modified planck density is affected by the quantum gravity corrections, which can be significant for the ratio of the modified planck density to the measured dark energy.
8. The dimensionless entropy enclosed in the cosmological horizon remains unaltered when quantum gravity corrections are taken into account.
9. The analysis of the quantum gravity corrections at the planck time indicates that they extend smoothly to those of the usual Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and may lead to modifications in the framework of cosmology.

2. Recent progress has been made in finding the spectrum of this theory, but much remains to be done for the couplings.
3. At weak coupling, perturbation theory can be used to evaluate couplings, but it is impractical for general operators.
4. A more promising approach is to explore integrability in planar N=4 SYM.
5. The text shows that deforming the theory with a marginal or irrelevant operator introduces new divergences in the renormalized operators, which can be cancelled by renormalizing the operators.

7. The text also mentions the possibility of extending these ideas to other deformations and chiral operators.
8. At strong coupling, the AdS/CFT duality can be used to compute couplings, but it has only been useful for correlation functions of chiral operators.

1. The text describes an embedding scheme for solving the Dirac equation within a limited region i of a larger system ii, where the influence of region ii is taken into account exactly by adding an energy-dependent non-local potential to the Hamiltonian for region i.
2. The scheme is based on a trial function in which continuity in the small component across the surface separating i and ii is imposed variationally. The wave function is expanded in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors, and the problem of variational collapse is avoided by using a basis satisfying kinetic balance.
3. The method is illustrated through calculations of the eigenstates of a hydrogen atom within a spherical cavity and the local density of states on a silver monolayer in an Au(001)/Ag/Au sandwich structure.
4. Future applications of the scheme are expected to be to defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier elements within the framework of density functional theory.

1. Open dielectric resonators have received significant attention due to their applications in microlasers, sensors, and as paradigms of open wave-chaotic systems.
2. The size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths.
3. Semiclassical methods have been successful in treating wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength, providing approximate solutions in terms of the properties of the corresponding classical system.
4. The classical system for open dielectric cavities is an open dielectric billiard, where rays travel freely inside and are partially reflected and refracted at the boundary according to Snell's law and the Fresnel formulas.
5. The field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding billiard, and the far-field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from their ray dynamics.
6. Semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the Goos-Hänchen shift, Fresnel filtering, and curved boundaries are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics.
7. Trace formulas, which relate the density of states (DOS) of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the POs of the corresponding classical system, have been developed for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators and successfully tested in experiments.
8. However, there is no investigation of the trace formula for three-dimensional (3D) dielectric resonators due to the difficulty of solving the full 3D Maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities.

2. The text also compares the results with the formation rate of progenitors and the expected sensitivity of various interferometers, such as LIGO, Virgo, and EGO. The study finds that the contribution of DNS coalescences to the gravitational background is out of reach of the first and second generation of interferometers but could be detected by the third generation of detectors like EGO.
3. The text also mentions the presence of a stochastic background of GWs from various astrophysical sources, such as distorted black holes, bar mode emission from young neutron stars, supernovas, and tri-axial rotating neutron stars. The study estimates the critical redshift at which the background becomes continuous and calculates the coalescence rate per redshift interval.
4. The text concludes by discussing the importance of adequate data analysis strategies for detecting the GW signal from DNS coalescences and the potential of new data analysis techniques, such as the search for anisotropies, maximum likelihood statistic, and methods based on the probability event horizon concept, for distinguishing the GW signal from the instrumental noise background.

1. The text discusses the phenomenon of diffusive acceleration at Newtonian shock fronts and the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock. Three approaches to account for this backreaction are mentioned: numerical simulations, fluid models, and analytical methods.
2. The text introduces a new quantity, the average fluid velocity experienced by particles while diffusing upstream away from the shock surface, which is instrumental to understand the nonlinear backreaction of particles. This velocity is affected by the pressure of the accelerated particles and the diffusion coefficient, which is momentum-dependent.
3. The text presents the solution of the diffusion-convection equation for cosmic rays in the presence of a non-negligible pressure of accelerated particles and discusses the implications for the shock acceleration of seed nonthermal particles. The solution shows that the compression factor at the gas subshock and the total compression factor between upstream infinity and downstream can be significantly larger than in the test particle approximation, leading to a peculiar flattening of the spectra of accelerated particles.
4. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding nonlinear shock reacceleration in astrophysical environments where seed particles are non-negligible, such as in supernova remnants. The text suggests that for some regions of the parameter space, the shock is modified mainly by the backreaction of the seed particles rather than by the cosmic rays accelerated at the shock from the thermal pool. The appearance of multiple shock solutions is also mentioned as a puzzling phenomenon that may suggest that the shock behaves as a self-regulating system settling on the critical point.

1. The text discusses the evidence from type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase, which is attributed to the existence of a dark energy sector with negative pressure. The simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant, which is a form of vacuum energy. However, the cosmological constant problem arises due to the small observational value of dark energy density compared to the expected value from quantum field theories.
2. The text also mentions several alternative dark energy models, such as quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic dark energy, new agegraphic dark energy, and ricci dark energy. Additionally, there are models that induce an effective dark energy through modifications of the gravitational sector itself, such as modified gravity and gravity with higher curvature invariants. One possible alternative theory to explain the accelerated phase of the universe is teleparallel gravity, which describes the gravitational field using the torsion tensor instead of the curvature tensor.

1. The text describes a bidirectional relay network where two users exchange information via a relay node using various protocols under the half-duplex constraint.
2. The simplest protocol is the traditional two-way relaying protocol, which consists of four successive point-to-point phases. In contrast, the time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol and multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol combine certain phases into one, allowing for more efficient use of the wireless medium.
3. The achievable rates of most existing protocols for two-hop relay transmission are limited by the instantaneous capacity of the weakest link associated with the relay due to the fixed schedule of using transmission modes and lack of exploitation of instantaneous channel state information (CSI).
4. An adaptive link selection protocol was proposed for one-way relaying, which selects either the source-relay or relay-destination links based on the instantaneous CSI and achieves the capacity of the one-way relay channel with fading. Power control is also necessary for rate maximization in fading AWGN channels.
5. The goal is to utilize all available degrees of freedom of the three-node half-duplex bidirectional relay network with fading by developing an adaptive mode selection and power allocation policy. This policy selects the optimal transmission mode and allocates the optimal powers to the nodes in each time slot based on the instantaneous CSI and joint power budget.
6. The advantages of buffering come at the expense of increased end-to-end delay, but this delay can be bounded to cause only a small loss in the achieved rate.

1. The acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated based on CMB anisotropy power spectrum measurements.
2. This ""standard ruler"" scale can be measured at low redshifts in large galaxy redshift surveys to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.
3. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB correctly tells us the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, which are robustly measured in the CMB.
4. The sound horizon, which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination, depends only on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality.
5. The baryon-to-photon ratio is exquisitely well measured in the CMB power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the silk damping tail.
6. Measuring the redshift of equality does not imply the matter density if there are other relativistic components, but the dependence of the sound horizon on these components is relatively small.
7. The sound horizon decreases by only 5% if the baryon-to-photon ratio is lowered, and understanding the acoustic oscillations at recombination allows us to translate knowledge of the sound horizon into knowledge of wavelength of the baryonic features in the mass power spectrum.
8. Other cosmological measurements, such as measurements of the potential envelope and the actual values of the densities, are well-poised to measure the actual matter and radiation densities and thereby constrain the presence of unknown relativistic species.

6. If the spacetime admits an extra killing vector corresponding to plane symmetry, the obvious question is what LC represents for values outside the range (0, @xmath10).
7. The absence of circular test particle orbits for small @xmath0 and the fact that most known material sources require @xmath17 led to the belief that LC describes the field of a cylinder only if @xmath0 ranges within (0, @xmath10).
8. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist with circular test particle orbits, and the absence of circular orbits may be due to the requirement of velocities larger than 1 for the test particle.

1. Polymers with large contour lengths greater than their persistence length are described by quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as flexible polymers.
2. For shorter chain lengths, chain stiffness becomes important.
3. Many polymer molecules cannot be modeled by the flexible polymer model developed by Edwards.
4. The standard coarse-graining model of a wormlike polymer was proposed by Kratky and Porod, with essential ingredients being the penalty for bending energy and local inextensibility.
5. Recent studies have shown that the transverse distribution function of a polymer embedded in two-dimensional space possesses a bimodal shape for short polymers, indicating semiflexibility.
6. In this paper, the authors study the transverse distribution function of a three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation using the exact representation of the distribution function in terms of the matrix element of the green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field.
7. The exact solution of the green's function makes it possible to compute quantities such as the structure factor and end-to-end distribution function.
8. The authors find that the transverse distribution function of the three-dimensional wormlike chain possesses the bimodal shape in the intermediate range of chain lengths.
9. The authors also present analytical results for short and long wormlike chains based on the exact formula, which are in agreement with previous results obtained using different methods.

1. The text discusses the concept of closed graphs, which are graphs with a closed labeling. A closed labeling is a bijection between the vertices of a graph and the numbers 1 to n, and it is closed if whenever distinct edges ij and kl have either i or j in common, then j is larger than l.
2. Closed graphs were first encountered in the study of binomial edge ideals, and it was discovered independently in [xcite] and [xcite] that the binomials form a Gröbner basis of the ideal for lex order with respect to the labeling if and only if the labeling is closed.
3. The text also mentions that closed graphs have properties such as being chordal and claw-free, and having a property called narrowness.
4. The goal of the paper is to characterize when a graph has a closed labeling in terms of properties that can be seen directly from the graph.
5. The paper starts by proving that every closed graph is chordal and claw-free ([hprop]).
6. The text then defines narrowness, a property of connected graphs, and states the main theorem that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow ([mainthm]).
7. The paper also mentions that binomial edge ideals are explored in several other papers, and that the paper characterizes closed graphs using the clique complex of the graph and that closed graphs appear in another paper.

1. Cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at the Earth from outside that have a power law energy spectrum which decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy. The highest energy cosmic rays have a quite featureless spectrum and have given birth to particle physics.
2. New progress has been made in understanding different features of inclined showers, which can contribute to the composition issue. Inclined showers can be analyzed to study primary composition, nearly doubling the aperture of any air shower array.
3. The high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum is a complex puzzle, with evidence suggesting a change in the spectral slope and composition above a certain energy. The sources of these high energy cosmic rays are not well understood, and many alternative scenarios have been proposed.
4. The study of inclined showers has the potential to provide valuable insights into the composition of cosmic rays, which is crucial for understanding their origin and properties.

1. Cold atoms in optical lattices is a fusion of quantum gases from atomic physics and laser theory from quantum optics. Optical lattices are artificial crystals of light formed by interference of two or more laser beams, creating one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), or three-dimensional (3D) lattices. Atoms can be cooled and trapped in these lattices, leading to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and the superfluid-to-Mott insulator (sf-mi) transition.
2. Bose-Einstein condensation was first predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924, based on the rules governing the behavior of bosons. The ground state of a bosonic system is reached when almost all particles congregate in the ground state even at a finite temperature. The first BEC was observed in rubidium atoms in 1995, leading to the investigation of various phenomena in condensed matter physics using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

1. The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity. Several sub-families with a wide structural variety are known, all sharing common physical properties such as magnetic behavior.
2. Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is crucial for unveiling the physics underlying the superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated. Disagreements exist regarding the magnetic moments' description (itinerant or localized), the role of correlation effects, and the magnitude of magnetic moments, which is difficult to reproduce within density functional theory and sensitive to computational parameters.
3. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an essential experimental tool for gaining insight into the electronic structure of the iron pnictides. However, it is challenging to deal with the connection between the magnetic phase and the resulting consequences for ARPES due to the formation of twinned crystals during the phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic.
4. To fully understand the electronic properties of the iron pnictide superconductors and get a deeper insight into the influence of the in-plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase, comprehensive studies are mandatory. These studies include the use of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker-Green function (KKR-GF) approach and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with disorder and disorder-induced magnetic moments' evolution.

1. The M31 globular cluster GC B158 contains an X-ray source named XB158, which exhibits strong intensity modulation on a 10017 second (12.78 hr) period.
2. Previous observations from ROSAT and XMM-Newton revealed similar variation in the folded lightcurves, with the amplitude of modulation decreasing with increasing source intensity. No modulation was detected in a 2001 observation.
3. The analysis of the unfolded 2000 June XMM-Newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, with no evidence for dips in the two previous orbital cycles.
4. Three proprietary XMM-Newton observations over 2004 July 17-19 found 1100% dipping for one orbital cycle and zero evidence for dips in other cycles, indicating that the disk was precessing.
5. The precession behavior is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in accreting binaries with mass ratios smaller than 10.3, and is manifested as periodic increases in the optical brightness on a period slightly longer than the orbital period.
6. The Swift XRT observations of XB158 revealed a 30-day, 0.310 keV lightcurve with a factor of 15 variation in luminosity, and no evidence for a dependence of luminosity on off-axis angle. A sinusoidal variation component yielded a much improved fit to the lightcurve, with a period of 5.65 days and an amplitude of 7.1 erg s-1 around a mean luminosity of 1.43 erg s-1.

1. The complex scaling method reveals a resonance state by the appearance of an isolated complex eigenvalue on the spectrum of the non-hermitian complex scaled hamiltonian. However, the analysis of numerical results requires studying the numerical data to decide which result is the most accurate, and most calculations are performed using finite variational expansions.
2. The complex virial theorem and graphical methods can be used to pick the best numerical solution of a given problem, which corresponds to the stabilized points in the trajectories. Other methods to calculate the energy and lifetime of the resonance also have to deal with the problem of which solutions (complex eigenvalues) are physically acceptable.
3. The density of states (dos) method allows obtaining the energy and lifetime of the resonance in a simple way, both quantities being obtained as least square fitting parameters. However, there is no clear criterion to assess the accuracy and convergence properties of the numerical findings, and the method relies on the possibility to calculate the ritz-variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter.
4. The text discusses a method to obtain resonance energies and lifetimes by calculating all the eigenvalues for different basis set sizes and selecting certain values based on some properties of the variational spectrum. The method shows a very regular behavior with the basis set size, which facilitates the use of finite size scaling arguments to analyze the results obtained. The extrapolated values are the most accurate approximation for the parameters of the resonance state that can be obtained with this method.

1. The text discusses the study of two-dimensional (2D) plaquettes inspired by earlier works on 2D Hamiltonian lattices, with the goal of creating 2D symmetric oligomers that may be used as building blocks for larger 2D symmetric lattices. The analysis focuses on stationary modes and their stability against small perturbations, with a particular emphasis on those modes that can be found in an analytical form. The plaquettes are found to have complex eigenvalues and unstable modes, and the study also considers the effect of a more general nonlinearity that includes balanced cubic gain and loss terms.
2. The text also mentions recent developments in nonlinear optics that have led to experimental realizations of 0-symmetric hamiltonians, and discusses the potential implications of these findings for the study of 2D plaquettes. The study is motivated by the fact that realizations of 0-symmetry in nonlinear systems will be inherently endowed with nonlinearity, and there is an intriguing mathematical question regarding the existence, stability, and dynamical fate of nonlinear states in the presence of 0-symmetric perturbations.

1. The cataclysmic variable HU Aqr consists of a 0.80 white dwarf that accretes from a 0.18 main-sequence companion star. Irregularities in the observed-calculated variations led to the discovery of two planets: a 5.7 planet in a 0.013 orbit with an eccentricity of 0.21, and a 7.6 planet in a wider and eccentric orbit.
2. The two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 100,000-year timescale, but some numerical simulations exhibit long-term dynamical stability. It is peculiar to find planets orbiting a binary, particularly around a cataclysmic variable.
3. The presence of planets around HU Aqr and other cataclysmic variables can be used to reconstruct the history of the inner binary. The planets allow for a precision reconstruction of the binary history, and it is assumed they are real for the remainder of the paper.
4. The original binary lost more than half its mass during the common-envelope phase, reducing the binary separation by more than an order of magnitude. It is hard to imagine how a planet (let alone two) could survive such a turbulent past, but their survival offers unique diagnostics to constrain the origin and evolution of the system.
5. The inner planet allows the degeneracy between the donor mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow, its radius, and the mass of its core to be broken, deriving the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase. The outer planet validates this calculation and determines the conditions under which the cataclysmic variable was born.
6. The requirement that the initial binary must have been dynamically stable further constrains the masses of the two stars and their orbital separation. During the cataclysmic variable phase, little mass is lost from the binary system, and the current total binary mass was not affected by the past (and current) cataclysmic variable evolution.

2. The method has been successfully applied to two-body cluster systems and has shown efficiency in various systems. However, it cannot properly describe three-body cluster states, which are essential for studying nuclear systems with such configurations.
3. Recent work has introduced three-body cluster configurations into the method and presented the first results for the @xmath1he ground state and continuum states within a @xmath2he+n+n basis.
4. The extension of the NCSM/RGM approach to properly describe three-body cluster configurations requires expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states.
5. The set of equations obtained from the microscopic Schrödinger equation are mapped onto a system of coupled-channel integral-differential equations and solved using the microscopic r-matrix method.

1. The experimental discovery of skyrmions in non-centrosymmetric compounds with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, specifically in mnsi films on silicon substrates, has attracted scientific interest due to potential applications in spintronic devices.
2. Mnsi films offer magnetic phases of interest and are easy to integrate into devices due to the use of silicon as a substrate material. However, they have a low magnetic ordering temperature below liquid nitrogen temperature.
3. Mnge, a b20 compound with a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure, is a suitable candidate for compounds with similar spin order at higher temperatures.
4. Mnge thin films have been successfully grown on silicon substrates using a mnsi seedlayer, as shown by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations.
5. The magnetic characterization of mnge films revealed an ordering temperature of 200K, an enhancement from mnsi thin films, and a behavior typical for antiferromagnetic order.
6. The resistivity measurements on the 135 film showed it to be metallic with a residual resistivity of 83 cm at 3K and no remarkable features in the magnetoresistivity (MR) effect in the investigated field range.
7. The absence of magnetic phase transitions in moderate magnetic fields and the smallness of the magnetoresistivity in mnge evidences that the helical structure is more rigid than in mnsi, which can be ascribed to a stronger dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
8. The study proved the successful growth of crystalline mnge as a thin film on a si(111) substrate, adopting the b20 structure from a thin seedlayer of mnsi prepared prior to mnge growth.

1. A polynomial @xmath0 is postcritically finite if the forward orbits of its critical points are finite.
2. The filled Julia set of a postcritically finite polynomial contains a forward invariant, finite topological tree called the hubbard tree.
3. The core entropy of a polynomial is the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its hubbard tree.
4. The main goal of the paper is to prove that the core entropy function extends to a continuous function from the set of quadratic polynomials to the real numbers.
5. Thurston first introduced and explored the concept of core entropy of polynomials, which can be defined purely combinatorially but displays a rich fractal structure.
6. Hubbard trees have been used to classify postcritically finite maps and provide a new tool to study the parameter space of polynomials.
7. The restriction of the core entropy to non-real veins of the Mandelbrot set is also monotone, which implies that the lamination for the Mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of the polynomial.
8. The value of the core entropy equals, up to a constant factor, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for the polynomial.
9. For dendritic Julia sets, the core entropy also equals the asymptotic stretch factor of the polynomial as a rational map.
10. The paper develops an algorithm to compute the core entropy of a polynomial using Thurston's algorithm, which involves constructing a power series and encoding possible transitions in a directed graph. The algorithm produces coefficients that vary continuously with the angle, and the result follows by Rouché's theorem.

1. GRBs are most likely of cosmological origin based on the detection of X-ray, optical, and radio afterglows. The fireball model is favored.
2. The degree of beaming in GRBs is still uncertain, making it difficult to determine their energetics. Three methods have been proposed to help determine the degree of beaming: optical afterglow light curves, polarization, and orphan afterglows.
3. Optical afterglow light curves from jetted GRBs are expected to show a break during the relativistic phase due to the collimation of the jet. However, detailed numerical studies suggest that the break is usually quite smooth and may occur at the trans-relativistic phase instead.
4. Orphan afterglows, which are not associated with any detectable GRB, are expected to have a lower rate than the GRB rate. However, it is difficult to measure the GRB beaming angle using orphan searches due to the uncertainty in trigger time and the presence of failed GRBs (fGRBs), which can also manifest as orphan afterglows.

Additionally, the text discusses the concept of fGRBs, which are fireballs with initial Lorentz factors less than 100 but still much larger than unity. These fGRBs can produce orphan afterglows and are proposed to be followed extensively in all bands to check the concept of fGRBs and even test the fireball model under different conditions. The text also mentions that strange stars, which are compact objects composed mainly of u, d, and s quarks, can avoid baryon contamination if GRBs are due to the phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars or collisions of binary strange stars, resulting in very few fGRBs.",1,{'n_points': 4}

2. Two such afterglows were observed using the XMM-Newton satellite: GRB 011211 and GRB 001025.
3. GRB 011211 was detected by BEPPOSAX on December 11, 2001, and was characterized by its long duration and faintness in both x-rays and gamma rays. An optical afterglow was identified and its redshift was measured to be z=2.14.
4. GRB 001025 was detected by RXTE on October 25, 2000, and its optical afterglow was never detected. XMM-Newton observed the location of GRB 001025 from October 27 to October 27.46, starting 151.9 days after the burst.
5. Two x-ray sources were detected in the error box of GRB 001025. The brighter source was analyzed and found to have a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.01 and galactic absorption value of 6.1×10^20 cm^-2.
6. The lack of an optical counterpart for GRB 001025 and the spectral shape of the x-ray source suggest that it is indeed an afterglow of the burst.
7. The x-ray spectra of both GRB afterglows were found to be featureless and did not contain any significant line emission.

1. The study of the layered organic material AI3 has attracted renewed interest due to the presence of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure. AI3 is different from graphene in several aspects, including the tilt of the Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, average fermi velocity, and the presence of additional massive carriers. The effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions is expected to be ten times larger in AI3 than in graphene.
2. The authors present magneto-transport measurements of AI3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than 3 GPa, where Dirac carriers are present. They show the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes, and the interplay between both carrier types at low energy. The measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.

1. Fe-based superconductors (FEBS) represent a class of high-temperature superconductors with unconventional superconducting states. The origin of the latter is still debated, but FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, with iron as the basic element.
2. The Fermi surface (FS) is formed by Fe 3d-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the M point and two electron sheets around the X and Y points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone (BZ). In the two-fe BZ, electron pockets are centered at the Γ point.
3. Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, with maximal scattering near the wave vector equal to M or X in the 1-fe BZ or to Γ in the 2-fe BZ. Different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation result in distinct superconducting gap symmetries and structures.
4. The random-phase approximation spin fluctuation (RPA-SF) approach gives the extended s-wave gap that changes sign between hole and electron FS sheets (d-wave state) as the main instability for a wide range of doping concentrations. Orbital fluctuations promote the order parameter to have sign-preserving symmetry.
5. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure and elucidating the underlying mechanism. There have been reports of a well-defined peak in neutron spectra in 1111, 122, and 11 systems appearing only for Tc or around Tc. The common explanation is that the peak is the spin resonance appearing due to the d-wave state, but recent ARPES and Andreev spectroscopy results suggest the presence of at least two distinct gaps in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LFeAs. The larger gap is about 9 meV and the smaller gap is about 4 meV in BaCo2As2 materials. Electron FS sheets and the inner hole sheet are subject to opening the larger gap, while the smaller gap is located at the outer hole FS. The very existence of the smaller gap raises the question of what would be the spin",1,{'n_points': 5}

1. The presence of impurities in a quantum system can significantly alter its coherence and transport properties. In the absence of interactions, if the impurity distribution is completely random, all states are exponentially localized in dimensions one (1d) and two (2d), while a mobility edge exists in dimensions three (3d).
2. If the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum. This was demonstrated in 1d for the random dimer model (RDM) and the dual random dimer model (DRDM). In 1d, the effects of correlated disorder were studied in various physical contexts. In 2d, the effect of correlations is almost unexplored, except for the case of a speckle potential and for pseudo-2d random dimer lattices with separable dimensions.
3. The 2d extension of the RDM was studied to analyze its localization properties. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) was considered, and it was observed that the states around the resonance energy are delocalized. The effective Hamiltonian for the unperturbed and perturbed cases was schematically illustrated.
4. The system was then considered for a weakly interacting bose gas confined on the 2d square lattice with the 2d-DRDM potential. The ground state wavefunction was found using a Gutzwiller approach, and it was shown that the disorder induces a non-monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength, and enhances both in correspondence of the resonance energy of the 2d-DRDM single-particle Hamiltonian.
5. The dependence of such quantities on the interaction strength was explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion. The results showed that the 2d extension of the RDM introduces a set of delocalized states even at higher dimensions, as in 1d.

2. MDIQKD is a recently proposed QKD scheme where neither Alice nor Bob performs any measurement, but they only send out quantum signals to a measurement unit (Mu). Mu can be an untrusted and completely controlled eavesdropper.
3. MDIQKD is based on a reversed EPR-based QKD protocol and is remarkable because it removes all potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard QKD.
4. The only assumption needed in MDIQKD is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is almost perfect and carefully characterized.
5. The characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit since the characterization of the detection unit involves the estimation of the response of the devices to unknown input signals sent from Eve.
6. Two schemes of phase encoding MDIQKD have been proposed, and their security has been proven with basis-dependent flaw. The first scheme employs phase locking of two separate laser sources, while the second one uses the conversion of phase encoding into polarization encoding.
7. The simulation results imply that the first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy of the state preparation, while the second scheme can cover much longer distances when the state is prepared very precisely.

This scheme can effectively avoid introducing other signals that may disturb the detection of MFs and provides another method for the detection of MFs.

2. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion scenario for SNe Ia, where a WD in a binary system accretes material from the companion, increases its mass, and then explodes. Significant progress has been made in this model, particularly in sustaining stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
3. There are two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. The accreting WD model predicts which companion stars lead to SNe Ia.
4. Observations have not yet confirmed the above evolutionary scenario for SNe Ia, requiring the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site.
5. A possible method to prove that the companion star is located inside the SN ejecta is by observing broad blue wings in the absorption lines of the companion star. This was demonstrated by the absence of such features in the spectrum of a star discovered near SNR 1006.
6. The companion star of Tycho's SNR was proposed to be identified using this method, as the star exhibits absorption lines with broad blue wings in its spectrum. However, uncertainties in the explosion model and the presence of other stars inside the ejecta make the identification challenging.
7. The number of Fe I ions in the freely expanding ejecta is sensitive to the number of ionizing photons emitted from the shocked ejecta. The distributions of O and density in the outer ejecta need to be known precisely to determine if the companion star will exhibit the unique Fe I absorption features discussed in the paper.

1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource in quantum mechanics that can be characterized and manipulated independently of its physical realization. It is useful for making quantitative predictions and obeys conservation laws. However, the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear when quantum systems interact with their environment and result in mixed states.
2. Two measures, entanglement of formation and entanglement of distillation, have been proposed to circumvent the problem of quantifying entanglement in mixed states. These measures evaluate a lower bound and satisfy the requirements for a physical entanglement measure.
3. Nha and Carmichael introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based on quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. This approach considers the way information about the system is read from the environment through measurements and follows the evolution of the system conditioned on the measurement record. The entanglement measure is contextual and dependent on the kind of measurements made.

1. The text discusses the differences between Type 1 and Type 2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) based on angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region.
2. The obscuring dusty medium, commonly referred to as a ""dust torus,"" is optically and geometrically thick and extends from sub-parsec scales to several tens of parsecs or beyond for high luminosity objects.
3. The dust in the torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the received energy in the infrared.
4. Type 1 AGN show significantly more emission in the near-infrared than Type 2 AGN for the same given intrinsic luminosity due to the face-on view onto the torus in Type 1 AGN.
5. The sample used in the study is a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars.
6. The analysis is improved by using host-galaxy subtraction for radio galaxies and clumpy torus models for interpretation.
7. The average spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each subsample representing obscured (Type 2) and unobscured (Type 1) AGN are shown.

1. Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) between Alice and Bob has achieved significant improvements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, but security loopholes remain due to the manipulation domain of the local oscillator (LO), an auxiliary light beam used for balanced homodyne detection.
2. In practical systems, the LO intensity is monitored by splitting a small part with a beam splitter, and pulses with large LO intensity fluctuations are discarded. However, even with monitoring, the effect of LO intensity fluctuations on the secret key rate is not yet fully understood.
3. A new attacking scheme, called a LO intensity attack (LOIA), exploits the LO intensity fluctuations to reduce channel excess noise and obtain partial or full secret keys without being detected.
4. The security of practical CVQKD implementation under LOIA was analyzed, and it was found that the secret key rate decreases rapidly over long distances or small channel transmissions when Eve attacks the LO intensity during key distribution.
5. Eve could obtain partial or full secret keys by controlling the different transmissions of LO, even with a small LO intensity fluctuation or attenuating rate.
6. To mitigate the risk of LOIA, it is essential to monitor the LO intensity carefully and scale measurements with instantaneous intensity values of LO, or scale with the lowest intensity value if the fluctuations are very small, but this will estimate the secret key rate pessimistically.

1. The text discusses the phenomenon of high velocity ionized hydrogen (HI) supershells in galaxies, which have a complex structure marked by cavities, shells, and supershells. These features were first discovered in the Milky Way and have since been observed in several other spiral galaxies.
2. The text describes two main classes of explanations for the formation of HI supershells: internal sources, such as starbursts, and external sources, such as infall of massive gas clouds. The internal source model involves starbursts, stellar winds, and subsequent supernova explosions. The external source model, also known as the chimney model, suggests that the HI supershells are produced by processes related to underlying star formation.
3. The text presents evidence in favor of the chimney model, including the association between extraplanar HI filaments and star forming regions in the disk of NGC 891 and other correlations between halo emission and in-disk tracers of star formation. It also argues that the presence of HI supershells is expected to correlate with the existence of other halo gas, supporting the idea that stellar winds and supernovae are responsible for the HI supershells.
4. The text discusses the difficulties with the starburst model for HI supershells, particularly the required input energies for the largest shells, which often require energy input from staggering numbers of spatially correlated supernova events. It also presents evidence against the star formation processes creating the HI shells, such as the lack of optical evidence for recent star formation in numerous lower energy HI holes and the absence of X-ray and FUV emission.
5. The text proposes a new explanation for HI supershells, suggesting that they have been formed by radio jets which plow through the interstellar medium, accreting ISM gas and sometimes inflating bubbles. This explanation allows for an internal energy source for the HI shells, provides a natural explanation for any spatial symmetries seen in the HI features, and resolves the energy problem.

The quality of the copying can be universal, identical for all states, or state-dependent.

This approach allows for the consideration of cloning mixed states, as any mixed state can be considered as a reduction of a pure state.

2. Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database containing N elements with only O(√N) steps, which is a quadratic advantage over classical search algorithms that require O(N) steps.
3. Grover's algorithm has been realized using various physical systems, including NMR, superconducting qubits, and atom cavity QED systems. Superconducting qubit cavity QED is an attractive approach for quantum information processing due to its strong coupling limit in microwave cavities.
4. The goal of this work is to implement three-qubit Grover's algorithm using four-level squids in cavity QED. A three-qubit phase gate is considered to reduce the number of quantum gates required for the realization of Grover's algorithm.
5. The scheme is based on resonant, off-resonant interaction of the cavity field with the transition of squids and application of resonant microwave pulses. It does not require adjustment of squid level spacing during the implementation of Grover's search iteration, thus suppressing decoherence caused by level spacing adjustment.
6. The implementation of three-qubit Grover search is more complex than the two-qubit case. The scheme uses two lowest energy levels of each squid to represent logical states, and the evolution of the system under the effect of the Hamiltonian is analyzed in the presence and absence of a single photon inside the cavity.

The conduction band (CB) electrons can have various effects on the XPS peak from the core level, with the screening of the core hole leading to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy if the excitation is adiabatic. However, when the excitation is swift, the CB electrons are left in a nonequilibrium state, resulting in plasmon replicas in the spectrum.

Despite this, there is still a low-energy tailing in the system. In the doped case, the 2D character of the system results in 2D plasmons with a completely different dispersion than in ordinary 3D metallic systems, making it challenging to make quantitative interpretations using Doniach and Sunji fitting of the spectra.

1. The fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of stars are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the local group.
2. Spectroscopic surveys like SEGUE, RAVE, GAIA-ESO, and Hermes are used to determine the characteristics of different stellar populations in the Milky Way.
3. Spectroscopic methods are the only way to accurately measure metallicity, which underlies photometric calibrations. High-resolution spectroscopy is also used to correct low-resolution results.
4. The atmospheric parameters can be estimated from a spectrum in a consistent and efficient way, avoiding the problem of reddening inherent in photometry.
5. The spectroscopic parameters can be used alone or in combination with photometric information to fit individual stars to theoretical isochrones or evolutionary tracks to determine their mass, age, and distance.
6. The most common method for deriving spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is to use the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).
7. However, observational and theoretical evidence suggest that systematic biases are present within such analyses due to the breakdown of the assumption of LTE. Recent studies have quantified the effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) on the determination of surface gravity and metallicity, revealing substantial systematic biases in the estimates at low metallicity and/or surface gravity.

1. Weak gravitational lensing effects have been detected in high redshift quasars, intermediate redshift galaxies, and BATSE gamma-ray bursts.
2. In the case of point sources like quasos and gamma-ray bursts, weak lensing manifests itself as angular (anti-)correlations between these sources and foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass.
3. For galaxies, weak lensing is detected through its coherent shear effect.
4. There is another way to detect weak lensing using fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).
5. The authors use the largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia to determine if the observed fluxes have suffered significantly from lensing-induced (de-)amplifications.
6. They use apm galaxies as tracers of foreground mass density and find that the median redshift of the 55 SNe Ia in their sample is 0.21, and only 50 of these sources are used in the analysis due to cuts in the data.
7. The authors find that brighter SNe Ia have an excess of galaxies in their foregrounds, and the statistical significance of this relation is 2.
8. The angular radii of the foreground regions where this effect is observed are 5-15 arcmin, which correspond to non-linearly evolved intermediate-scale structures.
9. The authors cannot rule out the possibility of galactic dust obscuration as an alternative explanation for the observed relation between SNe Ia and foreground galaxies, but find that it is unlikely based on current observations.

Additionally, the authors investigate the impact of weak lensing on the determination of global cosmological parameters using SNe Ia standard candles and find that the distribution of SNe Ia in foreground galaxy density is indistinguishable from uniform, indicating that lensing effects by large-scale structures probably did not bias the derived values of the cosmological parameters.",1,{'n_points': 9}

1. Lanthanide-based heavy fermion metals exhibit distinct behavior due to strong spin-flip scattering from localized 3d-levels, leading to large effective masses and low-energy scales indicative of strong interactions.
2. The low-temperature state is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened spins, crossing over to essentially incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering.
3. Physical properties of heavy fermion materials are typically anomalous, with non-monotonic temperature-dependence of resistivity and rich optical structure from the microwave to the near infrared.
4. Theoretical treatments of heavy fermion materials center on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.
5. The absence of exact results has spurred the search for suitable approximation schemes, with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) being a major impact in recent years.
6. DMFT is formally exact in the large-dimensional limit, but still retains full temporal dynamics and maps all lattice models onto an effective single-impurity model with a self-consistently determined host.
7. The LMA approach, which has been developed to encompass the Anderson lattice (PAM), provides a many-body description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic heavy fermion materials.
8. The LMA approach introduces the notion of local moments from the outset, leading to a two-self-energy description that readily captures correlated spin-flip dynamics.
9. The LMA approach has been shown to give good agreement with NRG calculations for dynamics and known exact results for static magnetic properties in the single-impurity Anderson model.
10. The LMA approach has recently been extended to handle the generic asymmetric PAM and hence heavy fermion metals, enabling the study of single-particle dynamics and their thermal evolution in the strongly correlated regime.

2. The mean-field wormlike chain (mf-wlc) model is used to understand the effect of tension on the looping time, which shows an exponential increase for short chain lengths due to the increasing free energy of loop formation.
3. In the presence of dichotomic tension, the looping time shows a minimum at an optimal flipping time, and the probability of the dichotomic force being negative at the instant of looping has a maximum near the mean flipping time.
4. The resonant activation (ra) phenomenon is observed in polymer looping in the presence of dichotomic tension, where the looping time is the minimum when the flipping time is comparable to the diffusion time of a brownian particle in the free energy barrier.
5. The study suggests that a biopolymer can self-organize optimally utilizing the ambient nonequilibrium fluctuations, and further experiments using dichotomically fluctuating tension with various flipping times are called for to establish the ra phenomena in polymer loop formation.

They also show that planets with short orbital periods around stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses will fall onto the stellar surface in the main sequence lifetime of the star.

1. Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of band insulators preserving time reversal symmetry, characterized by non-trivial topological invariants, and have been extensively studied due to the existence of robust surface metallic states.
2. TIs are typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction, and all known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements.
3. It has been proposed that mutual coulomb repulsions among electrons can generate effective spin-orbit couplings, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological mott insulator (TMI).
4. The TMI phenomenon is unusual because it shows an unconventional quantum criticality that depends on the electron band dispersion near the Fermi point.
5. However, achieving this proposed topological phase in real materials has not been achieved, and it is not clear whether TMIs become stable against competing orders and quantum fluctuations.
6. Long-period charge density waves (CDWs) are a competing order that severely competes with TMIs on the honeycomb lattice.
7. By reducing the fermi velocity of the dirac cones, TMIs can be stabilized on the honeycomb lattice.
8. The extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been studied to realize TMIs by controlling the fermi velocity and employing a variational Monte Carlo method with many variational parameters. By suppressing the fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice, the TMI emerges in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking even when many-body and quantum fluctuations are taken into account.

Polyelectrolytes have repulsive intra-chain electrostatic interactions that tend to swell the chain, while polyampholytes have attractive interactions between charged monomers of opposite sign that tend to decrease the chain size.
2. The text describes the properties of polyelectrolyte brushes, including their dependence on grafting density and charge fractions, and the effect of electrostatic interactions on counterions and chain conformations. Polyelectrolyte brushes can form a polymer brush regime where most counterions are trapped inside the brush and the thickness is determined by competition between osmotic pressure and elasticity.
3. The text also discusses the simulation method used to study planar brushes of flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike diblock polyampholytes using molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the average brush thickness linearly depends on the grafting density for all types of chains, but the strength of this dependence is weaker for flexible chains.

The paper deals with the structural properties of the networks and their attractors, introducing the concept of relevant elements and studying their probability distribution.

The authors focus on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy and find that it shows a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields.
2. The authors also investigate the dependence of the spectra of the superflow kinetic and spin-dependent interaction energy on the relative velocity and find that the period sustaining the Kolmogorov spectrum in the superflow kinetic energy becomes shorter when the relative velocity is large due to the modulation of the total density and high energy injection wave number. In contrast, the spin-dependent interaction energy can exhibit the 1-power law independently of the relative velocity.

1. Low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) make up about 40% of nearby bright galaxies and are defined by a luminosity of @xmath1. Their low luminosities are thought to be caused by very low accretion rates onto super-massive black holes.
2. The accretion is often explained by the model of an optically-thin disc, such as an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), rather than an optically-thick disc. The ADAF model predicts a ""submillimetre bump"" in its spectral-energy distribution (SED), while the standard disc is responsible for a big-blue bump in the SED of luminous AGNs.
3. The first imaging investigations for accretion discs must be promising with future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments that will provide micro-arcsec resolutions. The observational evidence of the ADAF is crucial in the LLAGN radio sources.
4. Although the ADAF model successfully explains the broadband spectra of LLAGNs, there is a significant gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum, especially at low-frequency radio bands. This indicates that additional unknown emission exists and may be buried under it.
5. Millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs were reported in the present paper. A high-frequency observation is very promising to detect the inverted spectrum of the ADAF because of its advantages in being less affected by non-thermal jets and predicting larger flux densities at higher frequencies.
6. The present paper is structured into sections on sample selection, observations and data reduction, results, discussion, and summary. The sample, called the ""vlbi-detected LLAGN sample,"" covers 20 out of 25 all-known LLAGN radio sources that have been detected with VLBI.
7. The authors made millimetre continuum observations for 16 out of 20 targets using the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and reported millimetre survey and submillimetre data analyses for many LLAGNs. They found that the inverted spectra of the ADAF are not caused by resolution effects but intrinsic properties of the cores.

The model is characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, including the Kondo scale, the coherence temperature, and the RKKY interaction energy scale.
2. The KLM is solved using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), which retains temporal fluctuations and accounts for the Kondo effect but neglects spatial fluctuations on a length scale larger than the cluster size. The DCA is implemented using the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method with delayed updates to enhance performance.
3. The KLM is found to exhibit a magnetic order-disorder transition between insulating states, which is assumed to belong to the three-dimensional universality class. However, due to the small cluster sizes considered in the DCA, the physics of this transition cannot be captured.
4. Within the magnetically ordered phase, the single-particle spectral function is found to compare well with the exact lattice QMC results, indicating that the DCA is a well-suited approximation for use with the KLM.
5. The evolution of the lower band in the KLM is studied as a function of coupling and next-nearest neighbor hopping, revealing a continuous change in band structure that maps onto a topology change of the Fermi surface at small dopings away from half filling.
6. The results of the study are summarized in a magnetic phase diagram, which shows the evolution of the Fermi surface topology from a large Fermi surface in the paramagnetic phase to a small Fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic metallic phase.

The study showed that the difference between atomic and molecular lines in the spectrum of bpm 27606 is formally 0.5, with the same uncertainties due to pressure shifts as before. Based on the absence of relative shifts between the electronic and the vibrational transitions of the swan bands, upper bounds on the Higgs-Kreschmann coupling were assessed.

The luminosity variations in these elm wds are consistent with surface temperature variations caused by non-radial mode pulsations driven to observability by a hydrogen partial ionization zone.

Empirically discovering elm wds in this space that do or do not pulsate opens the possibility to use the presence of pulsations in elm wds to constrain binary and stellar evolution models used for low-mass wds, which may better constrain the poorly understood CNO-flashing episodes.

2. The link between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution relies on understanding the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas develops. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds.
3. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity far below its mean. The atomic-to-molecular transition occurs in photodissociation regions (PDRs), and the structure and chemistry of these regions have been extensively studied.

Simulations of the ISM have attempted to replicate a supernova-driven ISM, finding success in reproducing a multiphase ISM or demonstrating the regulation of the star formation rate by stellar feedback.

This feature, labeled the vertical extension of the red clump (VRC), has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars or tidal debris.
2. The authors argue against the VRC being a stellar evolutionary feature based on the difference in color between the VRC and the red clump peak and the lack of a parallel main sequence shifted by 0.9 mag in the LMC cmd. However, they later acknowledge that allowing for a small range in the ages of young stars in the red clump can reproduce the vertical extent of the VRC without significantly modifying its color.
3. The authors confirm the presence of the VRC in all their LMC fields and conclude that it is due to stellar evolution, specifically younger core he-burning stars in the clump. They also find that the same stellar evolutionary models reproduce the VRC feature in the solar neighborhood cmd and can account for up to 175% of the stellar density of the VRC compared to the upper main sequence with a Salpeter imf.

2. Multi-nucleon events are important for charge-changing quasielastic cross sections at typical neutrino energies of 3-10 GeV.
3. Two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations are essential for a proper description of data.

5. The frozen nucleon approximation is a fast and efficient method to calculate the inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model.
6. The frozen nucleon approximation assumes that the momenta of the initial nucleons can be neglected for high enough values of momentum transfer.
7. The frozen nucleon approximation reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 to 1.

1. The text describes the optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), h 0507 + 164, using the reverberation mapping technique to estimate the black hole mass.
2. The observations were carried out at the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) for about a month, and the data reduction was performed using standard procedures in IRAF and Midas.
3. The analysis revealed that the continuum and hα fluxes vary, while the [O III] line is nearly constant. The time lag between the continuum and hα variations was estimated to be about 4 days using the discrete correlation function method.
4. The line dispersion of the broad emission component of hα was measured to be 66 km/s, and the black hole mass was estimated to be 1.2 × 10^6 M☉ using the virial equation and the scaling factor from Onken et al. (2004).
5. The results are consistent with the established relationship between the black hole mass and the AGN luminosity, and the study contributes to the growing body of evidence for the evolutionary connection between the growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies.

1. Broad emission iron lines are features found in the spectra of about two dozen active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, believed to originate close to the black hole from the reflection of primary radiation on the accretion disc.
2. The spin of the black hole plays an important role in determining the position of the marginally stable orbit, which confines the inner edge of the accretion disc. The innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value.
3. The LAOR model, which includes the effects of a maximally rotating Kerr black hole, has been widely used for over two decades to model relativistic disc spectral lines. However, it sets the dimensionless angular momentum to a canonical value, limiting its use in data fitting.
4. Recent models have relaxed this limitation and allowed the angular momentum to be fitted, enabling more accurate modeling of the broad iron line. Other numerical codes have also been developed independently with similar functionality.
5. The aim of the study is to compare the LAOR and other relativistic line models using the current XMM-Newton data and artificial data for the upcoming X-ray mission. Two sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, which exhibit an extremely skewed iron line, have been chosen for analysis.
6. The XMM-Newton data for MCG-6-30-15 was obtained during a long 350ks exposure time, while the data for GX 339-4 was obtained during a 2.25ks observation in the burst mode due to a very high source flux. Both sources are well described by a continuum model plus a broad iron line model.
7. The study compares the modeling of the broad iron line by the LAOR and other relativistic models and finds that the other model leads to a better defined minimum for the best fit value and more regularly shaped confidence contour plots. However, the LAOR model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution.
8. The study also finds that the correct re-binning of the data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution is crucial to obtain statistically relevant results.

2. The method involves disregarding the part of space with singularities and using the surface to make an inversion of the nonsingular part of the space, resulting in a space with a singularity that is a delta function with support on the surface.
3. The Einstein field equations separate into two pieces: one valid for the usual Einstein equations and another involving distributions with an associated energy-momentum tensor, with support on the surface.
4. The article applies the formalism to obtain the simplest model of a disk based on Schwarzschild's vacuum solution in isotropic coordinates, resulting in a disk with surface energy density and radial and azimuthal pressures.
5. The article also presents models of disks with halos obtained from different known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates.
6. The generated disks have positive energy density and equal radial and azimuthal pressures (perfect fluid), and the surface energy density and pressures decrease monotonically and rapidly with radius.
7. The disks become more relativistic as the ""cut"" parameter decreases, with surface energy density and pressure more concentrated near the center. Regions of unstable circular orbits are more likely to appear for high relativistic disks.
8. The sound velocity in the fluid and the tangential velocity of test particles in circular motion are less than the velocity of light. The tangential velocity first increases with radius and reaches a maximum, then decreases for large radii in case of disks generated from Schwarzschild and Buchdahl solutions.
9. The sound velocity is also a decreasing function of radius, except in solution npv 2a with @xmath184, where it reaches its maximum value at the boundary. Other solutions of static spheres of perfect fluid could be used to generate other disk+halo configurations, but it is not guaranteed that the disks will have the characteristics of normal fluid matter.

1. The text discusses the creation and properties of domain walls in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system, where two species of atoms condense simultaneously. The domain walls are solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations and are characterized by a change in the relative phase between the two condensates. The walls are metastable and can decay via hole nucleation, with the decay rate being exponentially suppressed.
2. The text also explores the possibility of creating domain walls in experiments by manipulating the traps to prepare a state where the two condensates flow in opposite directions. The domain walls are then created when the coupling drive is turned on, and their properties, such as width and separation, can be controlled by adjusting the initial relative motion of the condensates and the final values of the coupling drive.

1. Anomalies in field theory occur when a symmetry or conservation law valid in the classical theory is violated in the quantized version. These anomalies play a fundamental role in physics and can lead to inconsistencies in the quantum theory.
2. External symmetries, such as those related to translations or rotations, do not pose a danger to the consistency of the theory and can provide explanations for physical phenomena like particle decay or the solution to certain problems in quantum chromodynamics.
3. Internal symmetries, specifically gauge symmetries, can lead to inconsistencies in the quantum theory. The anomalous Ward identities destroy the renormalizability of the theory and can also cause the loss of unitarity in the S-matrix.
4. The study of anomalies began in the late 1960s with the work of Adler, Bell, Jackiw, and Bardeen. The anomalies can be found within perturbation theory and have been calculated using various methods, including the heat kernel method, Fujikawa's path integral approach, and modern mathematical techniques such as differential geometry and cohomology.
5. Schwinger terms, which are extensions to the canonical algebra of equal time commutators of the Gauss law operators, are deeply related to anomalies. They can be described cohomologically and geometrically and have been calculated within perturbation theory.
6. The authors of this work focus on calculating the gravitational anomalies, specifically the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, using the method of dispersion relations. They choose to work in the case where the Lorentz anomaly is vanishing for convenience.
7. The purpose of the work is to demonstrate that all the anomalous features can be obtained using the method of dispersion relations, which is an independent and complementary view of the anomaly phenomenon compared to ultravariant regularization procedures.

2. The mission consists of two parts: the Space Time Explorer, which measures the gravitational red shift experienced by highly accurate clocks in the gravitational fields of Earth or the Sun, and the Quantum Equivalence Space Test, which measures differential accelerations of microscopic quantum particles to test the universality of free fall.
3. The mission objectives include measuring the gravitational red shift of Earth and the Sun to a fractional frequency, testing the universality of free fall, and achieving high measurement accuracy and stability.
4. The mission design includes a highly stable bi-directional microwave and optical link system that connects the space and ground segments, allowing for precise time and frequency transfer.
5. The space segment includes the satellite, two instruments, science link equipment, and precise orbit determination equipment. The ground segment is composed of three ground terminals connected to highly accurate ground clocks.
6. Earth gravitational red shift measurements are performed by comparing the frequency output of the on-board clock to that of ground clocks, with a highly elliptical orbit chosen to maximize the signal.
7. Sun and moon gravitational red shift measurements are performed by comparing the relativistic frequency offset between a pair of ground clocks while the spacecraft serves as a link node between them.
8. Atom interferometer measurements do not require contact to ground terminals but must be performed in close proximity to Earth where gravity gradients are large and the etvs parameter can be measured to test the weak equivalence principle.

2. The origin of dark energy is being clarified by understanding its connection to particle physics, specifically through the Mavans scenario where relic neutrinos form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration.
3. In this model, an unknown scalar field called the ""acceleron"" is introduced, and neutrinos are assumed to interact through a new scalar force. The neutrino mass depends on the number density and changes with the evolution of the universe.

The possible phases of QCD and the critical boundaries or points are being actively studied, with revealing the QCD phase transition structure being a central aim of ongoing and future research. The text mentions that the study of hot and dense nuclear matter in the form of QGP has been ongoing for about thirty years, with experiments at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) attempting to create QGP and obtain hints of its formation.
2. The text also presents a calculation for evaluating the energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP using the Landau Fermi liquid theory. The calculation considers the one gluon exchange interaction and takes into account the pressure of the excluded volume hadron model to find the corresponding QGP transition phase diagram. The paper is organized into sections reviewing the derivation of one gluon exchange interaction formulas, calculating thermodynamic properties of QGP, and presenting results and comparison with strange quark matter.

Additionally, the text mentions that the Landau Fermi liquid theory describes relativistic systems such as nuclear matter, quark matter, quark-gluon plasma, and other relativistic plasmas. The theory provides formulas for evaluating the energy density of weakly interacting quarks in QGP, which involves the degeneracy of quarks, kinetic and potential energies, and the Landau-Fermi interaction function. The text also explains that the potential energy for massless quarks is always positive, making the interaction between quarks inside the bag repulsive and helping them penetrate from the bag more easily. The internal energy density of QGP is evaluated by performing the summation over the interacting and non-interacting parts of the energy density of quarks, vacuum energy, and gluon energy density.

3. A symmetric second-order tensor field was defined as the metric for flat space-time, coupling to electromagnetism.

The measurements reveal a fourfold oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity below a critical temperature (Tc) due to the presence of a predominant d-wave gap symmetry.
2. The text also explains that the thermal conductivity patterns are influenced by the temperature dependence of the gap, the relative increase of the inelastic scattering rate, and the competition between thermal activation of quasiparticles in the direction of the thermal current and the gap structure.
3. The authors use a two-dimensional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) model to explain the experimental results, which assumes a d-wave pairing symmetry and takes into account the effects of impurities, phonons, and quasiparticles scattering. They find that the model reproduces the symmetry of the curves in the measured temperature range quite well.
4. The authors also note that the anisotropy of the s-wave gap proposed for BSCCO does not seem to occur in YBCO, as the nodes are observed at both field orientations. They also discuss the temperature dependence of the inelastic scattering rate and compare it to thermal hall angle measurements in the same YBCO twinned crystal.

1. Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have received attention due to their calculable soft supersymmetry breaking terms, real and flavor invariant soft terms, and renormalization group invariant soft terms. However, they suffer from negative slepton mass-squared parameters, which can be solved by adding a universal scalar mass.
2. Hypercharged anomaly-mediation (HCAMSB) is a string-motivated scenario that uses a similar setup as AMSB but localizes supersymmetry breaking at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region. The warping suppresses tree-level gravity and anomaly mediation contributions, making the anomaly mediation the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector, except for the bino mass.
3. The bino mass can lead to a small perturbation or the largest soft supersymmetry breaking parameter in the visible sector, depending on its size. It can affect the spectrum of anomaly mediation through renormalization group evolution. In extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), additional singlets can communicate supersymmetry breaking to the MSSM sector.
4. Anomaly mediation and hypercharge mediation cure phenomenological shortcomings of each other. The minimal AMSB model predicts negative mass squared for sleptons and relatively heavy squarks, while the pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms and relatively heavy sleptons. The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions.
5. The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if the bino mass is not too large, due to the presence of chargino and neutralino candidates in cascade decay events. The mass ordering in the hCAMSB model gives rise to a crucial distinction in lhc susy cascade decay events, which may serve to distinguish the two models.

2. The authors find that the local LF of galaxies, when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields, agrees well with the Large Area Survey (LAS) and the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). However, the normalization of the local LF is roughly a factor of 1.6 higher than that of the Stromlo/APM survey.
3. The authors observe evolution of the field galaxy LF within their sample, confirming the conclusions drawn from several previous redshift surveys. The evolution is limited to the population of blue, star-forming galaxies, which become more luminous with increasing redshift.
4. The LFs of the two superclusters show significant differences from the field galaxy LF, despite considerable overall similarity. The most prominent difference is an excess of very bright galaxies relative to the best-fitting Schechter function, which accurately describes the field LF over the observed absolute magnitude range. These very bright galaxies are found in very dense regions of the superclusters and have spectra dominated by an old, red stellar population.
5. The authors suggest that the excess of very bright galaxies in the superclusters may be due to the influence of the environment on galaxy formation and evolution. They also present suggestive evidence for a sharp upturn in the supercluster LF for faint galaxies, while there is also a suggestion of an upturn in the local field galaxy LF for the least luminous galaxies in their survey.

3. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events with jet transverse energies greater than 100 GeV and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets.
4. The observation of color singlet exchange effects at momentum transfers of order 1,000 GeV raises hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions.

1. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB with properties of a Z-source, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
2. It is one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known but has a low X-ray flux due to its extra-galactic nature.
3. The optical counterpart was identified as a B-type star with a magnitude of 18.5.
4. The orbital period is uncertain, ranging from 6.4 hours to 12 days, and no periodic variability was detected in 6 years of MACHO data.
5. A new technique called bowen fluorescence was used to detect narrow emission lines in the bowen region, giving the first constraints on the system parameters.
6. The radial velocity curve shows a sine-like variation, suggesting orbital motion, and two significant peaks were found in the power spectrum, one at a period of 0.32 days, which is similar to the photometric period detected by Callanan et al. (1990).
7. The emission lines are dominated by HeII, but the bowen emission is much weaker compared to HeII in LMCX-2, possibly due to the much lower metal abundances in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
8. The most striking difference between the spectra is the dramatic change of Hα, which is dominated by a weak emission feature superposed on a broad absorption feature during the first night and has become almost as strong as HeII during the second night.
9. The helium lines have also become more prominent during the second night, but it is not clear if they have all changed by the same amount.
10. The lightcurve shows a decrease in continuum flux during the second night, which is similar to the decrease in line fluxes of the HeII lines and bowen region, suggesting a common origin.

1. The text discusses the axial anomaly in quantum field theory and its interpretation as an infrared phenomenon. The authors extend the approach of Dolgov and Zakharov to study the radiative pion decay and interpret the presence of a term independent of the lepton mass in the corresponding cross sections as a manifestation of the axial anomaly.
2. The authors analyze the cancellation of mass singularities in polarized processes and show that the helicity flip cross section does not vanish in the chiral limit, indicating the action of a cancellation mechanism similar to the one in the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram. They also discuss the implications of the KLN theorem and the differences between the pion decay and a more general lepton-antilepton pair decay.

1. Ozsvath and Szabo constructed Heegaard Floer theory, a decorated topological quantum field theory in 0-dimensional manifolds, called Heegaard Floer theory.
2. In its simplest version (called HF), to a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold and a 2-structure on it, one associates a vector space over the field and to a connected, oriented four-dimensional cobordism decorated with a 2-structure, one associates a map.
3. The maps can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on manifolds with boundary. For example, the Heegaard Floer invariants of two homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic four-manifolds, Heegaard Floer 18 and Heegaard Floer 19, are different.
4. The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces.
5. Sarkar and the third author showed that every three-manifold admits a nice heegaard diagram, which is a heegaard diagram with curves that split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles.
6. The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps when the cobordism satisfies certain homological hypotheses and the induced maps are surjective.
7. The computation of the ranks of the maps goes as follows: the cobordism is decomposed into a sequence of one-handle additions, two-handle additions, and three-handle additions. Using homological hypotheses and the ℤ37-action on the Heegaard Floer groups, the problem is reduced to the case of a cobordism map corresponding to two-handle additions only.
8. Given a cobordism made of two-handles, it can be represented by a multi-pointed triple heegaard diagram of a special form, in which all elementary domains that do not contain basepoints are bigons, triangles, or rectangles. In such diagrams, all holomorphic triangles of Maslov index zero can be counted algorithmically, thus giving a combinatorial description of the map on the symmetric product.

1. The aim in physics is to understand the physical picture behind phenomena, not just calculate observables.
2. In some cases, theories formulated in terms of fundamental degrees of freedom cannot answer certain questions due to complexity at related scales.
3. The essential degrees of freedom for understanding electric conductivity, heat capacity, etc. in crystals are ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interaction.
4. In QCD, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is the most important phenomenon for understanding the nucleon mass and its low-energy properties.
5. Beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks interacting by the exchange of goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.
6. The chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to a lower symmetry by the QCD vacuum in the large limit.
7. Evidence for spontaneously broken chiral symmetry includes a nonzero value of the quark condensates for light flavors, which is confirmed by current algebra, QCD sum rules, and lattice gauge calculations.
8. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry results in the appearance of an octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass and the acquisition of dynamical mass by valence quarks, which have been called constituent quarks.
9. The flavor-octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit implies a coupling between constituent quarks and pseudoscalar goldstone bosons, which is a quark analog of the Goldberger-Treiman relation.

1. The text discusses an invention in the field of seat base support assemblies for furniture, specifically for non-coil spring types such as sinuous band seat spring assemblies.
2. Over the past decade, furniture seat springs have relied on torsioning devices and swing anchor connecting links due to the need for deep-drop uplift and the increasing cost of helical spring connectors.
3. However, with the trend towards thicker cushions and lower seat frame heights, there is a need for more upward resilience in the spring base.
4. The present invention aims to provide a new and improved rail connector for sinuous spring bands, wire grids, chord-rubber webbing, and flexible steel bands.
5. The rail connector embodies the features of conventional helical spring connectors while avoiding their undesirable aspects.
6. It produces spring torsioning and dynamic uplift at the back rail through kinetic energy stored in the connector itself.
7. The rail connector offers varying degrees of dynamic uplift resilience by providing alternative spring action modes.
8. The first form of the rail connector uses a pre-stressed, close-wound coil spring with attachment arms. It can be wound on an axis transverse or longitudinal to the axis of expansion and contraction of the connector.
9. The second form of the rail connector uses a pre-stressed, cantilever spring configuration. It can be used with a sinuous spring band having leverage-amplified torsioning incorporated therein.
10. The invention provides seat spring-enhancing connectors that combine the four essential seat-force-generators: torsioning, dynamic uplift, expansion-contraction, and leverage-amplification, resulting in the four most desired seat-performance characteristics.

1. The present invention is a system for controlling the fuel delivery system of a vehicle, which can be switched between automatic and manual control. The system comprises a control unit, a throttle valve, a DC motor or stepper motor, and a clutch. The control unit receives signals indicating accelerator pedal position and throttle valve position, and processes these signals to provide a control signal to the DC motor or stepper motor, which sets the throttle position for optimum vehicle performance. The control unit also provides an output signal which controls the clutch, allowing the vehicle driver to manually control the throttle valve position when desired.
2. During manual control, the vehicle driver has full control of the vehicle, and changing control from automatic to manual does not occur until the throttle valve is moved to a predetermined position or matches the command of the accelerator pedal. This prevents the vehicle from lurching forward or stalling when control is shifted. The system can also be used in conjunction with a continuously variable transmission, allowing for manual control at high transmission ratios and automatic control at low ratios.

1. The text describes an invention related to a mounting link between an engine and a gearbox, which includes a male link, a female link, and a pin. The female link receives the male link to allow translation and forms a radial interface, which dampens the translation and selectively retains the links with the pin.
2. The mounting link is designed to absorb extreme shocks without detaching the gearbox from the engine or transmitting destructive loads. The female link and male link translate relative to each other after the pin is broken or released, and the radial interface provides coulomb damping to dissipate energy.
3. The pin can serve as a fusible link and shear at a known load magnitude to prevent damage to the gearbox and its attached peripherals. The materials and geometry of the links and the contact areas determine the amount of coulomb damping.
4. The use of the pin and coulomb damping obviates the need for all linkages and peripheral connections to survive extreme loads, reducing weight and mass. The pin can be replaced during maintenance following any shock sufficient to break it.

An oxide film is deposited and anisotropically etched to form a mask for the high density n-type region.
3. The problem with the conventional method is the difficulty in determining the proper termination time for the anisotropic RIE, which affects the width of the oxide portion on the gate sidewall and can result in etching away the source/drain region.
4. The invention provides a method for forming the oxide portion on the sidewall of the gate, which improves the controllability of its width and prevents the source/drain from being etched away.
5. In the first embodiment, a conformal layer is formed on the insulating film and anisotropically etched to leave a portion on the gate sidewall. The high density n-type region is then formed using this portion as a mask.
6. In the second embodiment, the oxide film is formed on the gate sidewall using the insulating film as a mask, and then the high density n-type region is formed using this oxide film and the insulating film on the gate as a mask.
7. In the third embodiment, the oxide film portion on the gate sidewall, which is used as a portion of the mask for ion injection, is formed of a high melting point metal or a silicide of such a metal.
8. In the fourth embodiment, a conductive layer or polycrystalline semiconductor layer is formed after the insulating film is deposited on the gate electrode, which is then anisotropically etched away to form the portion on the gate sidewall.
9. The method also includes siliciding a desired portion of the gate electrode or the gate electrode and the source/drain region in fabricating the insulated gate field effect semiconductor device having the LDD structure.

2. A power system includes a battery with plurality of cells and a controller that causes cells to acquire charge for a period of time, allowing voltages to approximate equality at the end of the period.
3. The rate at which charge is acquired by cells may differ for some cells during a determined portion of the period.
4. A battery cell's maximum capacity can be found using the relationship between change in capacity, change in state of charge, and voltage.
5. A battery cell's energy content can be approximated using the power applied to the cell over time and the voltage and current associated with the power stored.
6. The power provided by each cell is contributing to the total output power of the string, and cells with greater Amp-hr capacity contribute more power and energy.
7. To ensure all cells have enough energy to meet the vehicle trip requirements, the cells should be charged to a voltage based on the minimum Amp-hr cell, but not so low that the minimum cell cannot provide enough energy for the trip.
8. The time required to charge the battery pack depends on the cell requiring the greatest ΔIhrs, the cell requiring the least ΔIhrs, the method of balancing cells, and the portion of the charge cycle selected for balancing.
9. Cell voltage balancing to achieve a target drive range involves determining the voltages of each cell, maximum capacity of each cell, common voltage needed for each cell, charge time for the battery pack, and resistive circuitry activation time for each cell. The controller then balances and charges the cells using any suitable technique or activates the resistive circuitry for each cell and deactivates it when the activation time expires. Once all resistive circuitry has been deactivated, the battery charger is disabled, and the cells have been balanced and charged to a target voltage sufficient to support a desired drive range.

2. The federal government, however, has not fully leveraged its aggregate buying power due to the decentralized nature of procurement, resulting in hundreds of separate contracts and varying prices for commonly used items. In response, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum in 2005 to encourage agencies to aggregate requirements, streamline processes, and coordinate purchases of like products and services.
3. The Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) was established in 2005 to address government-wide opportunities to strategically source commonly purchased products and services and eliminate duplication of efforts across agencies. Four ongoing efforts focused on office supplies, domestic delivery of packages, telecommunications, and print management, and three planned efforts related to SmartBUY, Wireless plans and devices, and publication licenses.
4. Despite these efforts, most agencies leveraged only a fraction of their buying power through strategic sourcing, with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and Department of Veterans Affairs accounting for 80% of the $537 billion in federal procurement spending but managing only 5% of that spending. The FSSI program reported managing $339 million through several government-wide initiatives in fiscal year 2011 and achieving $60 million in savings, but most selected agencies' efforts did not address their highest spending areas, such as services.

2. RCRA's regulations apply to all hazardous waste, regardless of where or how it is generated, including waste from cleanups. Waste associated with cleanups, often referred to as remediation waste, must be managed under RCRA's stringent requirements.
3. Several legislative proposals and administrative efforts have been made since 1995 to amend the application of RCRA's requirements to remediation waste. However, no comprehensive reform has been achieved due to disagreements on legal and technical issues.
4. Three of RCRA's hazardous waste management requirements—land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits—may be unduly stringent for a significant portion of remediation waste that poses a lesser risk to human health and the environment.
5. EPA has provided alternative policies to mitigate the impact of these requirements on cleanups, but their applicability and legality have been a source of confusion and controversy.

1. The Department of Defense (DOD) identified $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments in a prior report. DOD has reversed $592 million of these adjustments, but additional accounting problems have been discovered that require detailed reviews to determine the correct accounting actions.
2. DOD's long-standing accounting accuracy problems have resulted in reversing transactions that brought to light additional accounting problems. For the remaining $23 million of adjustments, DOD provided additional documentation indicating that $8 million were proper and do not need to be reversed. However, $15 million are still considered unnecessary or unsupported adjustments.
3. Of the 45 contracts involved in the $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper adjustments, 30 had additional accounting errors that must be corrected. These contracts include over $457 million (77 percent) of the reversed transactions.
4. DFAS Columbus estimates that it will take over 21,000 hours to correct the accounting for the 30 contracts. For example, one contract had $210 million of closed account adjustments that should not have been made because the initial disbursement was recorded against the correct ACRN on the contract.
5. DOD plans to complete all 30 reaudits to correct the fiscal year 2000 illegal and otherwise improper adjustments by September 30, 2002. In addition, the Air Force is investigating personnel responsible for monitoring and administering the contract to determine if they acted improperly and if Antideficiency Act violations occurred.
6. DOD's inability to accurately account for and report on disbursements overall is a long-term, major problem. For example, almost $1 of every $3 in contract payment transactions was for adjustments to previously recorded payments in fiscal year 1999. Simplified contract accounting is a key element to reform DOD's financial management.

Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure aimed at eliminating or restructuring debts, and it operates as an automatic stay that halts most collection activities against the debtor.
2. The bankruptcy process involves several stages, including first-day motions, disclosure, plan of reorganization, and reorganization itself. Business debtors may seek liquidation or reorganization, and proceedings can be voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary proceedings allow the debtor to defend against the request.

Both programs use the same definition of disability for initial entitlement, requiring a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that has lasted or is expected to last at least one year or result in death and prevents substantial gainful activity.
2. DI, established in 1956, is an insurance program that helps replace earnings lost due to disability. Eligibility requires a specified number of work credits based on age at onset of disability, and benefits are financed by payroll taxes. Most beneficiaries qualify for Medicare after 24 months of entitlement.
3. SSI, established in 1972, provides a minimum income for individuals with disabilities and limited income and assets. Eligibility does not require a work history, and benefits are paid from general revenues. Most beneficiaries qualify for Medicaid. Concurrent beneficiaries may receive both benefits, and work incentive provisions exist in both programs to encourage beneficiaries to return to work.
4. Challenges in serving concurrent beneficiaries include the lack of integrated guidance for processing work information, untimely actions when DI beneficiaries work, and the complexity of public information materials. SSA is taking steps to address these challenges, including the development of a new computer system and the employment support representative position.

Among these, 8% were hard frozen, meaning all current employees receive no additional benefit accruals, and 20% were under a soft freeze, partial freeze, or ""other"" freeze.
6. The survey also found that health benefits were the largest nonwage compensation cost, representing 15% of base pay, and that most respondents offered retiree health benefits to some current and future retirees, although 46% no longer offered these benefits to active employees hired after a certain date.

1. Refugees are individuals who are unable or unwilling to return to their country due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The Refugee Act of 1980 established a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the United States.
2. The refugee resettlement process involves several federal, state, and local government agencies and private organizations. The President determines the maximum number of refugees to be admitted each year, and refugees are assigned to communities based on their capacity to serve them.
3. Refugees receive various services during their initial resettlement period, including housing, food, clothing, and employment assistance. They may also be eligible for temporary cash and medical assistance from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).
4. Communities that have effectively consulted with stakeholders before resettling refugees have been able to better serve their needs and avoid reaching a crisis point. ORR and PRM could disseminate best practices related to refugee placement decisions and increase the responsiveness of grants designed for secondary migrants.
5. Refugees can have a significant impact on their communities, particularly in cases where relevant stakeholders are not consulted before their arrival. Effective strategies for consultation would benefit both refugees and their communities and promote integration.

1. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 established the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to provide government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, reducing federal government costs for repairing flood damage.
2. Since then, several pieces of legislation have strengthened NFIP, including making flood insurance mandatory for properties in vulnerable areas with mortgages from federally regulated lenders, and offering grant programs for repetitive loss properties.
3. NFIP offers subsidized and full-risk premiums, with subsidized rates applying to about 22 percent of all policies. However, these subsidized rates do not fully reflect the actual risk of loss, leading to potential taxpayer costs.
4. To address this issue, increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss, including catastrophic losses, would result in premiums that more closely approximate private insurer rates, decreasing taxpayer costs and encouraging private market participation.
5. Mitigation efforts, such as elevation, relocation, and demolition, can reduce the risk of flood damage and put NFIP on a firmer financial footing. FEMA has made efforts to address repetitive loss properties through mitigation, but the number of such properties has continued to grow.
6. To limit costs to taxpayers, NFIP needs to generate enough in premiums to pay claims, even in years with catastrophic losses. This goal is closely tied to eliminating subsidies and other reduced rates, and increasing mitigation efforts can further reduce flood damage and taxpayer costs.

2. These agreements allow state and local officers to have direct access to ICE databases and act in the stead of ICE agents by processing aliens for removal. They can initiate removal proceedings and transport aliens to ICE-approved detention facilities.
3. The statute requires a written agreement, background checks for officers, knowledge of federal law, training, supervision by ICE, and specific powers and duties to be set forth in the agreement.
4. ICE's Office of State and Local Coordination (OSLC) is responsible for the 287(g) program and offers state and local law enforcement agencies the opportunity to participate in various assistance programs, including the 287(g) program.
5. The 287(g) program has grown rapidly and received funding from DHS appropriations acts since 2006. Participating agencies may apply for financial assistance to cover some costs associated with the program.
6. The lack of management controls in the 287(g) program includes the absence of documented program objectives, inconsistent use of 287(g) authority, and insufficient supervision and communication from ICE.
7. ICE has begun to address these issues by conducting compliance inspections and developing performance measures for the program.
8. The 287(g) program aims to enhance community safety by addressing serious criminal activity by removable aliens, but the lack of internal controls could limit its effectiveness and potentially burden ICE with minor cases.

1. By the late 1970s, First City Bancorporation of Texas had a high concentration of loans to the energy industry and was regarded as a principal lender in that industry. In the early and mid-1980s, when the energy industry experienced financial difficulties, so did First City. By 1986, First City was reporting operating losses.
2. In 1988, FDIC provided $970 million in open bank assistance to First City, which included a capital infusion and the creation of a collecting bank to dispose of certain troubled assets. The agreement also required First City to reduce its subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20.
3. Between 1988 and 1990, First City reported profits and paid cash dividends, but these profits depended on nontraditional and onetime sources of income. During this period, First City's loan portfolios included high-risk loans, such as loans to finance highly leveraged transactions, international loans, and out-of-territory lending.
4. By September 1990, problems with the quality of its loan portfolios caused operating losses and eroded First City's capital. OCC and FDIC considered various resolution plans, including a Type A transaction (acquisition by a stronger institution), a Type B transaction (major capital infusion by an outside investor), and a Type C transaction (self-rescue by the banking organization).
5. In 1991 and 1992, First City pursued a Type A transaction, but FDIC rejected the proposal due to its estimated cost to FDIC and the difficulty of negotiations with the acquirer. First City then submitted two self-rescue proposals, but neither was accepted due to insufficient incoming capital and concerns about the ability of First City management to execute the plans.
6. In October 1992, OCC determined that First City-Houston was insolvent and closed it, along with First City-Dallas. FDIC estimated the sale of the remaining 18 banks would result in a gain of about $60 million, but the holding company filed lawsuits alleging that the regulators acted without due process and illegally closed a solvent banking organization.

2. The selection process for intermediaries and carriers differs from most federal programs. Intermediaries are chosen through a nomination process by provider associations, while carriers are chosen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services from a small pool of health insurers.
3. Medicare could benefit from contracting reforms, including allowing the program to directly choose contractors on a competitive basis, allowing functional contracting, and authorizing performance-based contracts.
4. Using only health insurers for claims administration may no longer be necessary due to advancements in information technology and the decline in the number of contractors.
5. Challenges of functional contracting include preparing clear statements of work and contractor selection criteria, efficiently integrating new contractors into Medicare’s claims processing operations, and developing sound evaluation criteria for assessing performance.

2. The Defense Science Board (DSB) issued two reports in 1996 addressing outsourcing and other opportunities for reducing DOD support services. The first report focused solely on outsourcing, and the second report had a broader scope that included other methods for reducing infrastructure costs.
3. The DSB estimated that DOD could save between $7 billion and $12 billion annually by fiscal year 2002 through outsourcing support functions, primarily from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities. These savings would represent a 40-percent reduction in the estimated $14 billion spent annually on CONUS logistics activities.
4. However, the Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) directorate assessed the DSB's savings estimates and found that they were overstated by about $1 billion due to understated contract administration and oversight costs and one-time inventory savings claimed as steady state savings. Additionally, about $1 billion of the projected savings was difficult to achieve due to legal and cultural impediments, and another $2 billion was unlikely to be saved due to timing and DOD's culture.

5. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized the establishment of franchise fund pilot programs to provide common administrative services more efficiently than federal agencies.
6. GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures, did not ensure fair and reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings for DOD customers.
7. The franchise funds' business model involves a two-step process of placing orders under previously awarded contracts and subsequently defining requirements for that order.
8. The franchise funds need to develop clear, consistent, and enforceable policies and processes that comply with contracting regulations while maintaining good customer service.

1. The Foundation, a private nonprofit organization, was incorporated in 1985 and is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Its purpose is to honor America’s World War II veterans and teach future generations about World War II.
2. In 1992, the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act was passed, directing the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to mint and issue commemorative World War II coins and transfer surcharges to the Foundation for creating a U.S. D-Day and Battle of Normandy Memorial in Normandy.
3. The Foundation received $3 million from the Treasury in 1993 and used the funds, along with interest earned, to build the Memorial Garden in Caen, France, adjacent to a World War II museum. The Memorial Garden was dedicated in 1994.
4. In 1993, allegations of financial impropriety were made against the Foundation and its then president, Anthony C. Stout. A special committee was appointed to investigate the allegations, and it concluded that the Foundation had met its stated corporate goals and that accusations against Mr. Stout were unsupported.
5. The Foundation has experienced significant financial problems, including weak internal controls over transactions between the Foundation and Mr. Stout, a lack of formal written policies and procedures for travel and expense reimbursements, and a precarious financial condition that casts doubt on its ability to continue operations.
6. The Foundation has received criticism for spending a significant portion of its revenues on activities not directly related to its stated program activities and for promoting tours to Normandy in 1993. The Foundation denies any wrongdoing and states that it has spent approximately 63% of its revenues on program activities since 1986 and that its tour promotion activities were in accordance with the Coins Act.
7. The Foundation's liabilities continue to exceed its assets, and it is uncertain whether it will be able to fund future costs of operating and maintaining the Memorial Garden or other projects, such as the Wall of Liberty.

1. Pension plans invest in hedge funds and private equity to achieve various goals, including reducing volatility, obtaining higher returns, and diversifying the portfolio. However, these investments pose challenges, such as high fees, limited transparency, and operational risks.
2. Hedge funds are actively managed investments that can generate large returns but also involve higher fees, leverage, and limited transparency. Pension plans mitigate these challenges by investing through funds of funds, which provide diversification and rely on the fund of funds manager to conduct due diligence and monitoring.
3. Private equity funds invest in companies with the goal of obtaining long-term appreciation through financial restructuring, improved operating processes, and mergers or acquisitions. These investments require longer-term commitments and involve higher fees, concentration risk, and wide variation in performance.
4. Public and private sector pension plans invest in hedge funds and private equity, with allocations ranging from less than 1% to over 20% of total plan assets. ERISA and state laws require pension plans to follow prudent investment standards, but there is no specific prohibition on investing in hedge funds or private equity.
5. State approaches to regulating pension plan investments in hedge funds and private equity vary, with some states imposing restrictions or requiring approval for these investments. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation does not insure benefits for private sector plans investing in these assets, but public sector plans may call upon state or local taxpayers to overcome funding shortfalls.

The territories of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have some discretion in setting Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards and provider payment rates, but they face significant funding differences compared to states. Territories have lower federal matching rates for Medicaid and CHIP, and their funding is subject to statutory caps. These funding differences have contributed to lower federal and territory Medicaid program expenditures in the territories.
2. Territories have varying methods for determining Medicaid eligibility and coverage of benefits. Puerto Rico is the only territory that uses its CHIP funds to cover additional children in its Medicaid programs, while Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands base eligibility on local poverty levels that are more restrictive than federal standards. American Samoa does not determine eligibility on an individual basis, but instead presumes that all individuals with incomes at or below 200 percent of the FPL are eligible.

2. The report is concerned with both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles). The report also considers prospects for improving the safety of automobile occupants.
3. The text notes that traffic fatalities and the fatality rate per registered vehicle have decreased significantly in the United States since the mid-1960s. However, nearly 29,000 traffic deaths were associated with automobiles in 1991, including about 10,000 killed in single-car collisions, 12,000 in multiple-vehicle collisions, and 4,000 pedestrians or cyclists hit by automobiles.
4. The text explains that different models of automobiles make different contributions to the fatality toll, with some models having much higher occupant fatality rates than others. Some automobile characteristics associated with higher fatality rates include sports cars and small cars. However, the relationship between automobile type and fatality rate is complex, as different types of drivers prefer particular types of automobiles, affecting both the number of collisions involving particular autos and the probability of serious injury in the event of a collision.

3. Fees can be voluntary or mandatory, and the legal distinction between a fee and a tax is not always clear. Agencies derive their authority to charge fees from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) or specific statutory authority.
4. User fees should be fair and based on costs, value, public policy, and other relevant factors. Collections are deposited in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and are generally not available to the agency or activity generating the fees.
5. User fees can promote equity by following the beneficiary-pays principle, which assigns costs based on who primarily benefits from the program. Fees can also be passed along to others through price changes, affecting the incidence of the fee and the perceived equity.
6. Fees can be collected at the point of sale, service, or after the service has been provided. Collecting the fee at the point of sale or service can decrease administrative costs, but internal controls for fee collections are still necessary.

3. When a federal action cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species, and the federal agency believes that RPAs would thwart the project, the federal agency, governor, or licensees/permittees may seek an exemption.

5. There have been only two instances where an exemption was granted, and the process is rarely used due to its complexity, the need for the applicant to fund permanent mitigation, and the fact that after an exemption is granted, the burden of conservation may fall more heavily on other areas that the species inhabits or on other resources that the species requires.

1. The ""state sponsors of terrorism list"" is a list mandated under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, which identifies countries that have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
2. Cuba has been on the list since 1982, and at present, there are four other countries on the list—Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
3. Being listed as a sponsor of international terrorism restricts bilateral assistance in annual foreign assistance appropriations acts, denies trade benefits, and limits support in international financial institutions.
4. Cuba's retention on the terrorism list has received more attention in recent years due to legislative initiatives to lift some U.S. economic sanctions under the current embargo.
5. The President can rescind a country's retention on the terrorism list by submitting a report to Congress certifying that the government has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period and will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.
6. Cuba was added to the terrorism list in 1982 due to its support for armed insurgencies and terrorist activities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Reagan Administration alleged that Cuba provided support for terrorist organizations, including the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia, and transshipped Soviet arms to Nicaragua and El Salvador for use by terrorist organizations.

1. The AMT is an alternative tax calculation with a broader tax base that requires individuals to add back certain provisions and deductions, including state and local taxes, medical expenses, miscellaneous deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions.
2. The first $175,000 is taxed at 26%, and the remainder is taxed at 28%. Exemptions are phased out.
3. The AMT base does not include benefits of lower capital gains tax rates, exclusion for tax-exempt bonds, and the itemized deduction for home mortgage interest.
4. The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has increased significantly due to inflation and the failure to index exemptions for inflation.
5. In 1987, about 140,000 returns paid the AMT, but by 1999, this number had increased to 823,000, and it is projected to reach over 9 million by 2009.
6. The AMT will gradually reach further down into the income distribution, although it will still be concentrated among higher income individuals.
7. The cost of correcting the AMT is significant, with indexing AMT exemptions costing $13.9 billion by 2008 and eliminating the credit limit provision costing many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009.
8. Proposed tax cuts that reduce regular tax liabilities but do not alter the AMT will interact with the AMT in two ways: they will increase the number of taxpayers on the AMT and the number affected by the credit limit, and they will cause some or all of the tax cut not to be received by certain families.

3. Some in the U.S. are concerned that India's friendship with Iran could become an obstacle to further development of U.S.-India ties, but the relationship is not a strategic alliance and is unlikely to derail the U.S.-India partnership.
4. India's relations with Iran are underpinned by historical, civilizational, and multifaceted ties, and have acquired a strategic dimension in the areas of energy, trade and commerce, information technology, and transit.
5. India has expressed its opposition to the development of new nuclear weapons powers in the region and has aligned itself with international efforts to bring Iran's controversial nuclear program into conformity with Non-Proliferation Treaty and IAEA provisions.
6. There are concerns in the U.S. about India's defense relations with Iran and its plans to seek energy resources from Iran, which could benefit a country the U.S. seeks to isolate. Indian firms have taken long-term contracts for purchase of Iranian gas and oil, and India supports the proposed construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas to India through Pakistan.
7. India has faced pressure from the U.S. to vote against Iran in international forums, with the U.S. ambassador to India linking progress on proposed U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation with India's upcoming IAEA vote. India has rejected such linkages and has maintained a careful balance between its relations with the U.S. and Iran.

1. In 2009, there was renewed interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs) due to low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes. Advocates argue that stricter import controls would prevent unlimited importation of milk protein, encourage domestic production, and raise milk prices for farmers. Opponents contend that such measures would increase costs for food manufacturers and result in higher retail food prices.
2. The United States imports a significant amount of dairy products, with cheese being the largest share and MPCs and casein/caseinates representing 35% of total import value. The U.S. produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates, and some economists suggest that federal dairy policies have encouraged the production of nonfat dry milk at the expense of milk protein concentrate or casein.
3. Import restrictions on MPCs have been proposed through legislation such as the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act. These proposed restrictions would establish tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) and impose duties on imports exceeding the quotas. The United States might need to enter into compensation negotiations with WTO member countries that are major suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market if the legislation is enacted.

3. Florida v. Harris addressed whether an alert by a trained drug-detection dog is sufficient to establish probable cause for a search of a vehicle.
4. Bailey v. United States concerned the question of whether the detention of an individual who has just left premises to be searched under warrant is permissible when the individual is detained out of view of the house as soon as possible.
5. Missouri v. McNeely addressed whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases.
6. In Florida v. Jardines, Miami-Dade Police received an unverified tip that Jardines was growing marijuana in his house and used a trained drug-sniffing dog to detect the presence of drugs at the front door.
7. The Florida Supreme Court held that the use of a drug-sniffing dog on Jardines's front porch constituted a search and that such a search required probable cause before it could be conducted.
8. In Florida v. Harris, the Court refused to accept a trained dog's positive reaction as per se probable cause to search a vehicle.

1. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 phased out the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, leaving the gift tax as the only federal transfer tax in 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 temporarily reinstated these taxes with lower top rates and larger exemptions. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently extended the estate tax rules, except for the top tax rate which increased from 35% to 40%.
2. The federal estate and gift taxes are unified, utilizing the same rate structure and sharing a lifetime transfer credit. For 2014, the unified credit covers an applicable amount of $5,340,000 per individual.
3. The gross estate of a decedent includes the value of all property owned by the decedent on the date of death, as well as certain interests in property transferred prior to death under specific conditions. Proceeds from a life insurance policy or a survivor's annuity may also be included.
4. The taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate with allowable deductions, including estate administration expenses, certain debts and losses, the amount of qualified transfers to a surviving spouse, charitable bequests, and state death taxes.
5. The federal gift tax is a tax imposed on annual gratuitous transfers of property made during life, with the donor's tax liability based on the value of the taxable gift. The taxable gift is determined by reducing the gross value of the gift by available deductions and exclusions.
6. The generation-skipping transfer tax is a flat-rate tax applied to three different transfer events: a direct skip, a taxable termination, or a taxable distribution. The tax rate is set at the highest estate tax rate (currently 40%), and the taxable amount is determined based on the value of the property transferred and the inclusion ratio.

1. Congress has used commemoratives to express gratitude, dramatize virtues, and perpetuate remembrance since its inception. The first commemoratives were in the form of individually struck medals, but Congress gradually broadened the scope to include special days for national observance, monuments and memorials, federal holidays, and legislative commemorations.
2. Commemorative options available to Congress can be divided into legislative and nonlegislative actions. Legislative options include naming federal buildings, creating postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, authorizing monuments and memorials, establishing commemorative commissions, and creating federal holidays. Nonlegislative options include sending certificates of recognition, making floor speeches, and sending flags flown over the Capitol Building to constituents.
3. Several initiatives were undertaken in the 1960s to reduce the number of commemoratives proposed through legislation due to concerns about excessive legislative time spent on such measures. These initiatives included creating an advisory commission and amending congressional rules on the introduction and consideration of commemorative legislation.
4. House Rule XII, clause 5, prohibits the introduction or consideration of any bill, resolution, or amendment that establishes or expresses a commemoration. The rule defines a commemoration as any remembrance, celebration, or recognition for any purpose through the designation of a specified period of time.
5. Commemorative options include naming federal buildings, designing postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, creating monuments and memorials, and requesting presidential proclamations. Nonlegislative options include creating individual office awards, giving floor speeches, sending official letters, and ordering flags.
6. The process for creating monuments and memorials outside the District of Columbia is determined based on whether the work will be placed on existing federal land. Congress has handled the creation of monuments and memorials outside the District of Columbia in two ways: by directly authorizing a new commemorative or by making an existing commemorative a ""national"" monument or memorial.

2. COMPETES 2010 increased funding authorizations for the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, and established new programs such as inducement prizes, a loan guarantee program, and the Regional Innovation Program (RIP).
3. In FY2013, the President requested increased funding for the doubling path accounts at NIST but did not seek funding for many COMPETES 2010-authorized STEM education programs or new programs without defined funding authorizations.
4. The President's FY2013 budget request for NSF's Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account was $5.983 billion, which was $654.5 million (9.9%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized amount. The request included funding for a new Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering and Materials (SusCHEM) program.
5. The NSF's FY2013 budget request also proposed $67.0 million in research program terminations, including reductions in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and public outreach.
6. The FY2013 funding status of COMPETES 2010 provisions was influenced by sequestration and rescissions, resulting in funding levels that were generally below FY2010 actual levels for the targeted accounts.

2. The 2008 amendments expanded the definition of a plant to include any wild member of the plant kingdom, and required importers to submit an import declaration containing certain information about the plant or plant product and its country of origin.
3. The primary aims of the 2008 amendments were to reduce illegal logging and increase the value of U.S. wood exports. Illegal logging is a pervasive problem affecting several countries and costs governments approximately $5 billion annually in lost royalties and an additional $10 billion in lost revenue.
4. The implementation of the declaration requirements under the 2008 amendments has been controversial, with some questioning why U.S. importers should be held responsible for violations of foreign law potentially committed by foreign entities, and others finding the declaration requirements cumbersome and difficult to meet.

2. The AMRs using sulfone-substituted anhydrides yielded sulfone lactams as single isomers in high yields. The stereochemical outcome of the reactions was explained by a transition state analogous to what is operative for cyanosuccinic anhydrides.
3. The carboxylic acid intermediates were prone to decarboxylation, and the resulting sulfone lactams showed a change in diastereoselectivity upon decarboxylation, suggesting the formation of a planar anion followed by selective protonation from one face of the anion.
4. The AMRs tolerated a variety of non-enolizable aldehydes and a variety of alkylamines and anilines. The use of commercially available imines or those purified by distillation significantly increased the yields of the lactam products.

1. The text discusses the role of microRNAs (mir-125a, mir-206, mir-145, mir-21, and mir-10b) in the invasion and development of breast cancer. Mir-125a, mir-206, and mir-145 are similar to tumor suppressor genes and may be involved in the suppression of breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Mir-10b expression may indicate the invasion and development of breast cancer. Mir-21 is related to old patients with lymph node metastasis and positive her-2 expression, and is an independent prognostic factor of breast cancer.
2. The text also mentions the relationship between specific mirnas and hormone receptor expression in breast cancer. Her-2-positive breast cancer is highly malignant and can reappear and transfer easily, and mir-125a can inhibit the expression of oncogenes her-2 and her-3. Mir-145 and mir-206 are related to negative er and negative her-2, and mir-145 is highly expressed in negative pr, whereas mir-206 is negatively correlated with negative pr. Mir-21 is positively related to top 2a, whereas mir-125a and mir-145 are negatively associated with top 2a. These findings suggest that mir-145 and mir-125a might inhibit the top 2a gene and are connected with anthracycline drug resistance.

The study found that mononuclear leukocytes accumulating in allograft blood vessels on day 9 after transplantation express elevated levels of tgm2 mRNA and protein. After resolution of acute rejection on day 42, tgm2 mRNA levels are lower but still moderately increased compared to isografts, while protein levels remain unchanged.
2. The study also found that active caspase-3, a key protease involved in apoptosis, is expressed by intravascular graft leukocytes during reversible acute rejection. The results suggest that tgm2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of CAI, potentially by contributing to vascular remodeling or protecting graft blood vessels. However, the study did not find a protective effect of cystamine, a general inhibitor of tgm, on arterial remodeling or intimal hyperplasia in the rat model.

3. MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) is the gold standard for root-end filling materials due to its excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, antimicrobial effects, and resistance to fluid and blood contamination.
4. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus against C. albicans at 1-, 24-, and 48-hour time points.
5. Both MTA and MTA-Angelus were incapable of killing C. albicans after 1 hour, but they were fungicidal at 24 hours for both fresh and set samples and at both concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml.
6. There was no significant difference in the antifungal properties of proroot MTA and MTA-Angelus at either concentration or either time point.
7. The tube-dilution susceptibility test was used in this study to allow direct contact between C. albicans and the experimental materials, providing a more realistic interaction.
8. MTA-Angelus has an effective antifungal property comparable to proroot MTA at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/ml.
9. The presence of calcium hydroxide, produced by the hydration reaction from the mixing of MTA with water, and an increase in pH due to the release of hydroxyl ions, is probably the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of MTA-Angelus.

2. The costs associated with RA are significant and include both direct medical costs and indirect costs such as productivity loss and informal care. The introduction of biological agents has led to increased direct medical costs but also improvements in disease activity and joint damage.
3. The economic burden of RA is expected to increase in Italy due to the aging population and the increasing prevalence of the disease. The use of cost-effective treatments and the management of comorbidities are important strategies for reducing the economic burden.
4. Comorbidities are common in RA patients and can significantly impact the economic burden of the disease. Depression, hepatitis B and C, and a high number of skin nevi are among the most prevalent comorbidities in Italy. Successful treatment of RA can lead to important gains in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which can help reduce the economic burden associated with comorbidities.

A 71-year-old male patient with oral submucous fibrosis and limited mouth opening of 2.5 cm was treated with sectional maxillary and mandibular final impression procedures, followed by fabricating maxillary hinged and mandibular sectional and hinged complete dentures. The patient underwent impression taking using smallest size stock trays, border molding, and final impression making with light body polyvinyl siloxane addition silicon impression material. Hinge assemblies were incorporated between the two sections of the dentures using self-cure acrylic resin.
2. Different techniques for fabricating sectional and hinged dentures for patients with microstomia are documented in the literature. In cases where microstomia is not manageable by surgeries or dynamic opening devices, modified impression procedures and prosthesis designs facilitate prosthetic rehabilitation. The use of sectional impression techniques and/or sectional dentures can help overcome clinical difficulties.
3. Simplified sectional tray design and ease of fabrication are the major advantages of this technique. This technique can be accomplished in any dental laboratory without using complicated machinery or attachment devices for sectioning or assembling the trays/prosthesis together. The press buttons and mandibular molar bands are easily available and easy to maintain. However, this technique shares disadvantages common to all sectional tray/prosthesis designs, such as additional time, labor, and materials. Periodic recall, maintenance, and further improvements in design are needed to determine the long-term success of this technique.

1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with high mortality, disproportionately affecting developing countries and males. Risk factors include chronic liver inflammation from hepatitis B and C, excessive alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, environmental carcinogens, and genetic metabolic diseases. Prognostic and therapeutic options depend on the severity of underlying liver disease, with median overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced disease estimated at 58 months. HCC is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug-resistant genes, protein products, and p53 mutations.
2. The molecular pathogenesis of HCC is multifactorial and reliant upon dysregulation of multiple pathways, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, c-Met. HGF promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. HGF-cMet signaling is critical for normal processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, and postnatal tissue repair after acute injury. Dysregulated HGF-cMet signaling is implicated in cellular invasion and metastases through induction of increased proliferation, migration and mobility, three-dimensional epithelial cell organization, and angiogenesis.

3. Recent studies have confirmed that type 2 diabetes increases the risk for certain types of malignancies, including breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors.
4. Long-acting insulin analogues, such as glargine, are commonly used in the management of type 2 diabetes, and some studies suggest that glargine may promote cancer growth through the IGF-1 pathway.
5. A German epidemiologic study suggested a specific cancer risk associated with glargine, but the findings were controversial and three additional studies were commissioned to confirm or refute the findings.
6. The studies had various limitations, including the lack of prospective treatment allocation, insufficient insulin dose data, and the exclusion of patients on combination insulin therapy.

4. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a popular material for AR layers due to its wide bandgap and use in photocatalysis and optoelectronic nanodevices.
5. ZnO nanorod arrays have been shown to exhibit better AR properties than other oxide compounds, with a weighted global reflectance of 6.6% in the broadband range from 400 to 1,200 nm.
6. ZnO nanowhiskers (NWS) have been grown on the surface of Czochralski (Cz) silicon solar cells using a seeding and growth two-step process, improving the efficiency by 3%.
7. The fabrication of ZnO NWS involves nucleation and growth in aqueous solutions, with the main chemical reactions being the decomposition of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine.
8. The growth of ZnO NWS is influenced by the ph value of the solution, which should be 6 or 7 for the reaction to occur.
9. The length and density of ZnO NWS can be controlled by the growth time, with tapered NWS obtained after 30 minutes and longer NWS obtained with increasing growth time.

3. Molecular imaging techniques using PET or SPECT have been used to improve diagnostic accuracy in PD and non-PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and sympathetic innervation of the heart have become popular tools in clinical practice.
4. DAT SPECT imaging using [I]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)-n-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) can visualize presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract and help exclude patients with essential tremor, psychogenic, and vascular parkinsonism.
5. MIBG myocardial scintigraphy assesses sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals and can distinguish PD from other parkinsonian syndromes based on decreased cardiac MIBG uptake in PD patients.
6. However, neither DAT SPECT nor MIBG scintigraphy can differentiate between various types of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes with sufficient accuracy when used alone.

1. The text describes a case of a 73-year-old Korean man who presented with a perianal nodule caused by the tick species Amblyomma testudinarium.
2. The patient had recalled defecating near a water reservoir in a rural area of South Korea and feeling a sting around the anus, which was later identified as the site of tick attachment.
3. The tick was identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on its morphological characteristics, including a small ornate scutum, long pedipalps, and a long spur on the coxa iv.
4. Histopathological examination of the tick bite site revealed an intense skin reaction, a feeding lesion with a perirostral and deep cavitary portion, and a paucicellular zone with few inflammatory cells.
5. A. testudinarium is a large ornate tick that is distributed in Korea and other tropical areas, including South East Asia and the Indian Peninsula. It is more common in the southern coastal areas of these regions.
6. Ticks embed their anterior part, called the capitulum, into the skin to feed, and the histopathology of skin responses to A. testudinarium infection shows a dermal infiltration of various inflammatory cells associated with both acute and chronic reactions, as well as a paucicellular zone with few inflammatory cells.

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, predominantly involving the interventricular septum, in the absence of other causes.
2. Familial HCM is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, with at least 15 genes implicated and major genes including cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH7), troponin T (TNNT2), cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and cardiac troponin I (TNNI3).
3. Mutations in the TNNT2 gene, which encodes cardiac troponin T, have been reported in approximately 15% of familial HCM cases, with most missense mutations located in exons 8-16 and associated with a severe form of the disease.
4. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been identified as a predictive marker of ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM.
5. Genetic analysis and determination of genotype-phenotype correlation are important in risk stratification for HCM, but clinical parameters such as degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, presence or absence of a left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and electrophysiology testing have not been predictive markers of poor prognosis.
6. In recent years, mutation-specific risk stratification has been considered clinically informative, and the TNNT2 mutation has the third-ranked incidence of familial HCM in Japan, but the genotype-phenotype correlation of this gene still remains insufficient.

1. The text discusses a study conducted to determine predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sclm). The medical records of all consecutive patients who underwent liver resections for colorectal liver metastases from 1992 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively.
2. The study found that operation time greater than 8 hours was the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sclm. Other factors such as lateral lymph node dissection, primary site of rectum, and amount of intraoperative blood loss were also correlated with anastomotic leakage.
3. The morbidity rate and frequency of anastomotic leakage were high with simultaneous resection for sclm, especially in patients with greater intraoperative blood loss or operation time greater than 8 hours. For patients with sclm, staged resections should be considered when simultaneous resection would involve excessive surgical stress.
4. The limitations of the study include its retrospective design and the relatively small number of patients studied. Future studies should compare the efficacy and safety of simultaneous resection and staged resections in sclm, considering the resection rate of patients who could undergo both primary and hepatic resections and the risk of some patients not being able to undergo a second resection after the first one.

1. Hydatid cyst disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus parasite. Canines are the final hosts, and they infect the soil, water, and vegetables with their eggs. Herbivores and humans are intermediate hosts, and humans are most commonly infected through contaminated water and vegetables or direct contact with infected dogs. The disease is common in many parts of the world, especially in areas with animal husbandry, and is globally distributed in countries such as Argentina, Peru, East Africa, Central Asia, China, and South America.
2. In Khorasan Razavi province, Iran, during 2011-2014, 357 hydatid cyst cases were diagnosed. The most common cities with the highest number of cases were Mashhad (51.8%), Ghouchan (7.8%), Neishabour (7.0%), and Fariman (4.8%). The most common demographic characteristics of patients were women (54.9%), rural residents (40.3%), housewives (45.8%), and Afghans (3.4%). The most common clinical symptom was abdominal pain (42.3%), and the most common diagnosis methods were radiology (42.3%) and CT scan (37.8%).
3. The highest proportion of hydatidosis infections was found in the age group of 21-40 years old (39.2%). Women were more commonly infected than men (54.9% vs. 45.1%), likely due to their greater involvement in agricultural and animal husbandry activities. The most common localization of hydatid cysts was the liver (59.4%). Previous studies have reported varying incidence rates and age groups with the highest proportion of infections, and conflicting results regarding the role of gender and occupation in infection risk.

1. A case report of a successful laparoscopic excision of a ciliated foregut cyst (CHFC) in a 32-year-old woman is presented. The cyst was found adhered to the liver by a small pedicle, leading to a complete excision instead of deroofing.
2. CHFCs are rare, congenital lesions that originate from evagination of the foregut during embryonogenesis. They are most commonly found in segment iv of the left lobe and are characterized by the presence of four layers: a pseudostratified columnar epithelium layer, a sub-epithelial connective tissue layer, a smooth muscle layer, and an outer fibrous capsule.
3. Laparoscopic excision of CHFCs is a viable option due to their superficial location, benign nature, and thick cyst wall. This minimally invasive approach allows for effective and ambulatory removal of the lesion, reducing morbidity and risk for malignant transformation.

The primary objective of the study was to examine the relationship between these two measures in primary OA knee patients.
2. The study was a cross-sectional survey of 251 patients with clinical and nonradiographic idiopathic knee OA, as diagnosed by knee pain and at least two of the following signs: stiffness, crepitus, bony tenderness, and bony enlargement. Exclusion criteria included current exercise or fitness walking, inability to read the questionnaire, inflammatory arthritis, current knee conditions, fractures, major surgical procedures, neurological conditions, or contraindications for exercise testing.
3. The results showed a weak correlation between the Koos questionnaire and the 6-mwt for functional limitation, but a strong correlation for pain, symptom, and sports subscales, and a very strong correlation for the quality of life subscale. Body mass index (BMI) had a strong correlation with all Koos subscales, and weight had a strong correlation with pain and quality of life. Age had a weak correlation with quality of life, but no correlation with pain or functional limitation.

1. Obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, and consumption of caloric foods. Adipose tissue secretes pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and the presence of large concentrations of endotoxins and saturated fatty acids in the diet promotes inflammation.
2. During menopause, the loss of estrogen production leads to adverse changes in lipoproteins, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The inflammatory processes following menopause result from a reduction in circulating levels of estrogens and their receptors, which have anti-inflammatory properties.
3. In this study, rats were fed a control or hyperlipidic diet for 4 weeks, and then ovariectomized or sham-operated. The results showed that a hyperlipidic diet caused a decrease in il-6 and il-10 levels in mes adipose tissues, while ovariectomy combined with a hyperlipidic diet decreased the tnf- content of mes adipose tissues.
4. Ovariectomy promotes increased adiposity, particularly in rats receiving a hyperlipidic diet, due to decreased uncoupling protein-1 (ucp-1) activity in brown adipose tissue and increased adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (lpl) activity.
5. The findings from this study suggest that a high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy may cause a decrease in energy expenditure and an increase in adipose tissue deposits, possibly via enhanced uptake of triglycerides (tg) from chylomicrons. Additionally, serum tg was lower in the sham h group compared with the sham c group.

1. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) can cause various clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to significant gastroduodenal disease. The diversity in clinical presentations is not well understood.
2. Both conditions, HP infection and CD, are associated with a local immune inflammatory reaction, characterized by an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the gastric mucosa.
3. The highest prevalence of lymphocytic gastritis (LG) is found in pediatric CD patients, followed by CD patients with HP infection. The contribution of HP infection to LG in an inflammatory condition like CD is not well established.
4. CD patients with associated HP infection showed a lower rate of LG compared to CD patients without HP infection. HP infection converts the immune response towards a Th2 response and suppresses the Th1 immune response.
5. The present study aimed to define the immunophenotype of the gastric mucosa of the two most prevalent etiologies of pediatric LG (CD and HP infection) and to clarify the interrelationship between HP and CD in the pediatric population.
6. The study found that CD patients had significantly higher numbers of CD8+ IELs compared to controls or HP infected patients without CD. Higher counts of CD8+ IELs may imply a diagnosis of CD rather than HP gastritis in undiagnosed patients.
7. The findings support the published data that CD8+/CD4 IELs are involved significantly in the pathogenesis of CD. The low expression of CD57 in the lymphoid cells indicates that NK cells may play a negligible role in these two pathologies.

3. The Revive survey, conducted in 2012, demonstrated that many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its associated symptoms.
4. Among women who reported vaginal symptoms, only approximately one-quarter identified menopause as the cause.
5. Almost half of the study population had never discussed their VVA symptoms with a healthcare provider (HCP), and among those who had, the HCP was the initiator only 13% of the time.
6. The most common reasons for not mentioning symptoms to HCPs were the assumption that symptoms were a natural part of aging or not bothersome enough at that time.
7. Among women who discussed VVA symptoms with an HCP, approximately half felt neutral or negative about the information and recommended treatment options they received.
8. The most commonly reported VVA symptoms were vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and local irritation, which had the greatest impact on enjoyment of sex for many women.

2. Oxidative stress, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a role in the development and progression of PAD. Risk factors for PAD, like high total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, are similar to those for coronary heart disease.
3. Statins, which lower lipid levels, also have pleiotropic effects, such as improving endothelial function, reducing oxidative stress, and affecting lipid metabolism enzyme activities. Statins are suggested for three reasons: preventing coronary heart disease, treating lower extremity PAD, and perioperative treatment of PAD patients.
4. The present study aimed to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of PAD patients before and after surgery, comparing them to a group on simvastatin therapy. The study found that PAD patients had higher total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels before surgery and enhanced oxidative stress, as indicated by elevated MDA levels. However, no significant decrease in LOOH and MDA concentrations was observed after surgery. The total antioxidant capacity (expressed as Frap) and thiol group concentrations were similar before surgery and on simvastatin therapy. However, a decrease in Frap level and thiol group concentrations was observed 35 days postoperatively and 710 days after surgery, which was lower than those in patients treated with simvastatin. An increase in ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was also observed in group i patients 710 days after surgery. All studied parameters in group i patients before surgery were significantly correlated with mean changes at 35 days and/or 710 days after surgery.

1. The text describes the use of a new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFTR-L) for the treatment of nonampullary superficial duodenal neoplasms. The procedure involves identifying the lesion using a forward-viewing endoscope, ligating it using a ligation device, temporarily suturing the seromuscular layer, resecting the lesion under the ligation band using a snare technique, and retrieving the specimen intraluminally. The procedure was completed without complications in five consecutive patients.
2. The advantages of LEFTR-L over conventional full-thickness resection include the avoidance of peritoneal exposure of tumor cells and the lack of requirement for proficient experience in endoscopic submucosal dissection. The resected specimen can be collected intraluminally, and the procedure does not increase the total operative time or endoscopic resection time significantly. Lesions smaller than 15 mm in diameter and not close to the ampulla of vater are potential candidates for this procedure.

3. Lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, can contribute to or help prevent cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Diet and physical activity can have positive effects for persons with preexisting coronary heart disease.
4. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between dietary and physical activity behaviors and SRH. It was hypothesized that participants who reported lower fruits and vegetables intake and higher fatty-food intake and perform less physical activity will have SRH poor/fair as compared to those in the good, very good, or excellent category, adjusting for covariates.
5. The study found that females were more likely than males to report poor/fair SRH, be obese, have comorbidities, consume fewer servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and have an intake of primary high-fat foods/mostly high-fat or some low-fat foods. Females who consumed 2 servings of fruits and vegetables per day were more likely to report poor/fair SRH than those who consumed 5 servings per day, both unadjusted and adjusted for confounding variables.

1. Endoscopic injection of Dextranomer / hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) has expanded as a treatment option for pediatric Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) with success rates improving over time.
2. Deflux, a Dx/HA compound, was FDA approved in 2001 for treating grade 2-4 VUR in children above one year old with no accompanying urological malformations.
3. The technique's ease, short procedure, and recovery time, as well as repeatability, have made it popular among surgeons and parents.
4. Reports suggest expanded use to patients of all ages and grades of VUR, even in the presence of duplication, ureterocele, or other lower tract anomalies.
5. The American Urological Association (AUA) considers endoscopic injection of Dx/HA an option in managing pediatric VUR.
6. Initial success rate was quoted as 68%, but success rates vary worldwide, with reported rates between 55-89%.
7. Pic cystography was developed to detect occult VUR in patients with recurrent UTIs after negative standard voiding cystograms.
8. Pic cystography has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystograms and can detect occult VUR. Parents can be advised to undergo Dx/HA injection during the same anesthesia if a positive pic cystogram is detected.
9. In the current study, two different pic cystography techniques and scenarios were evaluated: detecting de novo contralateral VUR in unilateral VUR cases and predicting successful surgical outcomes by correlating intraoperative and postoperative pic cystograms with standard 2-month postprocedure VCUGs.

1. The accuracy of detecting fetal pathology using ultrasound depends on the sonographer's expertise and limitations such as fetal head descent, skull bone ossification, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios.
2. Fetal MRI was first reported in 1989 and has become increasingly important in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies due to advances in technology and better understanding of fetal pathology.
3. Ventriculomegaly, a condition characterized by an enlarged lateral ventricle, has a prevalence of 0.3-1.5 and can be caused by an imbalance of cerebrospinal fluid, abnormal cerebral development, or destructive disease processes.
4. MRI has excellent contrast resolution and allows direct visualization of the cortical region without sonographic limiting factors. It is useful for detecting and characterizing additional cerebral anomalies, particularly in cases of moderate and severe ventriculomegaly.
5. The interobserver agreement for both ultrasound and MRI can vary greatly, and the level of subspecialty training of the individuals interpreting the MRI examination significantly improves agreement.
6. MRI is particularly useful for detecting small deposits of intraventricular blood, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cortical anomalies, and developmental anomalies such as vermis hypoplasia, Dandy Walker malformations, and Chiari malformations.

1. The text describes a study that aimed to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and skeletal-related events (SREs) on mortality among older lung cancer patients using a combined population-based cancer registry and Medicare claims database.
2. The study identified a cohort of patients aged 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of lung cancer between July 1, 1999, and December 31, 2005, and used Seer and Medicare data to determine possible occurrence of bone metastasis, SREs, and deaths through December 31, 2006. The study excluded patients without both Medicare Part A and Part B coverage or those enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan during the baseline period.
3. The study found that 19.8% of patients 65 years or older with newly diagnosed lung cancer presented with or subsequently had evidence of a possible bone metastasis as indicated by Medicare claims. Among these patients, 51% had one or more SREs. Having a bone metastasis was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer, and the lack of an additional effect of SREs on mortality among patients with bone metastasis may be due to the short survival time in lung cancer patients compared to other tumor types.

1. The text discusses the use of self-adhesive resin cements for fiber-reinforced posts and their superior bond strength compared to traditional cements.
2. Self-adhesive resin cements have an organic matrix made of phosphoric acid methacrylate and can adhere to dentin without the need for pre-treatment.
3. The smear layer on the dentin surface must be removed for proper bonding, but self-adhesive resin cements cannot completely remove it, which may result in lower bond strength.
4. Various methods for removing the smear layer include the use of sodium hypochlorite, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, orthophosphoric acid, and lasers.
5. A study was conducted to compare the effect of a photodynamic diode laser and other smear layer removal methods on the bond strength of self-adhesive cement using fiber posts.
6. The results of the study showed that the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups had the highest bond strength values.
7. The null hypothesis was rejected, as the study revealed that different smear layer removal methods affect the bond strength of a fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin (p<.05).

The human microbiome project in the USA and the metagenomics of the human intestinal tract (Metahit) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives.
2. The composition of the bacterial flora seems to depend on the environment and maternal input during delivery and upon breast feeding. Members of the same family have bacterial communities that are more similar to each other than to unrelated individuals, regardless of host genotype.
3. Recent studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities, including the identification of genes that are encoded by intestinal microbiota and their relevance within the context of gut function.
4. The human gut flora belongs mainly to two phyla: firmicutes and bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to proteobacteria and actinobacteria. Archaea, mostly represented by methanogenic methanobrevibacter smithii, have also been discovered.
5. The current concept of enterotypes, which are systematically organized clusters of microbes in each individual, has been given a boost by recent studies. Enterotypes are identified based on different clusters of bacterial species and have no geographical demarcation or correlation with sex, age, or body mass index.
6. The role of the individual's immune system, nutritional input during early childhood, lifestyle, and exposure to other gut microbial ecologies during the formative years of the microbiome may play a role in the establishment of the individual's enterotype.

1. The text describes an observational open clinical trial investigating the effect of topical tazarotene on distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis in 15 patients. The study reported complete mycological cure in 40% of patients after 4 weeks and complete healing in all patients after 12 weeks. Tazarotene also showed fungistatic activity against various fungi in vitro.
2. Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nail characterized by discoloration, thickening, and defect. Dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophytes are the involved pathogens, with dermatophytes being the most common agents. Risk factors for onychomycosis include aging, reduced peripheral circulation, and diabetes.
3. Successful topical treatment of onychomycosis is challenging due to slow nail growth, physical presence of the nail plate, and difficulty in finding compounds with adequate pharmacologic profile for nail penetration. Commonly used topical therapies include amorolfine 5% nail lacquer, ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, and tioconazole 28% solution, which require prolonged application and strong patient adherence. Newer topical antifungals like efinaconazole 10% and tavaborole 5% solutions have shown superior mycologic cure rates in phase III clinical trials.

1. The study aimed to improve existing cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) in clinical non-responders by testing acute haemodynamic responses to endocardial pacing at alternative sites.
2. Of the 24 non-consecutive patients who underwent the study, 11 had a positive response with an increase in left ventricular dp/dtmax (lvdp/dtmax) of 15% or more, and five of these patients agreed to permanent lv endocardial implantation, resulting in clinical improvement after six months of follow-up.
3. The study demonstrated limitations in using acute haemodynamic studies to predict clinical outcome, as five clinical non-responders showed a clear haemodynamic response but failed to clinically respond. However, one patient with a substantial increase in lvdp/dtmax from endocardial pacing at a posterolateral position compared with the apical coronary sinus lead did experience a positive clinical response.
4. The study also showed that the best haemodynamic response correlates well with the longest time interval between the onset of the qrs complex and intrinsic activation at the lv electrode in relation to the qrs width in the individual patient. Endocardial pacing opposite epicardial sites did not show acute haemodynamic improvement, so epicardial pacing at the optimal site may be a good alternative for endocardial lv lead placement.

2. The cost of milk production depends on the persistency of lactation, with high persistency associated with a slow rate of decline in milk production and low persistency with a rapid rate.
3. The data was collected from the National Dairy Research Institute in India for a period of 12 years, with 21 fortnightly test-day milk yield records considered per lactation.
4. The milk yield increased gradually to peak in the third and fourth fortnight in both normal and mastitis cows, but mastitis cows maintained peak milk yield only for this period.
5. The cows exhibited a steady decline in milk yield with advancement of lactation, with higher initial milk yield in normal cows and lower in mastitis cows in different parities.
6. The peak milk yield was observed in the fourth parity, while the minimum yield was in the first parity for both normal and mastitis cows.
7. The ascending slope parameter up to peak yield was similar in both groups in the first parity but declined in the second parity and increased in subsequent parities. The descending slope parameter was lower in the first parity and higher in the fourth parity for normal cows, but the reverse was true for mastitis cows.

2. The study utilized an unbalanced statistical design to minimize the number of mice per test group while maintaining statistical power. The group sizes were similar to those required for a weibull survival analysis with a 75% probability of detecting a 10% increase in mean lifespan with a 1% false positive rate.
3. The study found that 373mg/kg bw/d (3.5g/kg diet) of ndga extended median lifespan by 12%, but had no effect on maximum lifespan. The lowest dose of ndga also produced significant pathologies.
4. Necropsy results showed a highly significant increase in liver and lung tumors, enlarged thymuses, and hemorrhage into the peritoneum. Ndga decreased the size of liver tumors by 24%, suggesting it may decrease the rate of tumor growth, but increased the total tumor mass per mouse.
5. Clinical chemistries performed on mice treated with ndga for 9 weeks showed decreased alanine transaminase levels, but no significant changes in aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine, blood glucose, or other parameters.
6. The study also investigated the effects of ndga on drosophila lifespan and found that optimum oral treatment with 3.0mg/ml medium increased median lifespan by approximately 23%.
7. The study found no effect of ndga on food consumption, body weight, or locomotor activity in drosophila.
8. The study concluded that ndga can extend murine and drosophila lifespan, but its effects on energy uptake and utilization in flies were unlike those in mice. The doses of ndga that extend murine lifespan appear to overlap the dosages that produce serious pathologies.

3. Biomarkers are defined as characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to therapeutic interventions.
4. DNA biomarkers are stable and reproducible, and can be measured at any point in time, making them suitable for both prospective and retrospective studies. However, they cannot be used for therapy monitoring, pharmacodynamics, or as surrogate markers due to their stability.
5. DNA tumor biomarkers are specific to cancerous tumors and can show greater variation depending on how they are measured. They cannot serve as surrogate markers while general biomarkers often can.
6. Current applications of biomarkers include diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction in personalized medicine. For example, il28b gene is a strong indicator for response to standard treatment in patients with hepatitis c virus-1 infection, and mammaprint is a dna tumor biomarker for breast cancer prognosis.

1. Myosin VA (myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
2. Each myova dimer consists of a pair of n-terminal motor domains, lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a globular c-terminal cargo-binding domain.
3. Myova's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms, resulting in a processive motion of each head taking 72 nm steps in a hand-over-hand fashion.
4. Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of myova, but in the presence of high calcium (>1 m), motor processivity is reduced, and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm.
5. Calmodulin dissociation may render the lever arm highly compliant, reducing the efficiency of both the lever arm displacement amplification and the strain-dependent gating between the two heads, which are necessary for the motor's processivity.
6. Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains.
7. TPM involves anchoring a myova-actin complex to a microscope slide and attaching a visible particle (fluorescent quantum dot) to a desired location along the motor. Thermal energy causes the qdot to be randomly displaced, and the resulting motion is measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered qdot to a stationary reference qdot.
8. The flexural stiffness for the various myova constructs was determined by equipartition due to thermal energy, resulting in Brownian motion of the tethered qdot relative to the actin filament. The persistence length of the tether was calculated directly from the motion of the tethered qdot relative to actin and the length of the molecule.
9. The effective motions of the distal rod domain were isolated by using the procedure above with the motion of qdots bound to myova-hmm constructs rather than actin filaments as the baseline of comparison for myova-fl.

2. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients, and associations with disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
3. Univariate analysis showed no significant associations between the tested polymorphisms and DFS in patients with EAC or ESCC. However, multivariate analysis revealed that patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous mdm2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved DFS compared with patients carrying the wild-type genotype (adjusted hazard ratio (ahr) 0.63; 95% confidence interval (ci) [0.45-0.88]). Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous cdh1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type g/g genotype (ahr 4.0; 95% ci [1.4-11]).
4. The study suggests that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC. The mdm2 t/g and cdh1 ga/ga genotypes confer risk of death in patients with EAC.
5. The study highlights the potential of host genetic variability, specifically functional SNPs in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, to identify individuals with the best chance of survival from esophageal cancer.

Upregulation of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in AMD development and progression.
2. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, specifically ranibizumab and aflibercept, is the current standard of care for neovascular AMD, preventing vision loss and potentially improving visual acuity (VA). Ranibizumab and aflibercept have different binding affinities to VEGF, with aflibercept having a greater potency and longer duration of action.
3. The Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity (CS) test is a quick and reliable method for assessing visual function beyond high-contrast VA. CS measures an individual's ability to detect low contrast images and perceive differences between light and dark. CS is essential for evaluating visual performance in various conditions, including diabetic eye disease, macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and optic nerve disorders.
4. A study was conducted to evaluate the change in CS following a switch from ranibizumab to aflibercept in patients with recalcitrant exudative AMD. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in CS and a reduction in central retinal thickness (CRT) over 12 weeks, with no meaningful change in VA. The results support the use of CS as a valuable additional outcome end point in future clinical studies of neovascular AMD and other retinal diseases.

2. Researchers have investigated the role of interleukin-25 (IL-25) in MS, as it plays a key role in stimulating and development of T helper 2 (Th2) responses and is involved in the control function of endothelial cells, Th1, and Th17 cells. A polymorphism (c424c/a) within exon 2 of the IL-25 gene may be associated with immune system-related diseases.
3. In this study, the association between the c424c/a polymorphism within the IL-25 gene and MS in an Iranian population was evaluated. The study recruited 74 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 75 healthy controls and used logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of MS development in patients with the ac and aa genotypes compared to patients with the cc genotype.

The study also documented that the expression level of IL-25 decreased in MS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Although IL-25 may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as MS and IBD, the c424c/a polymorphism is not important in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

1. The text discusses a study using non-contrast CT to explore the prevalence of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAs and AAAs) in a Korean population with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).
2. The study included 542 Korean male hypertensive patients without a history of AAAs, and most suboptimal CT images were due to errors in raw data storage.
3. Maximal ascending and descending thoracic aorta diameters (ATAMax and DTAMax) and maximal abdominal aorta diameter (AAMax) were measured using non-contrast CT. TAAs were defined as ATAMax ≥ 40 mm, and AAAs as AAMax ≥ 30 mm.
4. Prevalence of TAAs was 36.5%, and 64.6% of patients with AAAs had TAAs. Prevalence of AAAs was 6.0%, and current/past smokers had a significantly higher risk of AAAs.
5. Determinants for TAAs included age, absence of dyslipidemia, body surface area, diastolic blood pressure, and presence of AAAs. Determinants for AAAs included presence of dyslipidemia, current/past smoking, and presence of TAAs.
6. The study highlights the need for further research to clarify the relationship between TAAs, AAAs, dyslipidemia, serum cholesterol, and statin therapy, and to establish screening strategies for TAAs and AAAs according to risk factors and ethnicity.

2. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in vasodilator substance output, particularly nitric oxide (NO), and an increase in endothelium-derived contracting factors.
3. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction in older individuals, reducing NO bioavailability and increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS).
4. Exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function in older individuals by boosting antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
5. Nrf2, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in the antioxidant defense system against oxidative stress and cytoplasmic expression levels of Ho-1, an inducible isoform of heme oxygenase, increase in response to exercise.

1. Axillary lymph node status is a crucial prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and the prognosis worsens with an increasing number of metastatic lymph nodes.
2. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/International Union Against Cancer (UICC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification categorizes nodal disease into three groups based on the number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes: n1 (1-12), n2 (13-49), and n3 (10 or more).
3. Studies suggest that the lymph node ratio (LNR), which is the ratio of the number of metastatic lymph nodes to the number of removed lymph nodes, provides more useful prognostic information compared to nodal disease classification based on the number of metastatic lymph nodes.
4. The LNR threshold value separating patients into two prognostic groups with significantly different survival varies depending on the study and patient population, with values ranging from 0.10 to 0.80.
5. In a retrospective study, the authors evaluated the prognostic significance of the number of removed and metastatic lymph nodes and LNR in breast carcinoma patients with 13 axillary metastatic lymph nodes.
6. The authors found that patients with 15 lymph nodes removed had significantly worse disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) compared to those with 6 or more lymph nodes removed. However, in multivariate cox analysis, only grouping based on the number of lymph nodes removed (grouping b) had independent prognostic value for DFS and LRFS.
7. LNR had independent prognostic significance for DFS, LRFS, and DMFS, and it can be used to separate n1 disease patients having at least 10 lymph nodes removed into low- and high-risk prognostic groups for distant metastasis development.

Phosphatases were found to be efficient catalysts for this reaction, with phonsf, phonse, and piacp being particularly effective. The use of inorganic oligophosphates as donors was found to be important for metal-containing phosphatases, but not for those using histidine as a catalytic residue.
2. The study also investigated the effect of reaction conditions, such as pH and phosphate donor type, on the phosphorylation of 1,4butanediol by phonsf. It was found that a high number of transferable high-energy phosphate moieties and low pH values were crucial for achieving and maintaining high product titers. Reactions were conducted at various pH values using high amounts of ppi and pppi overnight, and it was observed that phonsf and piacp delivered the highest product titers with primary alcohols as acceptors, while phonse accepted only short chain oligophosphates.

1. Schwannomas are rare, benign tumors of the nerve sheath that can cause significant morbidity due to nerve involvement or mass effect.
2. Approximately 25-45% of schwannomas occur in the head and neck, including the vestibular schwannoma (51% of all nerve sheath tumors) and schwannomas of the trigeminal nerve (up to 8%).
3. Vidian nerve schwannomas are much rarer and can present with symptoms such as decreased lacrimation, corneal desiccation, dryness of nasal mucosa, and cluster headaches, as well as compression of the internal carotid artery or expansion into the cavernous sinus.
4. The vidian nerve arises from the joining of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and deep petrosal nerve, with parasympathetic fibers synapsing in the pterygopalatine ganglion and sympathetic fibers innervating the lacrimal gland.
5. Schwannomas of the vidian canal can be treated with endoscopic surgical resection, single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or conventional fractionated radiotherapy using stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT).
6. A 49-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis presented with an incidentally identified 19 x 13 x 10 mm ovoid mass in the right cavernous sinus, which was confirmed to be a schwannoma of the vidian nerve.
7. The patient underwent biopsy and decided to pursue treatment with fractionated radiation therapy due to the benign histology, her young age, and the potential risks of late normal tissue injury.
8. Schwannomas of the vidian canal are extremely rare and may present with symptoms such as headaches, facial pain, facial muscle paralysis, decreased lacrimation, and nasal dryness.

2. The results showed that the addition of intermediate screws at the level of the burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short-segment pedicle fixation, irrespective of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used. However, the increase was more significant for the mpsi construct due to better coupling between the polyaxial screw heads and the connecting rod.

1. The text describes the discovery of electrochemical self-assembly (ESA) of nanostructured hybrid thin films of inorganic semiconductors and organic dyes, which has opened a new synthetic route for obtaining photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This method bypasses the high-temperature sintering required for nanoparticulate TiO2 electrodes, allowing the use of conductive plastic substrates.
2. The researchers have previously demonstrated the use of ESA with ZnO structures for the construction of photoanodes, and have shown that the addition of water-soluble dye molecules with substituents for anchoring to the ZnO surface significantly impacts the crystal growth and evolution of various nanostructures. The coprecipitation of dye molecules does not necessarily deteriorate the crystallinity of ZnO, and in the case of ZnO/eosin Y (EY) hybrid thin films, vertically aligned interconnected and crystalline nanowires of ZnO are formed with aggregates of EY filling the space between the nanowires. The solid EY can be completely removed by soaking the hybrid film in a mild alkaline solution, resulting in porous crystal ZnO with large surface area and high crystallinity for efficient transport of electrons and high incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of around 90%. The researchers are now seeking to find a compatible system for fabricating sensitized photocathodes using this ESA method.

1. The nasopharyngeal bursa originates from the area of communication between the notochord and the foregut, and is a remnant of embryonic communication between the notochord and the roof of the pharynx.
2. Two types of nasopharyngeal bursitis are recognized: the cystic type, which presents with a cyst, and the crust type, which presents with crusts.
3. The crust type was first described by Eagle in 1939, and the orifice of the bursa is not obstructed despite crust formation.
4. The symptoms of the crust type include crust expectoration, retching, and occasional occipital pain, with symptom-free intervals.
5. The incidence of nasopharyngeal bursitis is approximately 4% in adults, and the peak incidence occurs between 15 and 30 years of age.
6. A combined endoscopic nasal and transoral approach using disruption of the bursa with electrocauterization is an effective way of treating both types of nasopharyngeal bursitis.
7. Nasopharyngeal bursa originate at the interface between the embryologic tissue from which the vertebrae develop.
8. The crust type of nasopharyngeal bursitis may develop at any age, without recognized predisposing factors, and may produce no symptoms other than retching and irritative expectoration of crusts.
9. The cystic type of nasopharyngeal bursitis has two subtypes: the classical cyst, which presents with postnasal discharge, throat irritation, and cough, and the fibrosed type, which presents with irritation of the nasopharyngeal area and snoring.

2. High on-treatment platelet reactivity during clopidogrel therapy and low platelet inhibition are associated with increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, particularly stent thrombosis.
3. Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (CYP2C19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis.
4. A recent study suggested that paraoxonase-1 (PON1) may be the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of 2-oxo-clopidogrel to thiol clopidogrel, and a common polymorphism of PON1 (Q192R) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the QQ (AA) haplotype.
5. In two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting, the PON1 (QQ192) genotype was associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis, and reduced plasma activity of PON1 and the PON1 (QQ192) genotype were associated with reduced active thiol metabolite exposure and reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel in a group of patients with a history of prior stent thrombosis.
6. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining the association of common genetic polymorphisms on platelet inhibition only found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 10q24 in linkage equilibrium with the CYP2C19 * 2 loss-of-function variant to be significantly associated with clopidogrel platelet inhibition, and did not find evidence of a significant association of SNPs located on or near the PON1 gene with variation in platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.

Five eyes (9.43%) had open-globe injuries, while 48 (90.56%) had closed-globe injuries. Six patients were referred from other hospitals for further management.
3. Eighteen eyes underwent surgical management, including corneal tear repair, scleral tear repair, cataract extraction, lensectomy, pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and IOFB removal. Twenty-two eyes had a final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/6, while 11 eyes had BCVA between 6/60 and 6/9, and 7 eyes had no perception of light. Five eyes eventually developed phthisis bulbi, of which three underwent secondary enucleation.
4. Firecracker injuries can result in significant ocular morbidity and visual loss. Serious injuries often occur due to the sudden appearance of unpredictable firecrackers. The most common types of firecrackers causing injury were bombs. Corneal abrasions, corneal foreign bodies, and hyphema were the most common anterior segment findings, while vitreous hemorrhage was the most common posterior segment finding.

1. Microbial communities consist of complex networks of interacting strains that differ from monocultures in terms of toxin degradation, natural product production, and capacity to grow in certain environments.
2. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism requires studying the properties of individual strains in pure culture as well as the combinatorial interactions supported by complex communities.
3. Strains may exhibit naturally complementary metabolism or be genetically engineered to interact, sharing metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose.
4. Interacting partners may show enhanced proliferation through the mechanism of invested benefits, where cooperation on the part of one strain augments the growth of the other by increasing its abundance and cultivating the source of metabolites.
5. The growth of a given strain relates to its level of cooperation, as inferred from the growth of its partner strain, and is influenced by the limit of oversharing, where excess cooperation allows one strain to monopolize the batch culture and limit the growth of the other.
6. Synthetic genetic interactions, such as smit interactions, can be applied to infer properties of the e. coli metabolic network by identifying epistatic or modular relationships among genes.
7. Metabolic network stoichiometries can be used to infer biochemical reaction rates through the method of flux balance analysis, which can be extended to a system of two interacting strains to allow for the free exchange of metabolites between them.
8. The efficiency of cooperation between two strains can be calculated as the ratio of the benefit received by one strain to the production cost incurred by the other, providing insights into the complex emergent phenotype of metabolic interactions.

1. Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome (BSS) is a rare genodermatosis caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene cyld (cylindromatosis gene) on chromosome 16q12q13.
2. BSS is characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, mainly trichoepiteliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas.
3. The risk of malignancy is low, but patients require long-term follow-up.
4. A 71-year-old woman was evaluated due to the progressive development of asymptomatic lesions in her head, which were diagnosed as spiradenomas and cylindromas.
5. The woman's family history suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease, with affected relatives having similar lesions.
6. Exon 8 sequencing of the cyld gene revealed a heterozygous mutation c. 1628_1629delct in the patient and her two affected daughters.
7. The loss of deubiquitinating activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis, and germline mutations predispose to the disease.
8. BSS is characterized by the progressive development of adnexal skin tumors in the scalp and face, with clinical manifestations starting since puberty and a higher incidence in females.
9. The genetic study of BSS revealed the existence of the heterozygous mutation c. 1628_1629delct, which is associated with multiple trichoepitheliomas and confirms the diagnosis of BSS in the described family.

1. Biological scaffolds derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa have been used for soft tissue repair applications due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria. These materials are particularly useful in contaminated settings.
2. Dexon and Vicryl, absorbable polymer scaffolds, have been used for damage control applications but lose mechanical strength and are resorbed quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications. Newer absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly.
3. Phasix Mesh, a copolymer of poly(glycolide : trimethylene carbonate), has been evaluated in a porcine model for hernia repair applications and demonstrated similar mechanical properties, resorption profile, and histological characteristics to the native abdominal wall. The repair sites exhibited significantly greater burst strength and relative stiffness compared to the native abdominal wall, indicating the potential of the p4hb material to augment the strength of the native tissue.

1. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, specifically vancomycin resistance (VRE), has been a significant issue in healthcare settings for over 25 years.
2. VRE is mediated by van genes, with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent.
3. Several European countries have reported an increase in VRE in recent years, with Denmark experiencing a dramatic increase since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks of vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium.
4. Current guidelines recommend screening of patients at risk and implementation of isolation precautions for VRE carriers, which relies on selective culturing and/or detection of resistance genes vanA or vanB by PCR.
5. Rapidly available results from VRE screening can lead to substantial indirect savings, as highlighted by a report from France.
6. Several studies have examined the diagnostic accuracy of various assays to detect vanA and vanB, with sensitivities ranging from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6%.
7. The specificity of the detection of the vanB gene is lower due to the presence of vanB-positive anaerobic bacteria.
8. In autumn 2014, the laboratory implemented the Xpert vanA/vanB assay, which provides results within an hour and was used to guide rapid implementation of infection control measures.

2. The study found that ru resulted in the most rapid recovery in cf within the first 10 minutes of reperfusion for cf when given before ischemia and in + dp/dt and pmax when administered after ischemia in control hearts. In diabetic hearts, ru, ru + los, and triple therapy similarly gave the most rapid recovery within 10 minutes of reperfusion for lvedp when given before ischemia. Cap + los therapy given before ischemia in diabetic hearts resulted in a very rapid improvement in pmax and cf within the first 10 minutes of reperfusion that was almost the maximal recovery obtained.
3. The study showed that triple therapy (capt + los + ru) yielded the best recovery in pmax of about 74% improvement over controls, irrespective of whether it was administered before or after ischemia. Capt + los was equally effective as the triple combination, and capt + ru double combination was not significantly better than any of the single therapies. However, when single drugs were administered after ischemia in diabetic hearts, there was no significant improvement in pmax with ru.
4. The study highlighted the importance of identifying the optimal treatment strategy of raas blockade to prevent or treat ischemia-reperfusion injury in normal and diabetic hearts. The study showed that ru was generally better in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts compared to treatment with an acei (capt) or arb (los) alone. In diabetic hearts, ru was generally similarly effective as capt or los treatment, and dual therapies involving ru were similarly effective as capt + los therapy. Triple combination was generally equal to or the most effective strategy in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal or diabetic hearts.

1. Modern nasal surgery aims to enhance cosmetic appearance and improve natural nose functions.
2. Acoustic rhinometry (AR) is a common method for measuring nasal cavity geometry, which has a close correlation with the cross-sectional area measured by rhinomanometry.
3. AR is easy to perform and requires less cooperation from subjects, but nose geometry can be influenced by various factors including race, age, sex, height, weight, and smoking habit.
4. The study evaluated changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers after cosmetic rhinoplasty using AR and compared pre- and post-surgery differences in length, minimal cross-sectional area (MCA), and volume of each nasal cavity.
5. The study included 24.63 (4.4) year-old healthy Iranian volunteers without prior nose surgery, fracture, allergy, asthma, or sinus disorders, who were visited in the ent clinic of Rassul-e-Akram Teaching Hospital between 2006 and 2008.
6. The surgeries were open rhinoplasty with or without septoplasty, and the type of osteotomy, placement of columellar strut, or other variations were dependent on the surgeon's preference.
7. The study found that bilateral d1 and both MCA2 decreased significantly, while there was a significant increase in MCA1 postoperatively. Cases with septoplasty experienced more increase in MCA1 and less constriction in MCA2. Double osteotomy positively affected nose function by more increase in MCA1. Placing a strut was beneficial for patients in both groups.
8. AR is a reliable method for determining functional and geometric changes in the nasal cavity, and it can provide objective documentation and diagnosis for better treatment of nasal airway blockage.

2. Numerous examples of inflammation-induced cancers include acid reflux-induced esophageal adenocarcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease-associated colon cancer, and hepatocellular neoplasms associated with chronic viral hepatitis.
3. Pelayo Correa, a Colombian pathologist, devoted his career to understanding the etiology of gastric cancer. In 1975, he published a model for gastric cancer development, hypothesizing that chronic atrophic gastritis leads to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over several decades.
4. Correa initially thought that environmental factors, such as a diet high in salt and nitroso-compounds and low in micronutrients, were responsible for promoting this progression. He briefly discussed a possible role for Campylobacter pylori in the initiation of the disease in his 1988 publication.
5. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall discovered H. pylori in 1982 and showed that it causes gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Although they did not investigate the role of H. pylori in gastric cancer directly, they were aware of the relationship between gastritis and cancer.
6. Initial investigations into the association between H. pylori and gastric cancer provided weak evidence for a link. However, three large cohort studies with nested case-controls, conducted in the late 1990s, found that prior H. pylori infection significantly increased the risk of gastric cancer.
7. Subsequent research has confirmed and expanded upon the early epidemiologic studies, with key additional clinical findings including the role of H. pylori in diffuse-type gastric cancer, the underestimation of prior exposure by ELISA, and the increased risk of gastric cancer from CAGA-positive strains.

1. The past 20 years have seen the development of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) signaling pathway in cancer. Avastin (bevacizumab), a VEGFA mAb, has been successful in treating colorectal, lung, and renal cell carcinomas.
2. However, the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments have been highlighted by the recent withdrawal of avastin for breast cancer treatment in the US. Resistance to avastin and the role of other growth factors in sustaining tumor angiogenesis have been identified. Alternative ligands for the angiogenic receptor VEGFR-2, such as VEGFC and VEGFD, and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families are being explored as potential candidates for promoting resistance to avastin.
3. PIGF, a ligand for VEGFR-1, has been reported to play a dual role in cancer as a stimulator of angiogenesis and as an autocrine or paracrine factor promoting proliferation of tumor cells expressing VEGFR-1. Its role in driving tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth is context-dependent, and it may modulate the effect of VEGFA by displacing VEGFA from VEGFR-1 expressed on endothelial cells.
4. The growth factors VEGFC and VEGFD, which are closely related to VEGFA, have been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, solid tumor growth, and lymphatic and distant organ metastasis. Targeting the VEGFD signaling pathway could inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, restricting both solid tumor growth and metastatic spread.

2. In Iran, Plasmodium vivax is the most common malaria species, accounting for the majority of cases, while Plasmodium falciparum accounts for a smaller percentage. The country entered the malaria pre-elimination program in 2009 and has implemented prevention strategies, active case detection, and timely appropriate treatment in all endemic areas.
3. Active surveillance using precise laboratory methods is crucial for early recognition of all parasite carriers, particularly those with asymptomatic infections and low parasite densities. While light microscopy is the standard method for malaria diagnosis, chromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and molecular methods such as nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are also used as complementary methods.

3. Other agents, like monoclonal antibodies targeting T-cell checkpoint inhibitors (Ipilimumab, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for advanced melanoma, have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials and are anticipated for approval.
4. However, evaluating these agents using traditional clinical development paradigms has been challenging due to their potential combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies.

2. The most common CAH variant is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
3. CAH patients with 21-OHD experience hyperplasia of the adrenal gland due to decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in diversion of cortisol and aldosterone precursors to androgens.
4. CAH patients exhibit different clinical forms, including classical CAH (salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms) and non-classical CAH (asymptomatic or postnatal/adult onset hyperandrogenism).
5. CAH treatment involves replacement of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and suppress abnormal androgen secretion. However, conventional glucocorticoid replacement cannot mimic natural cortisol rhythms, leading to over-suppression or under-suppression.
6. Studies suggest high concordance rates between genotype and phenotype in patients with classic CAH. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities have been reported in CAH patients, including white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis.
7. The present study investigated the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in 26 CAH patients due to 21-OHD. The sample included all CAH patients aged more than 16 years and regularly followed at the Department of Endocrinology in Mahdia and Sfax, Tunisia.

1. In the 1960s, McCulloch and Till identified three functional characteristics of stem cells: self-renewal, proliferation, and multipotency. These findings supported the hypothesis that a specific population of cells was responsible for propagation and sustained growth in a hierarchical manner.
2. Stem cells have been identified throughout the lung, including in proximal and middle airways, by their role in response to injury. In the trachea, basal cells expressing either keratin-5 (k5) or keratin-14 (k14) have been identified as capable of stem-like behavior. In the middle airways, mature clara cells have been identified as facultative progenitor cells, capable of proliferating into phenotypically diverse progeny.
3. Recent studies have identified tumor cell subpopulations within lung cancer specimens that exhibit stem-like properties, including multidrug resistance, increased telomerase expression, and self-renewal. CD133 cells isolated from human lung cancer specimens can grow indefinitely in culture and proliferate into phenotypically diverse tumors. Patients with lung tumors enriched with these CD133 lung cancer stem cells tend to have worse prognosis and increased resistance to cisplatin-based therapies.
4. The hierarchical or cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that relatively rare, multipotent cells gain unlimited proliferative potential, leading to tumor growth and heterogeneity. Stem-like cells, with the ability to rapidly proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny, could act as cancer stem cells.
5. The study of lung epithelial response to airway injury has shown compelling evidence for the role of stem cells in airway repair. There is growing evidence to suggest that these same lung stem cells may play a key role in the initiation and proliferation of human lung cancers. However, the relationship between healthy adult stem cells and lung cancer, as well as the tumor microenvironment and lung cancer stem cells, remains poorly characterized.

4. Group B patients with a urethral plate width of <8 mm had a statistically significant higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibration compared to group A patients with a urethral plate width of >8 mm (p = 0.004 and p = 0.01, respectively).
5. The aim of hypospadias surgery is to create a straight penis with a slit-like meatus at the tip of the glans with enough skin coverage.
6. Tip urethroplasty is the most common procedure used for hypospadias repair since its introduction in 1994.
7. The urethral plate shape and width are evaluated when tip repair is opted for hypospadias management.
8. Narrow plates (<8 mm) are inadequate for creating neourethra, which might be the cause of the statistically significant higher fistula rate in group B patients with urethral plate width <8 mm.
9. Modification to midline incision of the plate by extending it beyond the tip of the glans prevents meatal stenosis but only decreases fistula rate and meatal stenosis to <1%.
10. Urethral plate augmentation is recommended when the urethral plate is narrow and inelastic, requiring augmentation with free graft.

1. The study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo using a strain gauge connected directly to the pliers.
2. The prototype consisted of a modified plier, a measurement and control circuit, and a pc with specific software.
3. The prototype was calibrated using weights and the data was adjusted using a simple linear regression analysis.
4. The accuracy and precision of the prototype were tested using weights and the results showed no significant differences between examiners.
5. The mean bond strength obtained with the prototype and in vitro using a universal testing machine were statistically similar, suggesting the prototype could be a useful tool for measuring bond strength in vivo.
</summary>

Additionally, the text mentioned that material biodegradation can interfere with the bonding between the bracket and enamel, causing lower bond strength values in vivo compared to in vitro. The study also assessed the adhesive remnant index (ARI) after debonding and found that score 3, which indicates all composite resin left on the tooth with a distinct impression of the bracket mesh, was predominant in both groups. Debonding with the prototype was shown to be a safe method for preserving the enamel surface.",1,{'n_points': 5}

1. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a symptomatic generalized epilepsy syndrome characterized by tonic, atonic, and atypical absence seizures, slow spike wave discharges on EEG, cognitive impairment, and various etiologies.
2. The interictal awake EEG pattern consists of slow spike wave discharges (<3 Hz) with a generalized distribution, and paroxysms of low voltage fast activity (about 10 Hz) during sleep.
3. LGS affects approximately 2-5% of childhood epilepsies, with a poor prognosis regarding both seizures and cognitive outcome.
4. Risk factors for a poor cognitive prognosis include symptomatic etiology, history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, prior infantile spasms, and early age of seizure onset.
5. Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS, although caution is needed in children under 2 years old and when used with several other anticonvulsants.
6. Felbamate, lamotrigine, and topiramate have shown some efficacy in reducing seizures in LGS, but no head-to-head trials comparing more than one drug have been published.
7. Clobazam significantly reduced both drop and non-drop seizures in a dose-dependent manner in patients with LGS, with fewer sedative effects than other benzodiazepines.
8. Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is an orphan drug granted for the adjunctive treatment of LGS in the US and has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness, decreased firing of high-frequency sodium-dependent action potentials, and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.

1. The study explores the role of chemical sexual signals in interpopulational recognition between five distinct populations of iberian wall lizards in central Spain. The populations inhabit different environments without geographical barriers but maintain clear distinct morphotypes and differ genetically.
2. Morphological differences and chemical analyses of femoral gland secretions suggest that interpopulational variations in chemical signals could allow chemosensory recognition between populations and lead to premating boundaries. Tongue-flick experiments confirmed that males and females discriminated by chemosensory cues alone between scents of lizards from different populations.
3. Results showed that male and female p. hispanica lizards from five distinct populations of the Madrid region can recognize and discriminate between scents of individuals from the northern and southern populations. Males from some populations discriminate and maybe prefer scents of females from their own population than from any other populations, suggesting a cryptic speciation process. Females also discriminate male chemicals between areas but not between populations.

1. According to WHO experts, if rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, the potential of passing the virus to the fetus is about 90%. The most significant complication of rubella is Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.
2. Rubella vaccination aims to prevent congenital infection with rubella virus and CRS. The most commonly used vaccine globally is derived from the ra27/3 virus strain, which makes more immunity and induces seroconversion in 95% of vaccinated persons.
3. In various studies conducted in different regions of Iran, immunity against rubella ranged from 85.83% to 96.5%. Before the mass rubella vaccination in 2003, the immunity rate was significantly lower.
4. A study conducted in Kermanshah, Iran, in 2006, revealed a significant rise of 19.7% (95% ci 12.7%-26.7%) in seropositivity and immunity against rubella in vaccinated versus unvaccinated girls.
5. Mass rubella vaccination in Iran resulted in a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibody from 20.42% to 0.7%.
6. The effectiveness of the ra27/3 vaccine has been demonstrated by the elimination of rubella and CRS from the western hemisphere and high vaccination coverage in several European countries.
7. Due to the susceptibility of less than 1% of the kermanshahi girls at marriage and the awareness of the lack of immunity in pregnant women, it is proposed to perform studies on the immunity status against other diseases like tetanus and diphtheria. Additionally, periodic studies on rubella seroepidemiology and vaccination of vulnerable society members are recommended.

1. The text describes the use of quantum dots (QDs) for nonamplified fluorescent whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) in xenopus embryos, which overcomes the limitations of traditional chromogenic WISH and provides higher resolution and more accurate determination of transcript expression patterns.
2. QDs have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching. These properties make QDs an ideal candidate for detecting multiple mRNAs in WISH protocols.
3. The study shows that proteinase k treatment facilitates QD penetration in xenopus embryos and allows specific deep tissue staining, and that anti-digoxigenin-conjugated QDs can give highly specific staining of dig-labeled mRNA probes, even in deep tissues. The results suggest that use of anti-dig conjugated QDs in WISH can give more accurate determination of transcript expression patterns and enable simultaneous detection of multiple transcripts.

2. The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential.
3. The median survival time after PDAC diagnosis is about four months, and only 19% of patients survive past one year and 2% survive past five years.
4. Demographic and clinical factors, such as gender, race, age, marital status, tumor size, nodal status, and distant metastases, influence the survival of PDAC patients.
5. Surgical resection of the tumor is the most effective treatment for PDAC, but only 20% of patients are suitable for this procedure.
6. Cox proportional hazards regression models have been used to estimate the impact of risk factors on the survival of PDAC patients.
7. Two nomograms have been developed to estimate the survival and risk of perioperative mortality in PDAC patients based on demographic, clinical, and treatment factors.
8. A web-based, real-time prognostic tool was developed using SEER data to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities for PDAC patients, with an average c-index of 0.700 and 0.711 for localized and extended PDAC, respectively.
9. The lpdac and epdac models have high reproducibility and generalizability, allowing for the development of a real-time prognostic estimator to assess conditional survival probabilities and their standard errors for patients diagnosed with PDAC.

2. Diagnosis and management of CLI were based on TASC or TASC II consensus. PTA was the first-choice procedure for revascularization, and its indication was determined by consensus among vascular specialists.
3. PTA was not feasible for heavily calcified and/or diffusely occluded lesions, but poor-risk patients were not necessarily contraindications for PTA.
4. Major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions, and its indication was determined by consensus among plastic surgeons.
5. Preoperative variables considered in the analyses were sex, age, ADLs, Fontaine stage, presence of infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, receiving regular hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.
6. Diabetic patients had a significantly higher prevalence of Fontaine stage IV and hemodialysis than those without diabetes.
7. The follow-up period was 1.7-1.4 years, and 48 patients underwent major amputations and 89 died. The leading cause of death was cardiac and vascular disease.
8. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputation compared with nondiabetic patients, but they had a similar life prognosis.

The study involved obtaining serum samples from 50 CE patients, 40 non-CE patients, and 20 healthy controls. All CE patients underwent surgical procedures after receiving standard antihelminthic treatment.
2. The results revealed that the antigenic bands of 52, 24, 39, 46, 63, and 6061 kDa, which were reactive to 72.09%, 62.79%, 60.46%, 48.83%, 34.88%, and 30.23% of pre-operative patients, were specific for hydatid disease. The 39 kDa band reactivity decreased significantly from 60.46% in pre-operative samples to 35.71% with six months, 21.42% with one year, and 7.5% with two years follow-up. However, 24 kDa and 39 kDa persisted in two patients who had a relapse at two-year follow-up. The antigenic fractions of 52, 46, 39, and 24 kDa in combination may serve as useful diagnostic markers.

2. The study found that patients in obesity class III had lower mean serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to patients in classes I and II. This difference was not related to lipid-lowering treatment.
3. Negative correlations were observed between BMI, waist circumference (WC), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Positive correlations were found between WC, waist-to-height ratio (WHTR), VAI, and triglycerides (TG), as well as between TC, LDL-C, and TG/HDL-C ratio.
4. The study also noted that lipid disorders were the most frequent concomitant disorders in the study population, and that increasing BMI results in decreasing HDL-C levels and increasing TG levels. The study suggested that VAI may be the most valuable obesity index in obese patients with dyslipidemias due to its strong relationship with the lipid profile.

The study found that among the total sample eligible for aspirin as primary prevention, less than a third reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin, and fewer than half of high-risk primary prevention patients received a recommendation. Of those told to take aspirin, the vast majority complied. However, there was a significant disconnect between risk for future CVd and aspirin recommendations, and decisions for treatment recommendations seemed to be based on criteria other than objectively calculated future CHD risk.

2. Cellular thioredoxin and glutathione reductase systems restore these oxidatively modified residues back to their reduced forms.
3. Mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generation is required for the propagation of numerous cellular signaling pathways, including those regulating tumorigenesis, immune responses, and cellular adaptation to stresses such as hypoxia. mROS play key roles in cellular differentiation programs, including stem cell differentiation.
4. In the epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium, mROS production promotes signaling through pathways required for differentiation of mammalian stem cell populations in vivo. mROS are required for activation of the Notch and β-catenin transcriptional programs that promote epidermal differentiation and hair growth respectively.
5. Mitochondrial metabolism promotes cellular differentiation by providing substrates for histone acetyltransferases and histone demethylases, which regulate histone acetylation and methylation status. Availability of acetyl-CoA, a key fuel for oxidative metabolism, is crucial for histone acetylation and subsequent differentiation.

2. Frog metamorphosis is used to investigate thyroid toxicity due to their susceptibility to contaminants and the regulation of metamorphosis by thyroid hormones.
3. Thyroid hormones (THs) are secreted by the thyroid gland and converted to the more active form, triiodothyronine (T3), in peripheral tissues.
4. THs are transported in the blood bound to transport proteins, primarily transthyretin (TTR), and undergo conjugation and degradation processes in the liver.
5. Several processes influence TH balance, including sulfation, deiodination, and glucuronidation, which can be disrupted by environmental contaminants.
6. Inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake and suppression of thyroidal peroxidase activity can disrupt TH synthesis and secretion.
7. Inhibition of 5-deiodinase in peripheral tissues reduces conversion from T4 to T3, while induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes increases excretion of both T4 and T3 into bile.
8. Chemicals can interfere with T3 binding to TTR, altering plasma TH homeostasis and potentially affecting free concentration and plasma clearance rate.

3. The ratio and stereocomposition of EET isomers are isoform-dependent and species-specific.
4. EET is susceptible to aerial or auto-oxidation, necessitating handling and storage under strict conditions to minimize exposure to oxygen and trace transition metals.
5. Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH) is an indirect means for pharmacologic intervention in EET-mediated processes.
6. However, this strategy might be less efficacious than agonist replacement therapy when endogenous EET biosynthesis is compromised.
7. Previous laboratories prepared EET surrogates with improved stability, which were evaluated for vasorelaxation and SEH inhibition.
8. The simple expedient of conjugating the carboxylate with a short poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) unit improved both vasorelaxation and the EC50 for SEH inhibition.

2. Perforin deficiency, which is linked to complex changes in leukocyte populations, presents a selective defect in granulocyte production that can be corrected by wild-type lymphocyte transfer.
3. In the absence of allergen sensitization and challenge, pfp mice have reduced granulocyte numbers both inside and outside of bone marrow, relative to wild-type controls.
4. Liquid bone marrow cultures showed that il-5 and dexamethasone stimulated eosinopoiesis in wild-type bone marrow but not in pfp bone marrow, although il-5 was sufficient to sustain eosinopoiesis in the absence of dexamethasone.
5. Semisolid bone marrow cultures showed that perforin-deficient bone marrow progenitors formed fewer colonies and did not respond to dexamethasone, which significantly enhances colony formation in wild-type cultures.
6. Dexamethasone injection increased bone marrow eosinophils and neutrophils in wild-type b6 mice but not in pfp mice, and the effect on the thymus was abolished by ru486 pretreatment in both cases.
7. Transfer of splenic lymphocytes from naive wild-type mice, but not pfp mice, was able to reconstitute the granulopoietic responses to dexamethasone in the short term, but different cells may be involved in reconstitution of lineage-specific responses.

1. The A1chieve study assessed the safety and effectiveness of insulin analogues in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in routine clinical care, with a total of 66,726 patients.
2. The majority of patients (73.9%) started on or switched to biphasic insulin aspart. Other groups included insulin detemir, insulin aspart, basal insulin plus insulin aspart, and other insulin combinations.
3. After 24 weeks of treatment, overall hypoglycaemic events reduced from 1.5 events/patient-year to zero events in the insulin user group, while hypoglycaemia remained nil in the insulin naive group.
4. Demographic data showed a decrease in blood pressure and an improvement in overall lipid profile and quality of life at week 24 for the entire cohort.
5. Of the 1561 patients who started on biphasic insulin aspart, hypoglycaemic events reduced from 1.2 events/patient-year to 0.0 events/patient-year in the insulin user group, while hypoglycaemia was nil in the insulin naive group. Quality of life improved after 24 weeks of treatment.
6. All parameters of glycaemic control improved from baseline to study end for those who started on or were switched to biphasic insulin aspart for both insulin nave and insulin user groups.
7. Similar improvements in glycaemic control and quality of life were observed for those who started on or were switched to basal+insulin aspart, insulin detemir, or insulin aspart.
8. No major hypoglycaemic events or episodes occurred in any of the study patients. The trend indicates that insulin analogues can be considered effective and safe for treating T2DM in Mumbai, India, although the findings are limited by the number of patients.

1. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts, and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells have been extensively studied for their potential in cardiac regeneration. ESCs can be obtained from the inner cell mass of a pre-implantation blastocyst and differentiated into cardiovascular lineages in vitro.
2. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from adult somatic cells by overexpressing transcription factors and yield functional cardiovascular lineages. iPSCs may provide an unlimited supply of autologous donor cells once technological advancements eliminate the risk of tumor formation.
3. MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow and adipose tissues and differentiated into cardiomyocytes under special conditions. They can be rapidly expanded in culture and are less immunogenic than other cell populations, allowing for allogenic transplantation. However, their propensity to differentiate into non-cardiac tissues limits their use.
4. Skeletal myoblasts can be harvested from muscle biopsies, expanded in culture, and autologously reimplanted. They are less prone to teratoma formation and more resistant to ongoing ischemia than ESCs. However, true cardiomyocyte differentiation has not been observed in vivo, and their contractions are dyssynchronous due to failure of electromechanical coupling with the surrounding myocardium.
5. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, can be mobilized or harvested and differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in vitro. After transplant, they can supply a broad range of paracrine factors with proangiogenic, positive remodeling, and antiapoptotic properties. Clinical trials have shown improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct scar size, and left ventricular end-systolic volume after intracoronary infusion of adult bone marrow-derived stem cells.

1. Polyhalite is a mineral commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions and rare cases in volcanic successions. It was first described in Austria in 1818 by German chemist Stromeyer.
2. Polyhalite is associated with halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides. Its crystal structure was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria.
3. Polyhalite can be synthesised under laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4MgSO4H2O at temperatures above 70°C.
4. The dehydration temperature of polyhalite starts at 255°C and reaches a maximum of 343°C. Substitution of divalent cations by other elements significantly changes dehydration reactions.
5. Polyhalite forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact.
6. Polyhalite occurs in various microfabric types, including fibrous polyhalite in veins, porphyroblasts of polyhalite in anhydrite, and dense polyhalite comprising corroded large anhydrite grains.
7. The alpine Haselgebirge sulphates have experienced temperatures between 235 and 2025 million years ago, and polyhalite's presence in these rocks makes it interesting for absolute age dating.

2. Propofol, a widely used anesthetic, has antioxidant properties and ameliorates oxidative injury in several organs.
3. In this study, propofol was administered to rats at doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for four weeks, and serum and tissue samples were collected for analysis.
4. The study found no significant difference in serum, renal, and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels between control and propofol-treated rats, indicating that propofol metabolism does not generate free radicals within the animal tissues.
5. However, propofol at both doses significantly increased serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol levels and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels.
6. The increased cholesterol level during propofol administration may be linked to increased alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coA reductase activity, while the increased triglycerides levels may be due to decreased triglycerides lipase activity or decreased fatty oxidation.
7. Propofol at 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses increased hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, enhancing the detoxifying potential of the animals.

1. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a rare condition caused by deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus.
2. The prevalence of IHH is about 1/10,000 in men and 1/50,000 in women, with a m/f ratio of 4-5:1.
3. Due to the rarity of the condition, comprehensive assessment of IHH is often difficult for a single clinical center, leading to the use of multicenter trials for large-scale studies.
4. With the widespread availability of networks and the increase in internet users, disease-specific social groups have formed to share knowledge and experience, enabling medical researchers to conduct research through networks.
5. Network investigation is a new modality of medical research that can cover large populations with low investigation costs, especially for rare diseases.
6. In the present study, clinical data of IHH patients in China was collected through network questionnaires and medical records for comparison with previous studies.
7. The study found that of the 74 IHH patients, all were males with a mean age of 27.3 years, mean age at disease onset of 15.2 years, and a mean disease duration of 12.1 years.
8. The study also found that 38 (51.4%) patients had hyposmia or anosmia and 69 (93.2%) presented with obvious pubertal delay.
9. The therapeutic protocols for IHH patients included testosterone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), or a random combination of them.

1. Non-surgical endodontic retreatment is the primary choice for eliminating microbial content from endodontically failed teeth, but well-compacted root fillings can restrict access to the apical foramen and impair root canal disinfection.
2. Protaper universal rotary files (RFS) are used to remove the bulk of gutta-percha-based fillings, but complete removal is not gained.
3. Debris extruded during retreatment can cause postoperative inflammation, flare-ups, and impaired healing.
4. Recent studies suggest the inability of universal protaper RFS to entirely remove root canal fillings and propose the use of supplementary files to aid removal of residual root filling materials.
5. The current study aimed to evaluate the extrusion of debris apically after the use of protaper universal RFS and different finishing files for removing residual root canal fillings.
6. The finishing files used were protaper next (ptn), waveone (wo), and self-adjusting file (saf). The null hypothesis was that the three different supplementary files would exhibit no significant differences in the amount of debris extruded.
7. The study found that wo files extruded significantly more debris (27% increase) compared to ptn (19% increase) and saf (12% increase) when used as supplementary files after using protaper universal RFS.
8. The saf group was associated with the lowest percentage of debris extruded apically (12%) due to its hollow design, which adapts to canal irregularities and allows for continuous irrigation, preventing pressure build-up and facilitating easy removal of debris.

1. The text describes a study on the effectiveness of the anterior and middle superior alveolar (AMSA) nerve block technique for anesthetizing multiple maxillary teeth using a conventional syringe. The technique aims to anesthetize 10 maxillary teeth extending from the second premolar of one side to the opposite side without causing anesthesia of the facial muscles.
2. The study involved 30 Caucasian patients who received an AMSA nerve block on one side of the maxilla using a conventional syringe. The results showed that the anesthetic success ranged from 16.7 to 66.6%, with an average induction time of 8 minutes and a duration of anesthetic success ranging from 23 to 40 minutes. All patients obtained palatal soft tissue anesthesia, but no patient obtained pulpal anesthesia from the second premolar to the central incisor or facial anesthesia.
3. The main theoretical advantage of the AMSA nerve block is that it reduces the number of injections and the quantity of anesthetic solution administered in comparison with conventional supraperiosteal infiltrative anesthesia. It is also ideal for cosmetic dentistry as it does not cause numbness of the lip and face. However, the low success rates of conventional syringe system could be due to the superiority of computer-controlled systems to inject the anesthetic solution with a controlled and continuous flow.
4. The text also discusses the infraorbital nerve block (IONB) as an alternative technique for anesthetizing multiple maxillary teeth with a single injection. The IONB has better success rates of pulpal anesthetic but causes facial numbness. The authors conclude that both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific clinical situation.

2. TADs, which range from 100 kb up to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions.
3. TAD boundaries are stable across different species, cell types, and cellular conditions, and are enriched for specific proteins, histone modifications, and replication timing.
4. The underlying features that generate invariant TAD boundaries remain unknown, but they have been associated with the enrichment of CTCF, cohesin, DNase I hypersensitivity, certain histone marks, and the timing of replication domains.
5. In Drosophila, the combinatorial binding of different types of insulators is associated with the strength of the TAD boundary.
6. Brg1, the major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, contributes to TAD boundary strength and regulates nucleosome occupancy and possibly CTCF localization.
7. Brg1 knockdown results in reduced nucleosome occupancy around CTCF sites, decreased TAD boundary strength, and a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions.

1. The text discusses the complex nature of appetite control, which involves inputs from both physiological and environmental sources. Early theories focused on signals from glucose metabolism, amino acids, or adipose tissue, but more recent models emphasize inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, along with sensory features of food.
2. Major signals include leptin from adipose tissue and hormones such as ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, CCK, amylin, and insulin from specialized cells in the gastrointestinal tract or associated organs. These models help identify specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centered on the hypothalamus.
3. An alternative approach to appetite control comes from the study of energy balance and the interrelationships between energy expenditure and energy intake. Any increase in energy expenditure will be met with an equivalent increase in energy intake, but daily energy expenditure can fluctuate markedly, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) provides a tonic signal of energy demand that could act as a driver of daily energy intake. Physical activity energy expenditure exerts a different type of control over appetite due to its intensity and sporadic nature, and exercise can raise resting energy expenditure several fold, leading to complex effects on appetite control.

2. Heat-polymerized PMMA resin is commonly used for denture base fabrication, but it can lead to dimensional changes and inaccuracies in the fit of the denture base. Chemically activated resins, which have a higher solubility and inferior color stability, display less polymerization shrinkage and greater dimensional accuracy.
3. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins. The results showed that the bond strength was significantly affected by the type of acrylic resin and surface treatment, but the interaction between these two factors was not statistically significant.
4. The surface treatment with monomer improved the bond strength between denture teeth and denture base resins, and most of the futura gen specimens showed adhesive failure, while meliodent specimens had predominantly mixed failure.
5. Other studies have reported that the bond strength of acrylic teeth to denture base resin depends on the rate of monomer diffusion and polymerization temperature.

1. Small RNA molecules, including short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and small activating RNAs (sarna), play crucial roles in regulating various molecular and biological activities in cells.
2. RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence-specific downregulation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of targeted mRNAs.
3. In addition to RISC-mediated regulation at the post-transcriptional level, RNAi can also modulate gene transcription itself.
4. In fission yeast, homologs of the RISC can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone-modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding RNAs, a mechanism also seen in plants, ciliates, nematodes, and flies.
5. Small promoter-targeted RNAs have been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing.
6. In human cells, short RNAs targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon called RNA activation (RNAa).
7. The present study focuses on the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming using sarna.

3. Autophagy plays an indispensable role in antigen presentation to antigen-specific T cells by promoting the presentation of viral and self-antigens by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. It also controls the MHC class I-dependent presentation of viral antigens to CD8 T cells.

5. The incidence of oral cancer in India is high, with 12.5 cases per 100,000 people, and the majority of oral cancer patients are in India.
6. The major cause of oral cancer in India is the rampant use of betel nut, betel quid, and gutkha, which are proven to be carcinogens.
7. Betel nut contains alkaloids that affect the nervous system and can cause addiction, mood swings, anxiety, irritability, loss of concentration, sleep disturbance, and craving.
8. Betel nut is the fourth most common addictive substance after tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine, and it is possibly the second most consumed carcinogen in the Indian subcontinent.
9. The betel nut industry employs nearly 10 million people in India, and most of the production is consumed domestically due to its limited export potential.
10. The promotion of betel nut products as mouth fresheners is misleading, and the lack of statutory warning, low cost, easy availability, attractive packaging, and aggressive marketing contribute to their popularity.

1. The concept of patient blood management is gaining importance due to the risks and costs associated with allogeneic red blood cell transfusions. Postoperative severe bleeding is common in cardiac surgery, especially in patients with advanced age and long cardiopulmonary bypass. Excessive bleeding can be caused by surgical factors and impaired haemostasis.
2. Several studies have reported higher long-term mortality after blood transfusion, but not all studies agree and some indicate no difference in mortality or increased bleeding without effect on mortality. Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, are commonly used in coronary artery bypass graft patients and can both reduce ischemic events and increase bleeding.
3. Oxygen delivery in the body is determined by cardiac output, haemoglobin level, and oxygenation. If oxygen delivery is out of balance with oxygen consumption, compensation mechanisms can increase cardiac index or oxygen extraction. Oxygen is carried in the blood primarily by haemoglobin, but a small amount is dissolved in plasma. Patients with coexisting cardiac diseases may have impaired oxygenation at lower haemoglobin levels, but the evidence is not conclusive.

1. Neurogenesis occurs in specific tissues of the nervous system after birth, including the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subventricular zone, and olfactory epithelium.
2. The olfactory epithelium has the unique capacity to renew olfactory receptor neurons throughout adult life and contains neural stem cells and non-neural support cells.
3. Globose basal cells (gbcs) are a population of cells in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium with stem-cell like properties and are capable of giving rise to neurons and non-neuronal cell types.
4. Studies suggest that gbcs function as broadly multipotent progenitors and may be totipotent stem cells of the epithelium.
5. Olfactory epithelial stem cells are the ideal candidate for use in clinical research and therapy due to their accessibility, ease of biopsy, and complete regeneration without loss of function.
6. Researchers are studying different neural progenitor markers and ionic channels present on gbcs to characterize these cells as definitive multipotent stem cells.
7. Albino wistar rats were used in the study due to their similarities to humans and the ease of access to their olfactory mucosa.
8. The study used specific markers, determination of various transcription factor expressions, and analytical studies to identify the lineage relationship between the two basal cell populations in the olfactory epithelium.
9. The research aims to characterize gbcs as neural progenitor cells by immunostaining with multiple neural progenitor stem cell markers.

1. Microglia, once considered immune privileged cells in the central nervous system (CNS), now play a crucial role in innate immunity within the CNS. They are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and develop into immature and mature cells before invading the developing brain at e9.5. Microglia are multifunctional and involved in immune surveillance, inflammatory response, phagocytosis, synaptic refinement, and angiogenesis.
2. The glymphatic system, an interstitial fluid/cerebrospinal fluid exchange system located in the perivascular space, facilitates immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid. This system enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes, allowing for the clearance of interstitial solutes and the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid into meningeal lymphatic vessels.
3. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of depolarization and electrical silence in the brain, accompanied by secondary changes in cerebral blood flow. CSD can be elicited by various stimuli and is associated with microglial activation, inflammatory responses, and synaptic alterations. Microglia express voltage-sensitive ion channels and can sense electrical activity pertaining to CSD.
4. The mechanisms by which microglia induce CSD remain unknown, but they may be involved in raising extracellular potassium concentration before CSD occurrence. Microglia have been shown to express potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channels, subfamily n, member 4 (Kcnn4/Kca3.1), which could be implicated in the initiation of CSD. The role of microglial activation in CSD pathophysiology and its potential impact on systemic immunological activity are areas for further investigation.

1. Transposable elements (TES), including retroelements and DNA transposons, have long been considered as selfish and junk elements in genomes, but they have been shown to serve important functions in genetic innovation and organismal evolution.
2. Retroelements use retrotransposition to generate new copies of themselves within genomes, while DNA transposons use a cut-and-paste mechanism for transposition. Retrotransposons can be further classified into LTR retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons based on the presence or absence of long terminal repeats.
3. The gag gene of ty3/gypsy elements, a superfamily of LTR retrotransposons active in fish and amphibians but extinct in mammals, has undergone molecular domestication to form several multigenic families of genes in mammals, including mart genes.
4. Mart genes, which are derived from the gag gene of ty3/gypsy elements, encode structural proteins with three functional regions and have been shown to have important functions in placenta development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in mammals.
5. Retroviral envelope genes have also been domesticated several times independently to generate genes involved in placenta development, such as syncytins, which mediate the fusion of trophoblast cells to form the syncytiotrophoblast layer.
6. Transposase genes from diverse subfamilies of DNA transposons have been detected in vertebrates and other organisms, and many examples of genes derived from these transposases have been described, including the recombination-activating protein rag1, which catalyzes the v(d)j somatic site-specific recombination responsible for the formation and diversity of genes encoding immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors in jawed vertebrates.

1. Progressive diseases affecting 45 million people worldwide and expected to reach 76 million by 2030, are characterized by misfolding and incorrect elimination of distinct polypeptides.
2. These diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, have high societal costs and lead to a dramatic loss in life expectancy and quality of life.
3. Misfolded protein aggregates create a self-sustaining, exponential vicious circle leading to disease through their template-driven misfolding of similar proteins over time.
4. Molecular chaperones play a central role in maintaining normal cellular proteostasis by opposing protein misfolding, unfolding, and aggregation.
5. Upon cellular stress, the amounts of misfolded/unfolded proteins and/or mis-processed and mutant polypeptides increase, triggering the heat shock response and leading to imbalanced proteostasis.
6. Misfolded proteins can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function by mediating permeabilization of plasma membranes and membranous compartments, perturbing membrane protein dynamics and distribution, forming novel pathogenic signaling platforms, trapping molecular chaperones and other partner proteins within aggregates, and recruiting the soluble form of the proteins they are formed of and amplifying.
7. Recent evidence suggests that misfolded protein aggregates spread in a prion-like manner, and the transmission of misfolded protein aggregates not involving prion protein in man has been observed.

2. The study found that only patients who achieved sustained virus response (SVR) had a significant improvement in fibrosis scores (as measured by apri and fib-4) relative to other groups.
3. Patients who were not treated, who discontinued treatment, or who were nonresponsive to treatment developed hcc and newly identified cirrhosis.
4. The study confirmed that both apri and fib-4 are sensitive and specific for measuring differences in fibrosis in AA, and there was a strong correlation between the degree of fibrosis defined by biopsy and fibrosis as calculated by apri and fib-4.
5. The study found that fibrosis but not cirrhosis at the first visit was a significant risk factor for hcc. However, there was no reliable predictor on an individual basis for hcc development based on serum assays or fibrosis assays.
6. The study confirmed that AA males are at higher risk for developing hcc than AA females, but the response to therapy was similar for both genders, and achieving an SVR reduced the risk of hcc in both genders.
7. The study highlighted the importance of eliminating the virus in AA patients as the optimal goal of therapy due to the challenges in providing effective hcc surveillance in this population.

2. Beta-adrenergic receptors (2ar) have a seven membrane spanning domain structure and are receptors for neurohormones epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays a role in atherogenesis and is a potential target for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.
3. Two common non-synonymous SNPs of 2ar have been identified at nucleotides 46 (A > G) and 79 (C > G), causing amino acid changes at positions 16 (Arg > Gly) and 27 (Gln > Glu) of the fourth intracellular loop. The Gly16 variant has enhanced agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation, while the Glu27 variant is resistant to down-regulation.
4. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the association between 2ar polymorphisms and ischemic stroke using the keywords 'bar', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', and 'ischemic stroke'. Two studies were included for genotypic association meta-analysis and three studies for allelic association meta-analysis.
5. Meta-analysis results did not show a significant association between the Arg16Gly polymorphism and ischemic stroke under recessive or dominant models of inheritance or for allelic association. However, a significant association was observed between the Gln27Glu polymorphism and ischemic stroke under both recessive and dominant models of inheritance, as well as for allelic association.

1. Methadone, a frequently used drug in therapies including opioid addiction and pain management, has been reported to negatively impact human cognition and cause impaired cognitive abilities in aspects such as psychomotor performance, information processing, attention, problem solving, memory, decision making, reaction time, and emotional facial expression recognition.
2. Changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca]cyt) are involved in control of various cellular and physiological processes including neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription. However, a dramatic increase in [Ca]cyt can result in a death signal, known as delayed calcium deregulation (DCD), which may be the irreversible end point of a sequence involving mitochondrial calcium overloading.
3. In the present study, the mechanisms underlying methadone-induced rises in [Ca]cyt in sh-sy5y cells were investigated. Four different types of calcium recordings were observed: type 1 (no rise in [Ca]cyt), type 2 (continuous rise in [Ca]cyt), type 3 (deregulation with a delay), and type 4 (transient responsive cells). Methadone decreased type 4 cells and increased types 2 and 3, suggesting that methadone may induce a short or delayed calcium deregulation in sh-sy5y cells.
4. A comprehensive pharmacological survey was performed to study the possible contribution of different calcium-related mechanisms to the response to methadone. Results suggested that methadone-induced calcium deregulation is independent of opioid receptors and may be partially due to release from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular calcium stores. The role of mitochondria in methadone-induced DCD was also investigated, and it was found that drugs affecting mitochondrial handling of calcium, such as oligomycin, fccp, cgp37157, and cyclosporine a, were able to modulate methadone-induced DCD in sh-sy5y cells.

The results show that both erosive and reticular OLP lesions had significantly increased immunostaining scores of il-23p19 and the numbers of il-17+ cells compared to normal oral mucosa. In addition, erosive OLP lesions contained a significantly increased number of il-17+ cells compared to reticular OLP lesions. Il-23p19 and il-17 mRNA expressions were also significantly increased in olp lesions compared to nom tissues. These findings suggest that the il-23/il-17 axis may be involved in the local immune network of OLP.
2. The study further explores the potential role of il-23 in the production of il-17 in cd4+th cells from OLP patients. The results show that the stimulation of il-23 significantly increased the percentage of cd4+il-17+ (th17) cells and the il-17 content in the culture supernatant of cd4+th cells from OLP patients. These findings suggest that the overexpression of il-23 in OLP lesions probably contributes to the induction of th17 and the production of il-17.

1. Optic neuritis related to MS is an acute optic neuropathy that occurs in young people, especially women, and is characterized by a decline in visual acuity, eye pain, contrast sensitivity decline, dyschromatopsia, and changes in the visual field.
2. The incidence of optic neuritis as the first MS clinical presentation was the main aim of the study, along with analyzing morphometric changes in the optic nerve and visual field using OCT and computer perimetry.
3. The study was conducted at the Eye Clinic and Neurological Clinic, Sarajevo University Clinical Centre, between March 2009 and 2011.
4. The study included patients with unilateral optic neuritis and approached MS verification according to the Paty or Brakhof modern clinically defined MS (CDMS) criteria.
5. The age structure analysis showed that optic neuritis was most often present in patients aged 18 to 30 years, and was more frequent in female patients (70%).
6. The first clinical manifestation of MS in the sample was statistically significant, with optic neuritis being one of the first clinical manifestations compared to other motor, sensory, and sensory events.
7. The most frequent disturbances in the computerized visual field were centrocecal and paracentral scotomas and diffuse sensitivity.
8. Three months after the first optic neuritis presentations, the OCT analysis confirmed nerve fibre thinning in all subjects, most often in the upper quadrant.
9. All patients with MS and verified optic neuritis were treated with pulse corticosteroid therapy, and a month after treatment, visual acuity ranged from 0.6 to 1.0. Corticosteroids prevent relapse but have the same effect on visual acuity as orally administered corticosteroids.

1. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMIs) have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, and approximately 25% of them have diabetes, which is 2-3 times more prevalent than in the general population. Factors such as lower utilization of preventive care and use of newer antipsychotic medications contribute to the higher prevalence of diabetes in this population.
2. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced health home programs to provide services to reduce barriers to care for those with chronic conditions. A new behavioral health home (BHH) was created within the Division of Community Psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine to improve early recognition and provide preventative somatic care for individuals with SMIs.
3. The BHH provided a minimum of 2 services per month, coordinated by a nurse case manager, and offered care coordination, comprehensive transitional care, health promotion, and group services. A population-based health management program was created to target highly prevalent somatic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension.
4. Of the 120 patients with SMIs enrolled in the BHH, 54 (45%) did not have their hemoglobin A1c (hba1c) levels checked according to the clinic's recommended guidelines. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and another 39 were identified as having prediabetes. Preliminary data suggest that the BHH services were useful in identifying gaps in care and allowing for the delivery of preventative and individualized proactive care.
5. The data for the 33 patients with type 2 diabetes showed mixed results, with 12% (n = 4) improving to be within the recommended guidelines for hba1c levels, 21% (n = 7) showing improvements in their hba1c levels, 6% (n = 2) moving within the diabetic range, and 12% (n = 7) having higher hba1c levels compared to when they started receiving services. The BHH may provide a cost-effective way to provide patient-centered care and identify gaps in somatic care for individuals with SMIs.

1. Valerie Oppenheimer's theory emphasizes the role of men's socioeconomic position in demographic change, particularly in the declining rates of marriage and the tendency to postpone or forego marriage. Her study was influential in Europe, but some gaps remained in the empirical literature. This article aims to resolve these gaps and evaluate the theory's validity in different European countries.
2. The economic crisis in the United States and Europe, along with growing concerns about economic inequality, make the influence of men's economic position on marriage and family formation a vital concern. Oppenheimer began writing about this topic in the late 1980s when it was not a popular idea. She criticized both the ""erosion of marriage"" theory, which blamed the decline in marriage on the growing economic role of women, and the ""second demographic transition"" theory, which attributed the decline to ideological change. Oppenheimer argued that both perspectives were pessimistic about the future of marriage and failed to consider the importance of men's economic position.

1. Osteoporosis in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by a combination of factors, including reduced mechanical stress on bones, long-term glucocorticoid (GCs) treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and increased risk of falling.
2. The process of bone remodeling is disrupted in MS patients, leading to bone loss, deterioration of bone quality, and increased frequency of fractures.
3. GCs treatment is a significant risk factor for bone loss in MS patients, as it reduces calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and affects PTH secretion.
4. MS patients are at higher risk of falls due to muscle weakness, impaired balance, and gait control, which can increase the frequency of bone fractures.
5. Clinical evaluation for bone health in MS patients should include assessment of motor function using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), and laboratory tests to exclude secondary causes of osteoporosis.
6. Prevention and treatment strategies for bone loss in MS patients include weight-bearing exercise, nutrition, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological interventions such as GCs, bisphosphonates, or teriparatide.

1. miRNAs have been found to be expressed in cell type-specific manners, during specific developmental stages, and in disease states including cancer.
2. During cancer initiation and progression, miRNAs act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors.
3. Some miRNAs are overexpressed in cancers, while the majority are lost and localize to fragile sites.
4. Differences in miRNA expression profiles have been documented in normal compared to cancerous tissue of the endometrium, breast, and ovary.
5. miRNAs can affect the expression of proteins involved in pathways relevant to cancer, such as apoptosis, migration, and metastasis.
6. miRNAs hold promise as biomarkers for several types of cancer.
7. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process used by cancer cells to become more motile and metastatic, and involves reprogramming of cells by transcription factors such as ZEB1 and ZEB2.
8. miR-200c is a miRNA that represses both ZEB1 and ZEB2, as well as other mesenchymal genes, and is therefore considered to be expressed in an epithelial cell-specific manner in normal tissues.
9. ZEB1 can transcriptionally repress expression of miR-200c, creating a double negative feedback loop between miR-200c and ZEB1.

1. The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using a midurethral sling was first described by Delorme to reduce complications associated with the retropubic approach.
2. A similar transobturator passage using an inside-out approach was later described by de Leval to further reduce potential injury to the urethra and bladder.
3. A recent meta-analysis found similar cure rates between the retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator mus procedures for treating stress urinary incontinence.
4. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of both obturator approaches from a neurovascular perspective.
5. This study aimed to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approach using CT scan image analysis.
6. The study revealed that the mus tapes lie as a band posterior/dorsal to the urethra rather than inferior and that the out-in muss were more closely wrapped around the inferior ischio-pubic ramus than the in-out muss.
7. The mean full inner angle in a strict antero-posterior view formed by the in-out mus measured 122 (95%ci: 107-136) versus 144 (95%ci: 131-151) for the out-in mus (p = 0.02).
8. The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory.
9. The findings from this study demonstrate the importance of strict adherence to the prescribed operative technique and highlight the need for further research to correlate static anatomic findings with clinical outcomes.
