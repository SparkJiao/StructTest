3. In `binary_search`, since `high >= low`, we calculate `mid = (low + high) // 2 = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`.

4. At index 2, `arr[mid] = 2`, which is not equal to `x = 1`. Also, `x < arr[mid]`, so we recursively call `binary_search` with `low = 0`, `high = mid - 1 = 1`, and `x = 1`.

5. In the recursive call, `mid = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`. At index 0, `arr[mid] = 1`, which is equal to `x = 1`. Also, `mid == 0`, so the condition `(mid == 0 or x > arr[mid-1]) and (arr[mid] == x)` is satisfied. Therefore, `binary_search` returns `mid = 0`.

1. The function `string_to_tuple` takes a string `str1` as input.
2. Inside the function, a tuple comprehension is used to create a new tuple `result`.
3. The tuple comprehension iterates over each character `x` in the input string `str1`.
4. For each character `x`, it checks if `x` is not a whitespace character using the condition `not x.isspace()`.
5. If the condition is true (i.e., `x` is not a whitespace), the character `x` is included in the resulting tuple.
6. After the tuple comprehension finishes, the resulting tuple is assigned to the variable `result`.
7. The function returns the `result` tuple.

Now, let's apply the function to the given input:
- The input string is `""15.10""`.
- The tuple comprehension iterates over each character in the string:
  - `'1'` is not a whitespace, so it is included in the resulting tuple.
  - `'5'` is not a whitespace, so it is included in the resulting tuple.
  - `'.'` is not a whitespace, so it is included in the resulting tuple.
  - `'1'` is not a whitespace, so it is included in the resulting tuple.
  - `'0'` is not a whitespace, so it is included in the resulting tuple.

6. The modified string is returned as the result.

Now, let's apply the function to the given input:
- Input: `""2021-04-26""`
- The regular expression pattern matches the input string.
- The captured groups are:
  - Group 1 (year): `""2021""`
  - Group 2 (month): `""04""`
  - Group 3 (day): `""26""`
- The replacement string `'\\3-\\2-\\1'` rearranges the groups to `""26-04-2021""`.
- The function returns the modified string `""26-04-2021""`.

Now, let's evaluate the function with the given input `[6, 5, 4, 4]`:
- The list has a length of 4, so the range in the generator expressions will be from 0 to 3.
- Checking for monotonically increasing:
  - `A[0] <= A[1]`: 6 <= 5 is False
  - Since the first pair of elements doesn't satisfy the condition, the list is not monotonically increasing.
- Checking for monotonically decreasing:
  - `A[0] >= A[1]`: 6 >= 5 is True
  - `A[1] >= A[2]`: 5 >= 4 is True
  - `A[2] >= A[3]`: 4 >= 4 is True
  - All pairs of consecutive elements satisfy the condition, so the list is monotonically decreasing.
