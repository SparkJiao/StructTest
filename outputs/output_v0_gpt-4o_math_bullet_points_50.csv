- Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

## 2. Calculate the number of eggs Janet consumes daily

- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- Janet uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
- Total eggs consumed by Janet daily: 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

## 3. Calculate the number of eggs available for sale

- Subtract the number of eggs Janet consumes from the total number of eggs laid.
- Eggs available for sale: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

## 4. Determine the selling price per egg

- Each egg is sold for $2 at the farmers' market.

## 5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs

- Multiply the number of eggs available for sale by the price per egg.
- Total revenue: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

4,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Determine Total Daily Feed Requirement

- Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day.
- Wendi has 20 chickens.
- Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \).

### 2. Calculate Feed Given in the Morning

- Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning.

### 3. Calculate Feed Given in the Afternoon

- Wendi gives her chickens 25 cups of feed in the afternoon.

### 4. Calculate Total Feed Given Before Final Meal

- The total feed given before the final meal is \( 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \).

### 5. Determine Remaining Feed Needed for the Day

- The total daily feed requirement is 60 cups.
- Wendi has already given 40 cups.
- Therefore, the remaining feed needed for the final meal is \( 60 \text{ cups (total)} - 40 \text{ cups (already given)} = 20 \text{ cups} \).

- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

**Step 2** Determine the time spent in standstill traffic on the return trip.

- John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
- During this time, he does not cover any distance.

**Step 3** Calculate the distance John travels in the next half-hour at 30 mph.

- John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

**Step 4** Calculate the remaining time John has to drive after the standstill and half-hour drive.

- Total return trip time is 4 hours.
- Time spent in standstill traffic and driving at 30 mph = 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
- Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

**Step 5** Calculate the distance John travels in the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph.

**Step 2**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house.

- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \).

**Step 3**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the green house.

- After selling a third at the green house, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 4**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house.

- Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.

**Step 5**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the red house.

- After selling 2 more at the red house, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

**Step 6**: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house.

- She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

**Step 7**: Determine the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after the orange house.

- After selling half at the orange house, she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) remaining, which equals 5 vacuum cleaners.

**Step 8**: Set up the equation and solve for \( x \).

- We have the equation: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
  \]

- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

- Add 2 to both sides:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{3} = 12

- Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
  \[
  2x = 36

### 2. Set up the equation for their total age

- According to the problem, the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.
- Therefore, the equation is:

### 3. Simplify the equation

- Combine like terms:

### 4. Solve for \(x\)

- Divide both sides by 18 to find \(x\):

### 1. Calculate Remaining Calorie Allowance

- You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Therefore, your remaining calorie allowance is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

### 2. Determine Calories per Gram of Chips

- The bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving contains 250 calories.
- Therefore, the entire bag contains \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
- The bag weighs 300 grams.
- Thus, the calories per gram of chips is \(\frac{1250}{300}\).

### 3. Calculate Calories per Gram

- \(\frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.1667\) calories per gram.

### 4. Determine How Many Grams You Can Eat

### 1

First, convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, multiply the number of feet by 12 to get the total length in inches.

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

### 2

Next, determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire. This is done by dividing the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece.

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

### 3

Verify the calculation to ensure accuracy. Multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece to check if it equals the total length of the wire.
