1. The function `remove_Occ` is called with `s = ""PHP""` and `ch = ""P""`.
2. We start the first loop to find the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`:
   - For `i = 0`, `s[0]` is `""P""` which matches `ch`. 
   - We remove this character by updating `s` to `s[0:0] + s[1:]`, which results in `s = ""HP""`.
   - The first loop breaks after this operation.
3. Now, we start the second loop to find the last occurrence of `ch` in the updated `s`:
   - The length of `s` is now 2, so we iterate from `i = 1` to `i = 0`.
   - For `i = 1`, `s[1]` is `""P""` which does not match `ch`.
   - For `i = 0`, `s[0]` is `""H""` which does not match `ch`.
   - Since there are no more occurrences of `ch` in `s`, the second loop completes without making any changes.
4. Finally, the function returns the modified string `s`, which is `""HP""`.

1. **Input Matrix**:

   my_matrix = [[7, 12, 1, 14], 
                [2, 13, 8, 11], 
                [16, 3, 10, 5], 
                [9, 6, 15, 4]]
   ```

2. **Determine Size of Matrix**:
   - `iSize = len(my_matrix[0])` results in `iSize = 4`.

3. **Initialize `sum_list`**:
   - `sum_list` is initialized as an empty list.
   - We extend `sum_list` with the sums of each row:
     - Row 1: `7 + 12 + 1 + 14 = 34`
     - Row 2: `2 + 13 + 8 + 11 = 34`
     - Row 3: `16 + 3 + 10 + 5 = 34`
     - Row 4: `9 + 6 + 15 + 4 = 34`
   - After this step, `sum_list = [34, 34, 34, 34]`.

4. **Calculate Column Sums**:
   - For each column, we calculate the sum and append it to `sum_list`:
     - Column 1: `7 + 2 + 16 + 9 = 34`
     - Column 2: `12 + 13 + 3 + 6 = 34`
     - Column 3: `1 + 8 + 10 + 15 = 34`
     - Column 4: `14 + 11 + 5 + 4 = 34`
   - After this step, `sum_list = [34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34]`.

5. **Calculate Diagonal Sums**:
   - Calculate the sum of the main diagonal:
     - `7 + 13 + 10 + 4 = 34`
   - Append this to `sum_list`: `sum_list = [34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34]`.
   - Calculate the sum of the secondary diagonal:
     - `14 + 8 + 3 + 9 = 34`

6. **Check for Unique Sums**:
   - We check if all sums in `sum_list` are the same by converting it to a set and checking its length:
   - `len(set(sum_list))` results in `1` since all sums are `34`.

### Step-by-step Execution

1. **Input Matrix**: `my_matrix = [[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 7]]`
2. **Determine Size**: 
   - `iSize = len(my_matrix[0])` which gives `iSize = 3` (the number of columns).
3. **Initialize `sum_list`**: 
   - `sum_list = []`
4. **Calculate Row Sums**: 
   - For each row in `my_matrix`, calculate the sum:
     - Row 1: `2 + 7 + 6 = 15`
     - Row 2: `9 + 5 + 1 = 15`
     - Row 3: `4 + 3 + 7 = 14`
   - After this step, `sum_list` becomes: `sum_list = [15, 15, 14]`
5. **Calculate Column Sums**: 
   - For each column in `my_matrix`, calculate the sum:
     - Column 1: `2 + 9 + 4 = 15`
     - Column 2: `7 + 5 + 3 = 15`
     - Column 3: `6 + 1 + 7 = 14`
   - After this step, `sum_list` becomes: `sum_list = [15, 15, 14, 15, 15, 14]`
6. **Calculate Main Diagonal Sum**: 
   - For the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
     - `2 + 5 + 7 = 14`
   - Append this to `sum_list`: `sum_list = [15, 15, 14, 15, 15, 14, 14]`
7. **Calculate Anti-Diagonal Sum**: 
   - For the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
     - `6 + 5 + 4 = 15`
   - Append this to `sum_list`: `sum_list = [15, 15, 14, 15, 15, 14, 14, 15]`
8. **Check for Unique Sums**: 
   - Convert `sum_list` to a set to check for unique sums: `set(sum_list) = {14, 15}`
   - Since the length of the set is greater than 1 (`len(set(sum_list)) > 1`), it indicates that not all sums are equal.
9. **Return Result**: 
   - The function returns `False`.

   - Next, calculate `1 << (l - 1)` which is `1 << 3 = 8`. Thus, `1 << (l - 1) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7`.
   - Now, we compute `num = 63 ^ 7`. In binary, `63` is `111111` and `7` is `000111`. The XOR operation gives us:
     ```
     111111
     000111
     ------
     111000 (which is 56 in decimal)
     ```
   - Therefore, `num = 56`.

3. Next, we calculate `new_num` using the expression `n & num`:
   - We have `n = 39` which is `100111` in binary.
   - We already calculated `num = 56` which is `111000` in binary.
   - Now, we perform the AND operation:
     ```
     100111
     111000
     ------
     100000 (which is 32 in decimal)
     ```
   - Thus, `new_num = 32`.

4. We then check if `new_num == 0`:
   - Since `new_num = 32`, this condition is false.

5. Finally, we return `False` because the condition `new_num == 0` was not met.

   - For `i = 1`: 
     - `j = 0`: `arr[1] (60) < arr[0] (80)`, no update.

  - `16 > 3`: Update `MSIBS[3] = 5 + 16 = 21`.

Final `MSIBS = [2, 5, 19, 35, 56, 79, 108, 138]`.

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Decreasing Subsequence Sum (MSDBS)
Create a copy of `arr` called `MSDBS`, so `MSDBS = [2, 3, 14, 16, 21, 23, 29, 30]`.
We will iterate through `arr` in reverse to fill `MSDBS`:
- For `i = 1`: Compare `arr[-1] (30)` with `arr[-2] (29)`. No update since `30` is not less than `29`.
- For `i = 2`: Compare `arr[-2] (29)` with `arr[-3] (23)`. Update `MSDBS[-2] = 29 + 23 = 52`.
- For `i = 3`: Compare `arr[-3] (23)` with `arr[-4] (21)`. Update `MSDBS[-3] = 23 + 21 = 44`.
- For `i = 4`: Compare `arr[-4] (21)` with `arr[-5] (16)`. Update `MSDBS[-4] = 21 + 16 = 37`.
- For `i = 5`: Compare `arr[-5] (16)` with `arr[-6] (14)`. Update `MSDBS[-5] = 16 + 14 = 30`.
- For `i = 6`: Compare `arr[-6] (14)` with `arr[-7] (3)`. Update `MSDBS[-6] = 14 + 3 = 17`.
- For `i = 7`: Compare `arr[-7] (3)` with `arr[-8] (2)`. Update `MSDBS[-7] = 3 + 2 = 5`.

Final `MSDBS = [2, 3, 14, 16, 21, 23, 29, 30]`.

### Step 4: Calculate Maximum Sum
Initialize `max_sum` to negative infinity.
Iterate through `zip(MSIBS, MSDBS, arr)`:
- For `i = 2, j = 2, k = 2`: `max_sum = max(-inf, 2 + 2 - 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 5, j = 3, k = 3`: `max_sum = max(2, 5 + 3 - 3) = 5`.
- For `i = 19, j = 14, k = 14`: `max_sum = max(5, 19 + 14 - 14) = 19`.
- For `i = 35, j = 16, k = 16`: `max_sum = max(19, 35 + 16 - 16) = 35`.
- For `i = 56, j = 21, k = 21`: `max_sum = max(35, 56 + 21 - 21) = 56`.
- For `i = 79, j = 23, k = 23`: `max_sum = max(56, 79 + 23 - 23) = 79`.
- For `i = 108, j = 29, k = 29`: `max_sum = max(79, 108 + 29 - 29) = 108`.
- For `i = 138, j = 30, k = 30`: `max_sum = max(108, 138 + 30 - 30) = 138`.

### Final Result
The final result of the function is `max_sum = 138`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The length of the string `n` is calculated: `n = 17`.
   - A 2D list `L` of size `n x n` is initialized with all values set to `0`.

2. **Setting up the diagonal**:
   - For each character in the string, we set `L[i][i] = 1` because every single character is a palindrome of length 1.
   - After this loop, `L` will have `1`s on the diagonal:

3. **Building the table**:
   - We start checking for palindromes of length 2 to `n` (from `cl = 2` to `cl = 17`).
   - For each length `cl`, we check all substrings of that length:

         - `i = 15, j = 16`: `S` vs `S` → `L[15][16] = 2`
     - For `cl = 3`:
       - Check triplets:
         - `i = 0, j = 2`: `C` vs `R` → `L[0][2] = 0`
         - `i = 1, j = 3`: `A` vs `D` → `L[1][3] = 0`
         - ...
         - `i = 15, j = 17`: `S` vs `S` → `L[15][16] = 2`
     - Continue this process for lengths up to `n`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After filling the table, we find that `L[0][16]` contains the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
   - The final value in `L[0][16]` is `5`, which corresponds to the longest palindromic subsequence found in the string.

5. Start filling the table for substrings of length `2` to `30`:
   - For `cl = 2` (substrings of length 2):
     - Check pairs of characters:
       - `L[0][1]` (P, A) → not equal, so `L[0][1] = max(L[0][0], L[1][1]) = 1`
       - `L[1][2]` (A, R) → not equal, so `L[1][2] = max(L[1][1], L[2][2]) = 1`
       - ...
       - Continue this for all pairs.
   - For `cl = 3` (substrings of length 3):
     - Check triplets of characters:
       - `L[0][2]` (P, R) → not equal, so `L[0][2] = max(L[0][1], L[1][2]) = 1`
       - ...
   - Continue this process for increasing lengths of substrings up to `cl = 30`.

6. Eventually, we will find that the longest palindromic subsequence is formed by the characters ""PART"", which appears at the beginning and the end of the string. The length of this palindromic subsequence is `8`.

7. The final value in `L[0][29]` will be `8`, which represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

   - Start the inner loop to check for factors from 2 to 3. The first check is with 2. Since 4 is divisible by 2, we break out of the inner loop and do not increment `ctr`.
8. For `num = 5`:
   - Start the inner loop to check for factors from 2 to 4. The first check is with 2. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, we check 3 next. Since 5 is not divisible by 3, we reach the `else` clause and increment `ctr` by 1. Now, `ctr = 3`.
9. For `num = 6`:
   - Start the inner loop to check for factors from 2 to 5. The first check is with 2. Since 6 is divisible by 2, we break out of the inner loop and do not increment `ctr`.
10. For `num = 7`:
    - Start the inner loop to check for factors from 2 to 6. The first check is with 2. Since 7 is not divisible by 2, we check 3 next. Since 7 is not divisible by 3, we check 4 and 5, and since 7 is not divisible by any of them, we reach the `else` clause and increment `ctr` by 1. Now, `ctr = 4`.
11. For `num = 8`:
    - Start the inner loop to check for factors from 2 to 7. The first check is with 2. Since 8 is divisible by 2, we break out of the inner loop and do not increment `ctr`.
12. For `num = 9`:
    - Start the inner loop to check for factors from 2 to 8. The first check is with 2. Since 9 is not divisible by 2, we check 3 next. Since 9 is divisible by 3, we break out of the inner loop and do not increment `ctr`.
13. The loop ends as we have checked all numbers from 0 to 9.

Finally, we return `ctr`, which is 4.

1. Initialize `ctr` to `0`. This variable will count the number of prime numbers found.
2. Start iterating over `num` from `0` to `99` (since the range is exclusive of `n`).
3. For each `num`, check if it is less than or equal to `1`. If it is, continue to the next iteration (skip to the next number).
4. For `num` values greater than `1`, start a nested loop with `i` ranging from `2` to `num - 1` to check for factors.
5. If `num` is divisible by any `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), break out of the inner loop, indicating that `num` is not prime.
6. If the inner loop completes without breaking (meaning no divisors were found), increment `ctr` by `1`, indicating that `num` is a prime number.
7. Continue this process until all numbers from `0` to `99` have been checked.
8. Finally, return the value of `ctr`, which represents the total count of prime numbers found.

   - The function is called with `n = 4`.
   - Again, `n` is neither `0` nor `1`, so we calculate `2 * newman_prime(3) + newman_prime(2)`.

4. Now we calculate `newman_prime(3)`:
   - The function is called with `n = 3`.
   - Since `n` is neither `0` nor `1`, we calculate `2 * newman_prime(2) + newman_prime(1)`.

5. Next, we calculate `newman_prime(2)`:
   - The function is called with `n = 2`.
   - Since `n` is neither `0` nor `1`, we calculate `2 * newman_prime(1) + newman_prime(0)`.

6. Now we calculate `newman_prime(1)`:
   - The function is called with `n = 1`.
   - Since `n` is `1`, we return `1`.

7. Next, we calculate `newman_prime(0)`:
   - The function is called with `n = 0`.
   - Since `n` is `0`, we return `1`.

8. Now we can compute `newman_prime(2)`:
   - We have `newman_prime(1) = 1` and `newman_prime(0) = 1`.
   - Thus, `newman_prime(2) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

9. Now we can compute `newman_prime(3)`:
   - We have `newman_prime(2) = 3` and `newman_prime(1) = 1`.
   - Thus, `newman_prime(3) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`.

10. Now we can compute `newman_prime(4)`:
    - We have `newman_prime(3) = 7` and `newman_prime(2) = 3`.
    - Thus, `newman_prime(4) = 2 * 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17`.

11. Finally, we can compute `newman_prime(5)`:
    - We have `newman_prime(4) = 17` and `newman_prime(3) = 7`.
    - Thus, `newman_prime(5) = 2 * 17 + 7 = 34 + 7 = 41`.

1. Initialize `inv_count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of inversions in the array.
2. Start the first loop with `i = 0` (the first element, which is `1`):
   - Start the second loop with `j = 1` (the second element, which is `20`):
     - Since `1` is not greater than `20`, no inversion is counted.

   - Next, with `j = 3` (the fourth element, which is `4`):

     - Since `20` is greater than `6`, we have an inversion. Increment `inv_count` to `1`.
   - Next, with `j = 3` (the fourth element, which is `4`):
     - Since `20` is greater than `4`, we have another inversion. Increment `inv_count` to `2`.
   - Next, with `j = 4` (the fifth element, which is `5`):

### Code snippet

```python
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
  tuplex_colon = deepcopy(tuplex)
  tuplex_colon[m].append(n)
  return tuplex_colon
```

### Inputs

```
(""HELLO"", 5, [], True) ,2,50
```

### Execution Steps

1. **Input Breakdown**: The input consists of a tuple `(""HELLO"", 5, [], True)` and two additional parameters `m = 2` and `n = 50`.

2. **Deep Copy**: The function starts by creating a deep copy of the input tuple. Since tuples are immutable in Python, we cannot modify them directly. However, the function attempts to treat the tuple as if it were mutable by copying it.

3. **Accessing the Tuple**: The function tries to access the element at index `m` (which is `2`) of the copied tuple `tuplex_colon`. The original tuple is `(""HELLO"", 5, [], True)`, so:
   - `tuplex_colon[2]` refers to the third element of the tuple, which is an empty list `[]`.

4. **Appending to the List**: The function then attempts to append `n` (which is `50`) to the list at index `2`:
   - `tuplex_colon[2].append(50)` modifies the list from `[]` to `[50]`.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the modified tuple. The modified tuple will be:
   - `(""HELLO"", 5, [50], True)`

2. **Deep Copy**: The function starts by creating a deep copy of the input tuple. Since tuples are immutable in Python, we cannot modify them directly. However, the function attempts to treat the tuple as a list by accessing its elements.

3. **Accessing Elements**: The function tries to access the element at index `m` (which is `2`) of the tuple. The tuple is `(""HELLO"", 5, [], True)`, so:
   - `tuplex[0]` is `""HELLO""`
   - `tuplex[1]` is `5`
   - `tuplex[2]` is `[]` (an empty list)
   - `tuplex[3]` is `True`

4. **Appending to List**: The function then attempts to append `n` (which is `100`) to the list at index `2` of the copied tuple. Since `tuplex_colon[2]` is an empty list `[]`, appending `100` will result in `tuplex_colon[2]` becoming `[100]`.

5. **Final Result**: The modified tuple will be:
   - `tuplex_colon[0]` remains `""HELLO""`
   - `tuplex_colon[1]` remains `5`
   - `tuplex_colon[2]` becomes `[100]`
   - `tuplex_colon[3]` remains `True`

Thus, the final modified tuple will be:
```python

1. The function `convert_list_dictionary` takes three lists as input: `l1`, `l2`, and `l3`.
2. The input lists are:
   - `l1 = [""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi"", ""jkl""]`
   - `l2 = [""python"", ""program"", ""language"", ""programs""]`
   - `l3 = [100, 200, 300, 400]`
3. The function uses a list comprehension combined with the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the three lists simultaneously.
4. The `zip` function pairs the elements from the three lists:
   - First iteration: `x = ""abc""`, `y = ""python""`, `z = 100`
   - Second iteration: `x = ""def""`, `y = ""program""`, `z = 200`
   - Third iteration: `x = ""ghi""`, `y = ""language""`, `z = 300`
   - Fourth iteration: `x = ""jkl""`, `y = ""programs""`, `z = 400`
5. For each triplet `(x, y, z)`, a dictionary is created in the format `{x: {y: z}}`.

- The second part `^([a-z]).*\1$` checks for a repeating character. Here, the first character `a` is captured by `([a-z])`, and `.*` allows for any characters in between. The `\1` refers back to the captured character, which is `a`. Since `a` appears again in the string `""abba""`, this part matches.

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start with `nums1 = [1, 3, 7]`, `nums2 = [2, 4, 6]`, and `k = 1`.
   - We initialize an empty priority queue `queue = []`.
   - We define the helper function `push(i, j)` which will push the sum of the elements from `nums1` and `nums2` at indices `i` and `j` into the queue.

2. **First Push**:
   - We call `push(0, 0)`, which corresponds to `nums1[0] + nums2[0] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
   - We push `[3, 0, 0]` into the queue. Now, `queue = [[3, 0, 0]]`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - We initialize an empty list `pairs = []`.
   - We enter the while loop since `queue` is not empty and `len(pairs) < k` (0 < 1).

4. **First Pop**:
   - We pop the smallest element from the queue: `_, i, j = heapq.heappop(queue)`, which gives us `3, 0, 0`.
   - We append the pair `[nums1[0], nums2[0]] = [1, 2]` to `pairs`. Now, `pairs = [[1, 2]]`.

5. **Push Next Pair**:
   - We call `push(i, j + 1)` which is `push(0, 1)`. This corresponds to `nums1[0] + nums2[1] = 1 + 4 = 5`.
   - We push `[5, 0, 1]` into the queue. Now, `queue = [[5, 0, 1]]`.

6. **Push New Row**:

1. The function `round_and_sum` is called with the input list: `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]`.

2. The length of the list is calculated:
   - `length = len(list1)` results in `length = 9`.

3. The function then attempts to compute `round_and_sum` using the expression `sum(list(map(round, list1)) * length)`. 
   - First, we apply the `round` function to each element in `list1`:
     - `round(22.4)` results in `22`
     - `round(4.0)` results in `4`
     - `round(-16.22)` results in `-16`

     - `round(-5.20)` results in `-5`

   - The rounded list is: `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`.

4. Next, we multiply this rounded list by `length` (which is `9`):
   - This results in a new list: `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18, 22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18, 22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18, 22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18, 22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18, 22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`.

5. Now, we compute the sum of this new list:
   - The sum is calculated as follows:
     - `22 + 4 - 16 - 9 + 11 - 12 + 14 - 5 + 18` results in `22 + 4 = 26`

3. Round each element in `list1`:
   - `map(round, list1)` applies the `round` function to each element:

   - The rounded values are `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`.
4. Multiply the list of rounded values by `length`:

   Thus, the rounded list is `[25, 57, 89]`.

3. The function uses a nested tuple comprehension to multiply corresponding elements of the tuples from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.

Now, let's break down the multiplication step by step:

- For the first pair of tuples: `(3, 5)` and `(8, 9)`
  - Multiply: `3 * 8 = 24`
  - Multiply: `5 * 9 = 45`
  - Resulting tuple: `(24, 45)`

- For the second pair of tuples: `(6, 7)` and `(5, 11)`
  - Multiply: `6 * 5 = 30`
  - Multiply: `7 * 11 = 77`
  - Resulting tuple: `(30, 77)`

- For the third pair of tuples: `(4, 11)` and `(3, 3)`
  - Multiply: `4 * 3 = 12`
  - Multiply: `11 * 3 = 33`
  - Resulting tuple: `(12, 33)`

- For the fourth pair of tuples: `(3, 12)` and `(9, 5)`
  - Multiply: `3 * 9 = 27`
  - Multiply: `12 * 5 = 60`
  - Resulting tuple: `(27, 60)`

4. Now we combine all the resulting tuples into a final result:
   - Final result: `((24, 45), (30, 77), (12, 33), (27, 60))`

5. The function returns this result as a tuple.

3. Inside the loop, we have the line `x = len([i for i in range(1,n+1) if not n % i])`. This line creates a list of all divisors of `n` (which is `15`).
4. The list comprehension `[i for i in range(1,n+1) if not n % i]` iterates over the range from `1` to `15` (inclusive) and checks if `15` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
5. The divisors of `15` are `1`, `3`, `5`, and `15`. Therefore, the list comprehension will produce the list `[1, 3, 5, 15]`.
6. The length of this list is `4`, so `x` is assigned the value `4`.
7. The for loop continues to iterate, but `x` will remain `4` for each iteration since it is reassigned in every iteration but does not change.
8. After completing all iterations, the function returns `x`, which is `4`.

3. Inside the loop, we have the line `x = len([i for i in range(1,n+1) if not n % i])`. This line creates a list of all divisors of `n` (which is `12` in this case).

5. The divisors of `12` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`. Therefore, the list comprehension will produce the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`.

1. The function `divisor` is called with `n = 9`.
2. We enter the for loop with `for i in range(n)`, which means `i` will take values from `0` to `8` (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, for each value of `i`, we calculate `x` as the length of a list comprehension that finds all divisors of `n` (which is `9`).
4. The list comprehension `[i for i in range(1, n+1) if not n % i]` generates a list of numbers from `1` to `9` that divide `9` evenly (i.e., where `n % i == 0`).
5. Let's evaluate the list comprehension:
   - For `i = 1`: `9 % 1 == 0` → include `1`
   - For `i = 2`: `9 % 2 != 0` → do not include `2`
   - For `i = 3`: `9 % 3 == 0` → include `3`
   - For `i = 4`: `9 % 4 != 0` → do not include `4`
   - For `i = 5`: `9 % 5 != 0` → do not include `5`
   - For `i = 6`: `9 % 6 != 0` → do not include `6`
   - For `i = 7`: `9 % 7 != 0` → do not include `7`
   - For `i = 8`: `9 % 8 != 0` → do not include `8`
   - For `i = 9`: `9 % 9 == 0` → include `9`
6. The resulting list of divisors is `[1, 3, 9]`.
7. The length of this list is `3`, so `x` is set to `3` for each iteration of the loop.
8. The loop runs `9` times, but `x` will always be `3` after the first iteration since it does not depend on `i`.
9. After the loop completes, the function returns `x`, which is `3`.
