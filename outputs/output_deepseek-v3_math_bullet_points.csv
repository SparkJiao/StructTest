1. **Calculate the total daily feed required per chicken:**
   - Each chicken is fed 3 cups of feed per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily feed required for the entire flock:**
   - Total feed per day = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken
   - Total feed per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups = 60 cups

3. **Calculate the total feed already given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning feed = 15 cups
   - Afternoon feed = 25 cups
   - Total feed given so far = 15 + 25 = 40 cups

4. **Determine the remaining feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Remaining feed = Total daily feed - Feed already given
   - Remaining feed = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

- John has 13 lego sets.
- He sells each lego set for $15.
- Total money earned = 13 * $15 = $195.

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the video games John buys.
- John buys 8 video games.
- Each video game costs $20.
- Total cost of video games = 8 * $20 = $160.

**Step 3** Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games.
- Total money earned from selling lego sets = $195.
- Total cost of video games = $160.
- Money left = $195 - $160 = $35.

**Step 4** Compare the money left with the given information.
- The problem states that John has $5 left.
- However, our calculation shows $35 left.
- This discrepancy suggests that John did not sell all 13 lego sets.

**Step 5** Calculate how many lego sets John actually sold.
- Let the number of lego sets sold be \( x \).
- Money earned from selling \( x \) lego sets = \( x * $15 \).
- Money spent on video games = $160.
- Money left = $5.
- So, \( x * $15 - $160 = $5 \).
- Solving for \( x \): \( x = \frac{$160 + $5}{$15} = \frac{$165}{$15} = 11 \).

**Step 6** Determine how many lego sets John still has.
- Total lego sets John originally had = 13.

- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- There are two cats for every dog, so \( C = 2D \).
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( R = (D + C) - 12 \).

- Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made **32 ounces** of sauce.
- When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose **half their volume**.
- This means the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was **twice** the final sauce volume.

### 2
- Original volume of tomatoes = **2 × 32 ounces = 64 ounces**.

### 3
- Each **16-ounce can** of tomatoes contains **3 tomatoes**.
- To find the number of cans used, divide the original volume by the volume per can:  
  **64 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/can = 4 cans**.

### 4
- Since each can contains **3 tomatoes**, the total number of tomatoes used is:  
  **4 cans × 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes**.

- Total cost of tickets = $20.25.

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the food.
- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
- Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50 = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the rides.
- They went on 2 rides, each costing $33.
- Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.

**Step 4** Calculate the total cost of all expenses.
- Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides.
- Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

**Step 5** Calculate the amount each friend pays by splitting the total cost evenly.
- There are 3 friends.
- Amount each friend pays = Total cost / 3 = $102 / 3 = $34.

- She will take a 6th test.
- The lowest score will be removed from the average.
- The goal is to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

**Step 2** Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- The scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
- The lowest score is 71.

**Step 3** Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93:
- Since the lowest score is removed, only the top 5 scores will be averaged.
- To achieve an average of 93 over 5 tests, the total points needed are:  
  \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).

**Step 4** Calculate the current total of the top 5 scores:
- The current scores are: 89, 92, 100, 86, and the 6th test score (let's call it \( x \)).
- The lowest score (71) is removed, so the total of the top 5 scores is:

**Step 5** Set up the equation to solve for \( x \):

**Step 1** Define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool (in gallons).
- Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool (in gallons).

**Step 2** Understand the leaks:
- Both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

**Step 3** Express the amounts 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

**Step 4** Set up the equation for 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
  \[
  B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
  \]

**Step 5** Set up the equation for the current situation:
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
  \[
  B = 4S
  \]

**Step 6** Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

**Step 7** Solve for \( S \):
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
4S - 2S = 32 - 16
\]
\[
2S = 16
\]
\[
S = 8
\]

**Step 8** Verify the solution:
- Current small pool: \( S = 8 \) gallons.
- Current big pool: \( B = 4S = 32 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, small pool: \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, big pool: \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons.
- Check if 48 is twice 24: \( 48 = 2 \times 24 \) (True).
- Check if 32 is four times 8: \( 32 = 4 \times 8 \) (True).

### 1. Define Variables
- Let Sam's current age be \( S \).
- Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

### 2. Set Up the Equation for the Future
- In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).
- According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:  
  \( 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

### 3. Solve the Equation
- Expand the equation:  
  \( 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \).
- Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:  
  \( 3S + 9 = 27 \).
- Subtract 9 from both sides:  
  \( 3S = 18 \).
- Divide both sides by 3:  
  \( S = 6 \).

### 4. Verify the Solution
- Sam's current age is 6.
- Ruby's current age is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \).
- In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \).
- In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \).
- Check if Ruby's age is 3 times Sam's age in 9 years:

  Each blouse costs $20.

### 2
- **Calculate the discount amount per blouse:**  
  The discount is 30%, so the discount per blouse is:  
  \( 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \)  
  Each blouse is discounted by $6.

### 3
- **Determine the discounted price per blouse:**  
  Subtract the discount from the regular price:  
  \( 20 - 6 = 14 \)  
  Each blouse costs $14 after the discount.

Let’s define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30, which is 15 apples, from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers \( A \) apples from the average trees.

### 2
Now, let’s calculate the number of apples Joanne’s sister gathers:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

### 3
Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne:
\[
30 \, (\text{tallest}) + 15 \, (\text{shortest}) + A \, (\text{average}) = 45 + A
\]

### 4
Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne’s sister:
\[

### 5
The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[

- The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
- 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

**Step 2** Determine the amount of hay the horse consumes.
- The horse eats 1/2 a bale of hay per mile.
- Total hay consumed = 16 miles × 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales.

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the hay.
- Each bale costs $3.
- Total cost = 8 bales × $3/bale = $24.

**Step 4** Determine how much money Michael has.
- Michael has six $5 bills.
- Total money = 6 × $5 = $30.

**Step 5** Calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay.
- Change = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6.

- Super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie, popcorn, and soda for an extra $1.
- Regular ticket costs $12, and popcorn and soda are bought separately.
- Soda costs $3.
- By not buying the super ticket, you saved $2.

**Step 2** Calculate the total cost of the super ticket option:
- Super ticket: $20 + $1 (for popcorn and soda) = $21.

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the regular ticket option:
- Regular ticket: $12.
- Soda: $3.
- Popcorn: Let’s denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).
- Total cost: \( 12 + 3 + P = 15 + P \).

**Step 4** Determine the savings:
- By not buying the super ticket, you saved $2.
- This means the regular ticket option costs $2 less than the super ticket option.

- Let the cost of the lot be \( x \).
- According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3x \).

### 2
- The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
- Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is:
  \[
  x + 3x = 120,000
  \]

### 3
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  4x = 120,000
  \]

### 4
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000

- So, the cost of the lot is $30,000.

### 5
- The cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot:

1. **Define Variables**  
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - In the second half, he saves twice as much daily, so he saves \( 2x \) each day.

2. **Calculate the Number of Days**  
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

3. **Set Up the Equation**  
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \).
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
   - Total savings for the month: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \)**  
   - Elvis's monthly target is $1125, so:

   - Divide both sides by 45:
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25

### 1. Understand the given information
- James's play set has **80 toys**.
- Jonathan needs **2 more toys** than he currently has to make his play set **five times larger** than James's.

### 2. Define the variables
- Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
- Jonathan needs **2 more toys**, so he will have \( x + 2 \) toys after acquiring them.

### 3. Set up the equation
- Jonathan's play set needs to be **five times larger** than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys, so five times larger is \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \) toys.
- Therefore, \( x + 2 = 400 \).

### 4. Solve for \( x \)
- Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: \( x = 400 - 2 \).
- Simplify: \( x = 398 \).

### 5. Verify the solution
- Jonathan currently has **398 toys**.
- After adding 2 more toys, he will have \( 398 + 2 = 400 \) toys.
- This is indeed five times larger than James's play set (80 toys).

- Day 1 and 2: 50 birds total
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and 5: 120 birds total
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

**Step 3** Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days:
- Total birds = 50 (Day 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4 and 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7)
- Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

**Step 4** Calculate the average number of birds per day:
- Average = Total birds / Number of days
- Average = 280 / 7 = 40 birds per day

**Step 5** Final result: Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day.

### 1. Define the starting value
- The starting value is given as **20**.

### 2. Calculate half the starting value
- Half of the starting value is:  
  \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

### 3. Add the starting value and half the starting value
- The sum is:  
  \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

### 4. Divide the sum by 5
- The result is:  
  \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

### 5. Subtract 12 from the starting value
- The result is:  
  \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).

### 6. Multiply the two results
- The final value is:  
  \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

**1. Identify the given information:**
   - Set temperature: 450°F
   - Actual temperature: 468°F
   - Recipe temperature: 520°F

**2. Calculate the percentage error:**
   - The oven is running hotter than set by \( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \times 100\% = 4\% \).

**3. Apply the same percentage error to the recipe temperature:**
   - Since the oven runs 4% hotter, the actual temperature will be 104% of the set temperature.

**4. Set up the equation to find the required set temperature:**
   - Let \( x \) be the set temperature for the recipe.
   - \( 1.04x = 520 \).

**5. Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{520}{1.04} \).

1. **Calculate the cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits: \( 10 \times 750 = 7500 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost per dress pant: \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for dress pants: \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the number of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - Total number of dress shirts: \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the dress shirts:**
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts: \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Add the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
   - Total cost: \( 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \) dollars.

# 1. Define the variables
- Let \( s \) represent the number of sheep.
- Let \( g \) represent the number of geese.

# 2. Set up the equations
- Each sheep has 1 head and 4 legs.
- Each goose has 1 head and 2 legs.
- The total number of heads is 20: \( s + g = 20 \).
- The total number of legs is 70: \( 4s + 2g = 70 \).

# 3. Simplify the equations
- From the first equation, express \( g \) in terms of \( s \): \( g = 20 - s \).
- Substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the second equation: \( 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \).

# 4. Solve for \( s \)
- Expand the equation: \( 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \).
- Combine like terms: \( 2s + 40 = 70 \).
- Subtract 40 from both sides: \( 2s = 30 \).
- Divide by 2: \( s = 15 \).

# 5. Verify the solution
- If \( s = 15 \), then \( g = 20 - 15 = 5 \).
- Check the total number of legs: \( 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \), which matches the given condition.

- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

**Step 2** Use the given information to set up equations:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \).

**Step 3** Solve for Max's cookies:
- From \( K = M - 5 \) and \( K = 68 \), we get \( 68 = M - 5 \).
- Solving for \( M \): \( M = 68 + 5 = 73 \).

**Step 4** Solve for the Cookie Monster's cookies:
- From \( M = C + 12 \) and \( M = 73 \), we get \( 73 = C + 12 \).

### 1. Define the variables
- Let **S** represent the number of marbles Sean has.
- Let **C** represent the number of marbles Carl has.
- Let **K** represent the number of marbles Cal has.

### 2. Assign the known value
- Sean has 56 marbles:  
  \( S = 56 \).

### 3. Relate Sean's marbles to Cal's marbles
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal:  
  \( S = \frac{1}{2}K \).  
  Substituting \( S = 56 \):  
  \( 56 = \frac{1}{2}K \).  
  Solving for \( K \):  
  \( K = 112 \).

### 4. Relate Carl's marbles to Sean's marbles
- Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:  
  \( C = 4S \).  
  Substituting \( S = 56 \):  
  \( C = 4 \times 56 = 224 \).

### 5. Calculate the combined marbles of Carl and Cal
- Carl has 224 marbles, and Cal has 112 marbles.  
  Combined:  
  \( C + K = 224 + 112 = 336 \).

- **Calculation**: Subtract the number of available students from the total number of students needed.
- **Result**: \( 108 - 54 = 54 \) more students needed.

### 1. Initial Stickers
- Lorraine starts with:
  - 30 small stickers
  - 40 large stickers

### 2. Trading Small Stickers
- She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
  - 90% of 30 small stickers = 27 small stickers.
  - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, but she trades them for large buttons.
  - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers.
  - So, 27 small stickers ÷ 3 = 9 large buttons.

### 3. Remaining Small Stickers
- After trading, she has:
  - 30 small stickers - 27 small stickers = 3 small stickers.

### 4. Trading Large Stickers
- She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
  - 50% of 40 large stickers = 20 large stickers.
  - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons.
  - She trades them for large buttons, so she gets 20 large buttons.

### 5. Trading the Remaining Large Stickers
- She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
  - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.
  - So, 20 large stickers × 3 = 60 small buttons.

### 6. Total Buttons
- Large buttons from small stickers: 9
- Large buttons from large stickers: 20
- Small buttons from large stickers: 60
- Total buttons = 9 + 20 + 60 = 89 buttons.

- Let \( D \) be the distance driven.
- Let \( H \) be the distance hiked.
- Let \( v_d = 50 \) mph be the driving speed.
- Let \( v_h = \frac{v_d}{2} - 5 \) mph be the hiking speed.

### 2. Calculate the hiking speed
- The hiking speed is half the driving speed minus 5 mph:
  \[
  v_h = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ mph}
  \]

### 3. Calculate the distance hiked
- The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours, so the distance hiked is:
  \[
  H = v_h \times t_h = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

### 4. Calculate the time spent driving
- The total time spent driving and hiking is 6 hours. The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours, so the time spent driving is:
  \[
  t_d = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
  \]

### 5. Calculate the distance driven
- The distance driven is:
  \[
  D = v_d \times t_d = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles}

### 1. Define Variables
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B_e \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T_e \) be the time (in seconds) Emma has left on the timer.

### 2. Express Ava's Actions in Terms of Emma's
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_a = E_e + 8 \).
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_a = B_e + 3 \).
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T_a = T_e - 4 \).

### 3. Calculate Emma's Score
- Emma's score: \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \).

### 4. Calculate Ava's Score
- Ava's score: \( S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e - 4) \).

### 5. Simplify Ava's Score
- \( S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e - 120 \).
- \( S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e - 25 \).

### 6. Find the Difference Between Ava's and Emma's Scores
- Difference: \( S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) \).
- \( S_a - S_e = -25 \).

### 7. Interpret the Result
- The negative sign indicates that Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's.

### 1. Define the variables
- Let **z** = ounces of citrus zest
- Let **f** = ounces of fragrance
- Let **s** = ounces of salt
- Let **u** = ounces of sugar
- Let **o** = ounces of oil

### 2. Establish relationships between variables
- **f = z** (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
- **s = u** (same amount of salt as sugar)
- **o = 2s** (twice as much oil as salt)
- **s = 2z** (twice as much salt as zest)

### 3. Express all variables in terms of **z**
- From **s = 2z**, we know **s = 2z**
- From **o = 2s**, substitute **s = 2z**: **o = 2(2z) = 4z**
- From **f = z**, we know **f = z**
- From **s = u**, we know **u = 2z**

### 4. Write the total volume equation
The total volume of the salt scrub is 10 ounces:
- **z + f + s + u + o = 10**

### 5. Substitute all variables in terms of **z**
- **z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10**

### 6. Simplify the equation
- Combine like terms: **10z = 10**

### 7. Solve for **z**
- **z = 1**

### 8. Find the amount of oil (**o**)
- From **o = 4z**, substitute **z = 1**: **o = 4(1) = 4**

- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \).
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \).

### 2
The total number of cards is 341. We can write the equation:
\[
P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
\]

### 3
Combine like terms:
\[
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

### 4
Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( P \):
\[
7P = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7P = 329
\]

### 5
Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[
P = \frac{329}{7}

\[
P = 47

Now, find the number of cards Smendrick has:

- We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross a highway at the same speed.
- We need to find out how long it will take 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same highway.

# 2. Determine the speed of a kangaroo
- Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \).
- Since 3 kangaroos are traveling together, their combined speed is \( 3v \).
- The time taken by the kangaroos is 18 hours, so the distance \( D \) of the highway can be calculated as:
  \[
  D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3v \times 18
  \]
  \[
  D = 54v
  \]

# 3. Determine the speed of a turtle
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).
- Since there are 4 turtles, their combined speed is:
  \[
  4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
  \]

# 4. Calculate the time taken by the turtles
- The distance \( D \) of the highway is \( 54v \).
- The combined speed of the turtles is \( 2v \).
- The time \( T \) taken by the turtles to cross the highway is:
  \[
  T = \frac{D}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
  \]

# 5. Final result
- The time taken by the 4 turtles to cross the highway is **27 hours**.

We know the following relationships:
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).

1. **Define the initial number of notebooks:**
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially had.
   - Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

2. **Determine Martha's initial number of notebooks:**
   - Martha bought 5 more notebooks and now has a total of 7 notebooks.
   - This means \( M + 5 = 7 \).
   - Solving for \( M \), we get \( M = 2 \).

3. **Calculate Joseph's number of notebooks:**
   - Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.
   - Substituting \( M = 2 \), Joseph had \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) notebooks.

4. **Compare the number of notebooks:**
   - Martha now has 7 notebooks.
   - Joseph has 6 notebooks.
   - The difference is \( 7 - 6 = 1 \).

1. **Determine Dijana's distance**  
   Dijana rowed **50 miles** on that day.

2. **Calculate Anis's additional distance**  
   Anis rowed **1/5 times more** than Dijana. This means Anis rowed an additional distance of:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Anis's total distance**  
   Anis's total distance is the sum of Dijana's distance and the additional distance:  
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance rowed by both**  
   The total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis together is:

# 4. Remaining cups for cinnamon tea
- The total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea in all rows is \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) cups.
- However, since 15 cups are used for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are \( 27 - 15 = 12 \) cups.

# 5. Adjusting for whole numbers
- Since the number of cups must be a whole number, the initial assumption of 4.5 cups per type per row is not possible.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the distribution.

# 6. Correct distribution
- Each row must have an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups, and the total must be 9 cups per row.
- The only possible whole number distribution is 4 cups of chamomile and 4 cups of mint tea per row, leaving 1 cup per row unused.
- For 3 rows, this would leave \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) cups unused.

- Let \( D \) represent Deanna's age.

### 2. Use the given information
- Deanna's age is given as \( D = 26 \).
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \).
- Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \).

### 3. Substitute Deanna's age into Marcus's age
- \( M = D - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \).

### 4. Use Marcus's age to find Leo's age
- \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \), so \( 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \).

### 1. Define the variables
- Let \( B \) be the points scored by Bahati.
- Let \( A \) be the points scored by Azibo.
- Let \( D \) be the points scored by Dinar.

### 2. Set up the relationships
- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo: \( B = A + 20 \).
- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar: \( B = D + 10 \).
- The total points scored by the team is 45: \( B + A + D = 45 \).

### 3. Express \( D \) in terms of \( B \)
From \( B = D + 10 \), we can express \( D \) as:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

### 4. Substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \)
From \( B = A + 20 \), substitute \( B \) into the equation for \( D \):
\[ D = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \]

### 5. Substitute \( B \) and \( D \) into the total points equation
Now, substitute \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = A + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

### 6. Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

### 7. Solve for \( A \)
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

### 8. Verify the solution
- \( A = 5 \)
- \( B = A + 20 = 25 \)
- \( D = A + 10 = 15 \)
- Total: \( 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \) (which matches the given total)

**1. Identify the cost of supplies**  
- The total cost of supplies is given as **$400**.

**2. Understand the relationship between travel cost and supplies**  
- The travel cost is **50% more** than the cost of supplies.

**3. Calculate 50% of the cost of supplies**  
- 50% of $400 is calculated as:  
  \( 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \).

**4. Add the 50% to the cost of supplies to find the travel cost**  
- The travel cost is the cost of supplies plus 50% of the cost of supplies:  
  \( 400 + 200 = 600 \).

- Let \( A \) = number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) = number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( D \) = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Step 2** Translate the given information into equations:
1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon:  
   \( A + S + D = 339 \).
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:  
   \( A = S + 5 \).
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:  
   \( S = 4D - 13 \).

**Step 3** Substitute \( A \) and \( S \) in the first equation using the other two equations:
- Replace \( A \) with \( S + 5 \):  
  \( (S + 5) + S + D = 339 \).
- Replace \( S \) with \( 4D - 13 \):  
  \( (4D - 13 + 5) + (4D - 13) + D = 339 \).

**Step 4** Simplify the equation:
- Combine like terms:  
  \( 4D - 8 + 4D - 13 + D = 339 \).  
  \( 9D - 21 = 339 \).

**Step 5** Solve for \( D \):
- Add 21 to both sides:  
  \( 9D = 360 \).
- Divide by 9:  
  \( D = 40 \).

**Step 6** Find \( S \) using \( S = 4D - 13 \):
- Substitute \( D = 40 \):  
  \( S = 4(40) - 13 \).  
  \( S = 160 - 13 \).  
  \( S = 147 \).

- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
- We need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Step 2** Determine the time between the two sightings:
- Since the comet orbits every 75 years, the time between Bill's first and second sightings is 75 years.

**Step 3** Calculate Bill's age at the second sighting:
- Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet.
- Bill was three times that age when he saw the comet the second time.
- So, Bill's age at the second sighting = 3 * 30 = 90 years.

**Step 4** Calculate Bill's age at the first sighting:
- The time between the two sightings is 75 years.
- Bill's age at the second sighting is 90 years.
- Therefore, Bill's age at the first sighting = 90 - 75 = 15 years.

1. **Calculate the number of easy questions:**
   - Total questions = 60
   - 40% of 60 = \( 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \) easy questions.

2. **Calculate the number of average and difficult questions:**
   - Remaining questions = \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
   - These are equally divided into average and difficult questions: \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) average and 18 difficult questions.

3. **Calculate the number of easy questions Aries gets correct:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - \( 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \) easy questions correct.

4. **Calculate the number of average questions Aries gets correct:**
   - Aries gets half of the average questions correct.
   - \( 0.5 \times 18 = 9 \) average questions correct.

5. **Calculate the number of difficult questions Aries gets correct:**
   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions correct.
   - \( 0.5 \times 18 = 9 \) difficult questions correct.

6. **Calculate the total number of questions Aries gets correct:**
   - Total correct = Easy correct + Average correct + Difficult correct

4. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so total hours worked = \( \frac{63}{8} \times 24 = 189 \) hours.

### 1. Define Variables
- Let \( x \) be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
- In the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so the first set is \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

### 2. Set Up the Equation
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.
- Therefore, the equation is:
  \[
  (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]

### 3. Solve the Equation
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]
- Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  4x + 8 + x = 38
  \]
- Combine like terms again:
  \[
  5x + 8 = 38
  \]
- Subtract 8 from both sides:
  \[
  5x = 30
  \]
- Divide both sides by 5:
  \[
  x = 6

1060,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

### 1. **Understand the given information**
   - Total pizzas: 4
   - Slices per pizza: 8
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Becky ate 10 slices.

### 2. **Calculate the total number of slices**
   - Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
   - Total slices = 4 × 8 = 32 slices.

### 3. **Express the number of slices eaten by each person in terms of Jake's slices**
   - Let Jake's slices = \( J \).
   - Becky's slices = \( J + 3 \).
   - Silvia's slices = \( 2J \).

### 4. **Use the information about Becky's slices to find Jake's slices**
   - Becky ate 10 slices, so:
   - \( J + 3 = 10 \).
   - Solving for \( J \): \( J = 10 - 3 = 7 \).

### 5. **Calculate Silvia's slices**
   - Silvia's slices = \( 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \).

### 6. **Calculate the total slices eaten by all three**
   - Total slices eaten = Jake's slices + Becky's slices + Silvia's slices
   - Total slices eaten = \( 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 \).

### 7. **Verify the total slices eaten against the total available slices**
   - Total slices available = 32.
   - Total slices eaten = 31.
   - This leaves 1 slice uneaten, which is consistent with the problem.

- Total bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

### 2
- Calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually.
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Total cost individually = 40 bananas × $0.80/banana = $32.00.

### 3
- Calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Total cost in bunches = 10 bunches × $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

### 4
- Calculate the savings by buying in bunches instead of individually.
- Savings = Cost individually - Cost in bunches.
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

- The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the remaining meat is:

- The chalk starts at 5 inches.

**Step 2** Calculate how much chalk was used on Monday:
- The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
- 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

**Step 3** Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:
- Remaining chalk = Initial length - Used length = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

**Step 4** Determine the daily usage after Monday:
- The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
- 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day.

**Step 5** Calculate how many days the chalk can be used before it falls below 2 inches:
- Let \( n \) be the number of days.
- The chalk will be recycled when the remaining length is less than 2 inches.
- The equation is: \( 2.75 - 0.55n < 2 \).

**Step 6** Solve for \( n \):
- \( 2.75 - 0.55n < 2 \)
- Subtract 2.75 from both sides: \( -0.55n < -0.75 \)
- Divide both sides by -0.55 (remember to reverse the inequality sign): \( n > \frac{0.75}{0.55} \)
- \( n > 1.36 \)

**Step 7** Interpret the result:
- Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day before it falls below 2 inches.

- Colin's age seven years from now: \( C + 7 \).
- Wendy's current age: \( W = 5(C + 7) \).

**Step 3** Translate the second statement into an equation:

- John is now 28 years old.  
- We need to find Jim's current age.  

**Step 2** Determine the time elapsed since Digimon came out  
- Digimon's 20th anniversary means it has been 20 years since it first came out.  

**Step 3** Calculate John's age when Digimon came out  
- John is now 28 years old.

   Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. Since her sister ate 2 slices, her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

- Let \( x \) be the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day.
- We need to track the number of bandages used and ordered each day to find \( x \).

**Step 2** Calculate the number of bandages after the first day:
- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Bandages after the first day: \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \).

**Step 3** Calculate the number of bandages after the second day:
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
- No bandages were ordered on the second day.
- Bandages after the second day: \( (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16 \).

**Step 4** Calculate the number of bandages after the third day:
- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \( 25 \) bandages.
- Bandages after the third day: \( (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \).

1. **Initial Loan Amount**: Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister.
2. **Interest Rate**: He promised to return the loan with an additional 2% of the money he owed.
3. **Monthly Payments**: For 11 months, Stephen will pay $25 each month.
4. **Final Payment**: The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month.
5. **Objective**: Determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

### Calculating the Total Amount to be Repaid

1. **Calculating the Interest**:
   - Interest = 2% of $300
   - Interest = 0.02 * $300 = $6
2. **Total Amount to be Repaid**:
   - Total Repayment = Principal + Interest
   - Total Repayment = $300 + $6 = $306

### Calculating the Total Amount Paid Over 11 Months

1. **Monthly Payment**: $25 per month
2. **Number of Months**: 11
3. **Total Paid Over 11 Months**:
   - Total Paid = $25 * 11 = $275

### Determining the Remaining Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month

1. **Remaining Amount**:
   - Remaining Amount = Total Repayment - Total Paid Over 11 Months
   - Remaining Amount = $306 - $275 = $31

- The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
- Volume = length × width × height = 6 × 6 × 15 = **540 cubic inches**.

### 2. Calculate the total number of jelly beans the jar can hold
- Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
- Total jelly beans = (Volume of jar) / (Volume per jelly bean) = 540 / 0.15 = **3600 jelly beans**.

### 3. Adjust for packing efficiency
- The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans.
- Adjusted total jelly beans = Total jelly beans × Packing efficiency = 3600 × 0.8 = **2880 jelly beans**.

### 4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans
- Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
- Estimated red jelly beans = Adjusted total jelly beans × 0.3 = 2880 × 0.3 = **864 red jelly beans**.

### 5. Compare the estimate to the true number of red jelly beans
- The true number of red jelly beans is **900**.
- Difference = True number - Estimated number = 900 - 864 = **36**.

- Madeline ate **6 grapes**.

# 2. Calculate the number of grapes her brother used for grape juice
- Her brother used **5 times** as many grapes as Madeline.
- So, he used \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.

# 3. Find the total grapes used by Madeline and her brother
- Madeline used **6 grapes**.
- Her brother used **30 grapes**.
- Total grapes used so far: \( 6 + 30 = 36 \) grapes.

# 4. Determine the number of grapes used by their mother for pies
- Their mother made **4 pies**.
- Each pie requires **12 grapes**.
- Total grapes used for pies: \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) grapes.

# 5. Calculate the total number of grapes at the beginning
- Total grapes used: \( 36 \) (Madeline and her brother) + \( 48 \) (mother) = **84 grapes**.

### 1. **Identify the requested items:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

### 2. **Determine what Igor actually gathered:**
   - Test tubes: Igor gathered half as many as requested, so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than requested, so \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
   - Beakers: Igor picked up the correct number (7), but lost some on the way.

### 3. **Calculate the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench:**
   - Total items placed: 29
   - Items accounted for: Test tubes (8) + Petri dishes (16) = 24
   - Therefore, the number of beakers placed on the bench is \( 29 - 24 = 5 \).

### 4. **Determine how many beakers were lost:**
   - Igor initially picked up 7 beakers.
   - He placed 5 beakers on the bench.
   - Therefore, the number of beakers lost is \( 7 - 5 = 2 \).

1. **Define Variables**  
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations**  
   - The total number of animals is 20:  
     \[
     c + w = 20
     \]
   - The total number of legs is 70 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs):  
     \[
     2c + 4w = 70
     \]

3. **Simplify the Legs Equation**  
   - Divide the second equation by 2 to simplify:  
     \[
     c + 2w = 35
     \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations**  
   - Subtract the first equation (\( c + w = 20 \)) from the simplified legs equation (\( c + 2w = 35 \)):  
     \[
     (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
     \]
     \[
     w = 15
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Chickens**  
   - Substitute \( w = 15 \) into the first equation (\( c + w = 20 \)):  
     \[
     c + 15 = 20
     \]
     \[
     c = 5
