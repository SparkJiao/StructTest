0,"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs she consumes**: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes daily is:
   \[
   3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for muffins)} = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining for sale**: To find out how many eggs Janet has left to sell at the farmers' market, we subtract the number of eggs she consumes from the total number of eggs laid:
   \[
   16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (eggs consumed)} = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the eggs**: Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her total earnings from selling the eggs are:

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It also requires half that amount of white fiber. Since half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt, the robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we can calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the bolts of blue and white fiber together:

Total bolts = bolts of blue fiber + bolts of white fiber
Total bolts = 2 + 1 = 3

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe is \boxed{3}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'Suffix5PhrasesMathFormat'}
2,"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we first need to calculate the total cost he incurred and then the selling price after the value increase.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Repair costs: $50,000
   - Total cost = Purchase price + Repair costs
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased value of the house:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we first calculate 150% of the original purchase price.
   - Original value of the house = $80,000
   - Increase in value = 150% of $80,000
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000
   \]
   - New value of the house = Original value + Increase in value
   \[
   \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000

4,"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for her flock of 20 chickens.

Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, for 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

\[
\text{Total feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we need to account for the feed that Wendi has already given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, she gives:

\[
15 \text{ cups}
\]

In the afternoon, she gives:

\[
25 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of feed given so far:

\[
\text{Total feed given} = 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal of the day, we subtract the total feed given from the total daily feed requirement:

\[
\text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total feed} - \text{Total feed given} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

5,"To calculate the total cost for Kylar's 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure:

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.

Let's break down the costs:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is:
  \[
  0.6 \times 5 = 3
  \]

Now, we can see that the pattern continues for every pair of glasses:
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.

This pattern repeats for every two glasses. Therefore, for every pair of glasses (1st and 2nd, 3rd and 4th, etc.), the total cost is:
\[
5 + 3 = 8
\]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine how many pairs of glasses he will buy:
\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for all 16 glasses:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ pairs} \times 8 \text{ dollars per pair} = 64
\]

Thus, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for the 16 glasses is:

1. **First Leg of the Journey (to the destination)**:
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Turning Around**:
   - After reaching his destination, he turns around to go back home.

3. **Second Leg of the Journey (returning home)**:
   - John has a total of 4 hours to get home, but he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. During this time, he does not cover any distance.
   - After 2 hours of standstill traffic, he has 2 hours left to drive.

4. **Driving at 30 mph**:
   - For the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - At this point, he has been on the road for 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic + 0.5 hours driving).

5. **Driving at 80 mph**:
   - He has 1.5 hours left (4 hours total - 2.5 hours already spent).
   - He drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

6. **Total Distance Driven Back Towards Home**:
   - Total distance driven back towards home = Distance at 30 mph + Distance at 80 mph = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

7. **Calculating Distance from Home**:
   - Initially, John was 180 miles away from home.
   - After driving back for 135 miles, the distance from home = Initial distance - Distance driven back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Thus, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 45 miles away from home.

   \text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Regular Rate} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Overtime Hours**: Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, which means she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 hours - 40 hours).
   \[
   \text{Overtime Hours} = 45 \, \text{hours} - 40 \, \text{hours} = 5 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Overtime Rate**: Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   \[
   \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times \text{Regular Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 12 \, \text{dollars/hour}

1. **First Month**: The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month**: The downloads in the second month were three times the downloads in the first month. 
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the tree is $90.

2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemons} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}

3. **Annual Costs**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3. Thus, the total annual costs are:
   \[
   \text{Annual Costs} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Annual Profit**: The annual profit can be calculated by subtracting the annual costs from the annual revenue:
   \[
   \text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Costs} = 10.5 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Break-even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90 with the annual profit of $7.5, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7.5 \text{ dollars/year} \times n \text{ years} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{90 \text{ dollars}}{7.5 \text{ dollars/year}} = 12 \text{ years}

20,"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink before any spillage occurs.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters and is two-thirds water.
   - The amount of water in the orange drink is:
     \[
     \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters and is three-fifths water.
   - The amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water before spillage:**
   - The total amount of water before spilling any orange drink is:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = \text{Water in orange drink} + \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{20}{3} + 9
     \]
   - To add these, we convert 9 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     9 = \frac{27}{3}
     \]
   - Now we can add:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Account for the spillage:**
   - We spilled 1 liter of the orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the spilled orange drink is:
     \[
     \text{Water in spilled orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \text{ liters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the amount of water remaining after the spillage is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining water} = \text{Total water} - \text{Water in spilled orange drink} = \frac{47}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \text{ liters}

21,"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we first need to establish Raymond's age.

Since Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before her, we can calculate Raymond's age as follows:

Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6 = 37 years old

Next, we know that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how old Raymond's son is now, we subtract the age at which Raymond had his son from Raymond's current age:

Age of Raymond's son = Raymond's current age - Age at which he had his son
Age of Raymond's son = 37 - 23 = 14 years old

Now, to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we simply note that if he is currently 14 years old, he was born 14 years ago.

1. The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD:
   - Number of DVDs sold = 3 customers × 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

2. The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs:
   - Number of DVDs sold = 2 customers × 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

3. The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs:
   - Number of DVDs sold = 3 customers × 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs

Now, we can add the total number of DVDs sold from each group:
- Total DVDs sold = 3 DVDs (from the first group) + 4 DVDs (from the second group) + 0 DVDs (from the last group)
- Total DVDs sold = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs

24,"To find the original price of the book, we can use the information given about the discount. 

Let the original price of the book be denoted as \( P \). According to the problem, Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means that he paid 75% of the original price, since 100% - 25% = 75%.

We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:

\[
0.75P = 19.50
\]

To find \( P \), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[
P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}

1. **Cost of the chicken meal**: 
   \[
   1 \text{ chicken meal} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the milk packs**: 
   \[
   5 \text{ packs of milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the apples**: 
   \[
   4 \text{ apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples:
\[
\text{Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples} = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we know that Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total cost of pizza} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of pizza} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{\text{Total cost of pizza}}{\text{Cost per box}} = \frac{17}{8.50}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} \approx 2
\]

To confirm, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to check if it matches the total cost of pizza:
\[
2 \times 8.50 = 17 \text{ dollars}

   Therefore, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. To find 25% of 80, we calculate:
   \[
   0.25 \times 80 = 20

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   \[
   S + G = 110
   \]

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. Replacing \( G \) in the first equation gives us:
\[
S + (S + 30) = 110
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
2S + 30 = 110

Next, we can isolate \( S \) by subtracting 30 from both sides:
\[
2S = 110 - 30
\]
\[
2S = 80
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[
S = 40

41,"To determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand while still being able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we first need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone is:

Distance with gemstone = 3 × 400 feet = 1200 feet.

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

Distance outside the flames = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's flame reach
Distance outside the flames = 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

1. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
2. You have already consumed 1800 calories.
3. Therefore, the calories remaining for you to consume are:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips and how many grams that corresponds to.

1. According to the nutritional info, there are 250 calories per serving.
2. The bag contains 5 servings, so the total calories in the bag is:
   \[
   5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories.

1. The number of servings you can consume is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings}

44,"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, we need to calculate both his total revenue from selling the candles and his total costs for making them.

1. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. If he sells 20 candles, his total revenue (TR) can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   TR = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

   So, his total revenue is $40.00.

2. **Calculate Total Costs:**
   Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax. To make 20 candles, he needs:

   \[
   \text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the total cost (TC) for 2 pounds is:

   \[
   TC = \text{Pounds of beeswax} \times \text{Cost per pound} = 2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

   So, his total costs are $20.00.

3. **Calculate Net Profit:**
   Net profit (NP) is calculated by subtracting total costs from total revenue:

   \[
   NP = TR - TC = 40 - 20 = 20

1. **Articles written on Monday**: 
   Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

2. **Articles written on Tuesday**: 
   She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. 
   To calculate this, we first find \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
   \[
   5 + 2 = 7
   \]

3. **Articles written on Wednesday**: 
   On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Now we have the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26
\]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can now calculate the total time spent:
\[
26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

2. **Post-it Notes Used**: At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.

3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

Now, we can set up an equation to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased.

Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought.

The total number of Post-it notes after buying the package and before using any is:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, this amount equals 23:
\[
(80 + x) - 220 = 23
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]
\[
x - 140 = 23
\]
\[
x = 23 + 140
\]
\[
x = 163

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. To find the number of blue ties, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties is:
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of red ties:**
   The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40, the cost of a red tie can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of red ties:**
   Now that we know the cost of a red tie is $60 and John bought 10 red ties, we can find the total cost of the red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   Finally, we add the total cost of blue ties and the total cost of red ties to find the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

52,"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to calculate the total weight of the comic books he is removing.

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound. If he removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed from the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove from his bag after removing the comic books. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books. Therefore, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to achieve the remaining 7.5 pounds, we can set up the equation:

Let \( x \) be the number of toys he needs to remove. The total weight removed from the toys will be:

\[
x \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \text{ pounds}
\]

We need this weight to equal 7.5 pounds:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7.5

     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14
     \]
   - Therefore, the new monthly charge for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - For 6 months, the total charge is:
     \[

64,"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

1. **Calculate the miles driven per gallon**:
   - Sophia has driven 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles driven by the gallons used:
     \[
     \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank**:
   - The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - To find out how far she can drive on a full tank, we multiply her fuel efficiency by the total capacity of the tank:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}

   \]

2. The team won 8 more games than they lost:

2. **Annual Salary**: To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = 600 \times 12 = 7200
   \]

3. **Salary Increase**: After five years, she is eligible for a 10% increase on her initial salary. The increase is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 7200 = 720
   \]

4. **New Annual Salary After 5 Years**: After the increase, her new annual salary becomes:
   \[
   \text{New Annual Salary} = 7200 + 720 = 7920
   \]

5. **Salary After Three More Years**: Since the company policy states that the increase is only applied after five years, we need to consider that her salary will remain the same for the next three years. Therefore, her annual salary after three more years of service will still be:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary After Three More Years} = 7920
   \]

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be:

89,"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags for her birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the expected number of attendees**: Since 1/4 of the invited guests are expected not to show up, we can calculate the number of attendees as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = \text{Total invited} - \text{No-shows}
   \]
   The number of no-shows is:
   \[
   \text{No-shows} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
   \]
   Therefore, the expected number of attendees is:
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 16 - 4 = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of gift bags needed**: Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. Thus, the total number of gift bags required is:
   \[
   \text{Gift bags needed} = 0.75 \times \text{Number of attendees} = 0.75 \times 12 = 9
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the gift bags**: Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Gift bags needed} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 9 \times 2 = 18
   \]

Thus, Christina will spend a total of $18 on gift bags for her birthday party.

- Let Jackson's age be \( J \).
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Corey is 2 years older than Amy, so Corey's age is \( (J + 5) + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James is 10 years old.

According to the problem, James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\text{James's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 1
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
10 = (J + 7) - 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
10 = J + 6
\]

Now, we can solve for \( J \):

\[
J = 10 - 6 = 4
\]

Thus, Jackson is 4 years old.

Now, let's summarize the ages to ensure everything checks out:

- Jackson: \( J = 4 \)
- Amy: \( J + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \)
- Corey: \( J + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \)
- James: 10 (given)

Now, we verify the relationships:
- Amy is indeed 5 years older than Jackson (9 vs 4).
- Corey is indeed 2 years older than Amy (11 vs 9).
- James is indeed 1 year younger than Corey (10 vs 11).

Everything checks out correctly.

93,"Let's start by determining how fast Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change.

According to the problem, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[
\text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we know that Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. To find out how much faster he can run, we first need to calculate 10% of his original time:

\[
10\% \text{ of Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds}
\]

This means that with the improvement, Gerald's new time will be:

\[
\text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - 10\% \text{ of Gerald's original time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds}

   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of dogs and cats**: Now we can find the total number of dogs and cats combined:
   \[
   \text{Total dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180

1. **Volume Loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that if she starts with a certain volume of canned tomatoes, the volume of sauce produced will be half of that.

2. **Volume of Sauce**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Since the sauce is half the volume of the canned tomatoes used, we can calculate the volume of canned tomatoes she started with:
   \[
   \text{Volume of canned tomatoes} = 2 \times \text{Volume of sauce} = 2 \times 32 \text{ ounces} = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Cans of Tomatoes**: Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of canned tomatoes by the volume of one can:

- Before bed: 1 glass

This totals to:
1 (breakfast) + 1 (lunch) + 1 (dinner) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses of water per day.

Since there are 5 weekdays, we calculate the total for the weekdays:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water during the weekdays.

On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John does not drink water with dinner; instead, he has soda. Therefore, on the weekends, he only drinks water at breakfast, lunch, and before bed:

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract twice the thickness (1 inch on each side) from each dimension to find the inner dimensions.

1. **Calculate the inner length:**
   \[
   \text{Inner Length} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches}

2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 110 - 10
\]
\[
2x = 100
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{100}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 50.

109,"To calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we first need to determine the total cost of the gas before any cashback is applied.

1. The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
2. If someone buys 10 gallons, the total cost before cashback is:
   \[
   10 \text{ gallons} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 30.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the cashback received for the purchase:

1. The cashback offered is $0.20 per gallon.
2. For 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
   \[
   10 \text{ gallons} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas:

1. The total cost after cashback is:

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups she ate is calculated by multiplying the width by the length:
  \[
  \text{Total for Beatrice} = 2 \text{ (width)} \times 24 \text{ (length)} = 48 \text{ roll-ups}
  \]

For Marcell:
- His roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups he ate is calculated similarly:
  \[
  \text{Total for Marcell} = 3 \text{ (width)} \times 14 \text{ (length)} = 42 \text{ roll-ups}

111,"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we first need to calculate the total distance she rowed and the rate at which water was taken on.

1. **Calculate the total distance to shore:**
   Julia took 64 seconds to reach the shore. We know from the problem that she rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can find her rowing speed:

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   The problem states that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can find out how many 10-foot segments are in the total distance of 80 feet:

   \[
   \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 8
   \]

   Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each 10-foot segment, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on:

   \[
   \text{Total Water} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone:
   \[
   J = 6B
   \]
   where \( J \) is the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold. We are given that \( J = 1800 \). Therefore:
   \[
   1800 = 6B
   \]
   To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $10
     - Number of boards = 10
     - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Cost per board = $16
     - Number of boards = 5
     - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

   - Total cost of all lumber = Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price after the price increase:**
   - The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards has increased by 50%:
     - New price per board = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15
     - Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150

   - The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards has also increased by 50%:
     - New price per board = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24
     - Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120

   - Total revenue from selling all lumber = Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270

116,"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ratio of sugar to water, which is given as 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, we can determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[
7 + 13 = 20 \text{ parts}
\]

Next, we know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons. We can express this total in terms of the parts:
\[
\text{Total amount} = 20 \text{ parts} = 120 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

To find the value of one part, we divide the total amount by the number of parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120 \text{ teaspoons}}{20 \text{ parts}} = 6 \text{ teaspoons per part}
\]

Now, we can calculate the amount of sugar used. Since sugar corresponds to 7 parts in the ratio, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts for sugar:
\[
\text{Amount of sugar} = 7 \text{ parts} \times 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} = 42 \text{ teaspoons}

On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Vehicles from first day} = 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
\]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:

\[
\text{Vehicles added on second day} = \text{Total vehicles} - \text{Vehicles from first day} = 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
\]

Now, we know that each container contains 5 vehicles. To find the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

\[
\text{Number of containers on second day} = \frac{\text{Vehicles added on second day}}{\text{Vehicles per container}} = \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers}

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago**:
   - We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Then Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as:
     \[
     A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
     \]
   - We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
     \[
     1.3L = 40000
     \]
   - To find Lylah's salary, we solve for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later**:
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later is:
     \[
     A_{new} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
     \]

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later**:
   - Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to find out how much Lylah's salary increased. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago, so we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - If we assume Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (which is 40%), then Lylah's salary four years later is:
     \[
     L_{new} = L + 0.4L = L \times 1.4

Next, we calculate how many fruits Kael brought:

- Kael brought twice the amount of apples that Morisette brought. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples}
  \]
- Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought:

   - Time available: 8 hours

   The total number of questions Mark could complete in 8 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions}

We know the total number of cars is 20, and we have the following breakdown:
- Automatic cars: 12
- Manual cars: 4

Now, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Number of semi-automatic cars = 4

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula for percentage is:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) × 100

Substituting the values we have:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) × 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 × 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of bees in the hive is 700:
   \[
   w + b + q = 700
   \]

2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
   \[
   w = 2b
   \]

3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens:
   \[
   b = 2q
   \]

Now, we can express everything in terms of \( q \):

From the third equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( q \):
\[
b = 2q
\]

Substituting \( b \) into the second equation gives us:
\[
w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q
\]

Now we have expressions for \( w \) and \( b \) in terms of \( q \):
- \( w = 4q \)
- \( b = 2q \)

Now we can substitute these into the first equation:
\[
w + b + q = 700
\]
Substituting for \( w \) and \( b \):
\[
4q + 2q + q = 700
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
7q = 700
\]
Now, we can solve for \( q \):
\[
q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

Now that we have \( q \), we can find \( b \) and \( w \):
\[
b = 2q = 2(100) = 200
\]
\[
w = 4q = 4(100) = 400

   \]

2. **Seagull's Consumption**: The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is:
   \[
   \text{Seagull's fries: } \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
   After the seagull ate, the remaining fries are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after seagull: } (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21

**Classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
- Kimo has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, on each of these days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Since he has classes on 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total for these days in one week is:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

**Classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
- Kimo has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, on each of these days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Since he has classes on 2 days (Tuesday and Thursday), the total for these days in one week is:

3. **Baguettes**:
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes = Number of baguettes × Length of each baguette
   \[
   \text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Each back-and-forth run consists of running to one end of the field and back to the starting point, which is a total distance of:

\[
100 \text{ yards (to the end)} + 100 \text{ yards (back)} = 200 \text{ yards}
\]

Since Blake does this 15 times, the total distance he runs is:

\[
15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is:

\[

\]

After that, she runs to the 40-yard line and back. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is:

\[
40 \text{ yards (to the 40-yard line)} + 40 \text{ yards (back)} = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Kelly repeats this 34 times, so the total distance for this part is:

1. **Calculate the minimum payments:**
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

2. **Calculate 50% more than the minimum payments:**
   - For student loans: 
     \[
     300 + 0.5 \times 300 = 300 + 150 = 450
     \]
   - For credit card: 
     \[
     200 + 0.5 \times 200 = 200 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - For mortgage: 
     \[
     500 + 0.5 \times 500 = 500 + 250 = 750
     \]

3. **Total monthly payment:**
   Now, we sum these amounts to find her total monthly payment:
   \[
   450 + 300 + 750 = 1500
   \]

4. **Calculate the annual payment:**
   To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her total monthly payment by 12:
   \[
   1500 \times 12 = 18000
   \]

Thus, Jessica pays a total of $18,000 in a year on her debts.

175,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to analyze their costs and revenues.

1. **Cost of Ingredients**:
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost per Gallon} = \text{Cost of Lemons} + \text{Cost of Sugar} = 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Revenue from Selling Lemonade**:
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Thus, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is:
     \[
     \text{Revenue per Gallon} = \text{Price per Glass} \times \text{Number of Glasses} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. Given that they made $25 in profit, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     25 = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - If they made \( n \) gallons, then:
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 10n \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Total Cost} = 5n
     \]
   - Therefore, the profit equation becomes:
     \[
     25 = 10n - 5n
     \]
     \[
     25 = 5n
     \]
   - Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{25}{5} = 5
     \]

4. **Total Costs**:
   - Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can calculate the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 5n = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Cost of Lemons**:
   - The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Lemons} = 3n = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount Juan and Carlos spent on lemons is:

1. For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours. Since he earns $10 per hour, we can calculate his earnings for the first week as follows:
   \[
   \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hours tutored} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 50 \text{ dollars}

   - Jean is two years older than Mark.

2. **Set up the equations**:
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can express Jean's age as \( J = M + 2 \).

3. **Use the information from two years ago**:
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. This gives us the equation:

Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for Team A is:
\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Team B (less well-rounded team):**
The first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

   The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
   \[
   P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

   The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is the same:
   \[
   P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

   Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

   To express this as a percentage:
   \[
   P(\text{two evens}) = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%

3. **Calculating how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers:**
   We need to find the difference in probabilities:

   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is:

   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is:

3. **Rabbits**:
   - The problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total straw distributed:
\[
\text{Total straw} = \text{Straw for rats} + \text{Straw for hamsters} + \text{Straw for rabbits}
\]
Substituting the expressions we found:
\[

Now, we simplify this equation:
\[

Next, we can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \) or vice versa. However, we can also try some reasonable values for \( r \) and see if we can find integer values for \( h \).

Let's isolate \( h \):
\[
50h = 140 - 18r
\]
\[
h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
\]

To ensure \( h \) is an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can test integer values for \( r \):

- **If \( r = 0 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 0}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 1 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 18}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 2 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 36}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 3 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 54}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 4 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 72}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]

- **If \( r = 5 \)**:
  \[
  h = \frac{140 - 90}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
  \]

Now we have \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \). 

To verify:
- Total straw for rats: \( 3 \times 5 \times 6 = 90 \)
- Total straw for hamsters: \( 10 \times 1 \times 5 = 50 \)
- Total straw for rabbits: \( 20 \)

2. **Cost of Food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, the cost of food can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Food} = \text{Cost of Tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]

3. **Cost of Rides**: They went on 2 rides, each costing $33. Thus, the total cost for the rides is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66
   \]

4. **Total Expenses**: Now, we can calculate the total expenses by adding the costs of tickets, food, and rides:
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Cost of Tickets} + \text{Cost of Food} + \text{Cost of Rides} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = 102
   \]

5. **Cost per Friend**: Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly among the three friends, we divide the total expenses by 3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per Friend} = \frac{\text{Total Expenses}}{3} = \frac{102}{3} = 34
   \]

Thus, each friend paid $34.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net growth of trees per year**: 
   - Tom plants 10 trees each year.
   - He chops down 2 trees each year.
   - Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
     \[
     \text{Net increase} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
     \]

3. **Total increase over 10 years**:
   - Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
     \[
     \text{Total increase} = 8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
     \]

4. **Total number of trees before any die**:
   - After 10 years, the total number of trees before accounting for any deaths is:
     \[
     \text{Total trees} = \text{Initial trees} + \text{Total increase} = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93**: 
   Since Brinley will drop the lowest score, we will consider the total of the five highest scores. To find the total score needed for an average of 93 over 6 tests (after dropping one), we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Total needed} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of tests} = 93 \times 5 = 465
   \]

   This means that after dropping the lowest score, the sum of the five highest scores must equal 465.

2. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores**:
   Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We first calculate the sum of these scores:

   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test**:
   Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score including the sixth test will be:

   \[
   438 + x
   \]

   After dropping the lowest score, we need this total to equal 465. The lowest score among the five tests is 71, so we can set up the equation:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465
   \]

   Simplifying this gives:

   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 465 \\
   367 + x = 465 \\
   x = 465 - 367 \\
   x = 98

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[

Now, we find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes:

\[
\text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money after babysitting} = 70 - 30 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn. She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40.

Let \( x \) be the number of times she mows the lawn. The equation for her earnings from mowing the lawn is:

\[
4x = 40
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[
x = \frac{40}{4} = 10
\]

Thus, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

211,"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know two things:

1. The total number of eggs produced by the chickens is 42 eggs per day.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

Next, we can express the total egg production in terms of \( r \) and \( w \):
- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs, so \( r \) red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs.
- Each white chicken produces 5 eggs, so \( w \) white chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs.

The total egg production can be written as:
\[
3r + 5w = 42
\]

Now, we can substitute \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

Expanding this gives:
\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

Combining like terms results in:
\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Next, we isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[
8r = 32
\]

Now, divide both sides by 8:
\[
r = 4
\]

Thus, the number of red chickens Jerry has is 4. 

To verify, we can find the number of white chickens:
\[
w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

Now, we check the total egg production:
- Red chickens produce: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs.
- White chickens produce: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs.
- Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the given information.

Therefore, the solution is consistent.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

In this case, the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. Plugging in these values:

\[
P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}

Now that we know the perimeter is 15 miles, we can calculate the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) taken to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( s \) is given by the formula:

\[
t = \frac{d}{s}

214,"Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now, and \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now.

Since both pools have leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we can determine how much water was in each pool 4 minutes ago.

4 minutes ago, the small pool had:
\[
S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \text{ gallons}
\]
4 minutes ago, the big pool had:
\[
B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:
\[
B + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
B = 2S + 32 - 16
\]
\[
B = 2S + 16 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Now, we also know that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[
B = 4S \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[
2S + 16 = 4S
\]

Now, we can solve for \( S \):
\[
16 = 4S - 2S
\]
\[
16 = 2S
\]
\[
S = 8
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( B \) using equation (2):
\[
B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32
\]

Thus, the small pool currently has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. 

Now, we add these two amounts together:

\[
320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00
\]

So, the total cost for the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn this amount. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we can find the number of hours by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[
\text{Hours} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Hourly Wage}} = \frac{352.00}{8.00}

   - Janeth borrowed $2000.
   - She promised to return it with an additional 10%.
   - The additional amount is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Additional amount} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200

2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age: \( A = 3H \).
3. Harriet's age is half of Zack's age: \( H = \frac{1}{2}Z \).

First, we can calculate Adrian's age using Harriet's age:
\[
A = 3H = 3 \times 21 = 63.
\]

Next, we can find Zack's age using Harriet's age:
\[
H = \frac{1}{2}Z \implies Z = 2H = 2 \times 21 = 42.
\]

Now we have the current ages:
- Adrian: \( A = 63 \)
- Harriet: \( H = 21 \)
- Zack: \( Z = 42 \)

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66 \).
- Harriet's age in three years: \( H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \).
- Zack's age in three years: \( Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 \).

- Naomi's score: \( N = 68 \)
- Yuri's score: \( Y \)
- Brianna's score: \( B \)
- Jojo's score: \( J \)

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
   \[
   Y = \frac{N}{2} + 10
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   Y = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44

2. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   B = N + 17
   \]
   Substituting \( N = 68 \):
   \[
   B = 68 + 17 = 85

Now we can find Jojo's score using the total points scored by all students:
\[
N + Y + B + J = 251
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251

1. **Determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats**: 
   Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Steve's consumption} = 2 \times \text{Girlfriend's consumption}
   \]
   Therefore, if Steve eats 6 tomatoes:
   \[
   6 = 2 \times \text{Girlfriend's consumption}
   \]
   Solving for the girlfriend's consumption:
   \[
   \text{Girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total daily consumption of tomatoes**:
   Now, we can find out how many tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend consume together:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption} = \text{Steve's consumption} + \text{Girlfriend's consumption} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly consumption**:
   To find out how many tomatoes they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

4. **Determine how many tomatoes one vine produces in a week**:
   According to the problem, one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

5. **Calculate the number of vines needed**:
   To find out how many vines Steve needs to produce enough tomatoes for a week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes per vine}} = \frac{63}{3} = 21

236,"To determine how many total pens Ram can have, we start with the initial number of pens he buys and then consider how he can create new pens from the empty ones.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Using the Pens**: As Ram uses the pens, they will eventually become empty. For every 5 empty pens, he can mix the ink to create 1 new pen.

3. **Calculating New Pens from Empty Pens**:
   - After using the initial 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
   - From these 25 empty pens, he can create new pens. Since it takes 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, we calculate how many new pens he can make:
     \[
     \text{New pens from 25 empty pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
     \]

4. **Total Pens After First Round**: After creating the 5 new pens, Ram now has:
   \[
   25 \text{ (initial pens)} + 5 \text{ (new pens)} = 30 \text{ pens}
   \]

5. **Using the New Pens**: Ram will use these 5 new pens, which will also become empty. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens.

6. **Creating More New Pens**:
   - From these 5 empty pens, he can create:
     \[
     \text{New pens from 5 empty pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}

   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age**: The problem also states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:

1. **Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide:**
   Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. 

   To find 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
   \]

   Now, we subtract this from Mitchel's total:
   \[
   \text{Anne's times} = 30 - 9 = 21
   \]

2. **Calculate how many times Robert went down the slide:**
   Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

   So, we multiply Anne's total by 4:
   \[
   \text{Robert's times} = 4 \times 21 = 84

\]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows he puts in each stall, we divide the 40 cows by the 20 stalls:

\[
\frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall}

1. **Calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree**:
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height of the tree}}{\text{Height of each section}} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the tree before termites**:
   Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \times 400 \text{ pounds} = 8000 \text{ pounds}

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[
   A_a = J_a + 8
   \]
   where \( A_a \) is the number of apples Andrea has.

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[
   A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b
   \]
   where \( A_b \) is the number of bananas Andrea has.

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[
   J_b = J_a + 4
   \]

We know from the problem that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[
A_a = 52
\]

Using the first equation, we can find Jamal's apples:
\[
52 = J_a + 8 \implies J_a = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

Now we can find Jamal's bananas using the third equation:
\[
J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
\]

Next, we can find Andrea's bananas using the second equation:
\[
A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas:
  \[
  A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200
   \]
   So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

2. **Convert the number of pennies to dollars:**

275,"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given for each part: the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.

1. **Solo Song**: 
   - The solo song has 54 lines. 
   - Therefore, Sean has to memorize 54 lines from the song.

2. **First Scene**: 
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. 
   - So, the total number of lines in the first scene is \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines. 
   - Therefore, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene**: 
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. 
   - Thus, the total number of lines in the second scene is \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines. 
   - Therefore, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

Now, we can sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Lines from the solo song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Calculating the total:

\[
54 + 36 + 48 = 138

1. **Time for small holes**:
   - Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Number of small holes = 30
   - Total time for small holes = 30 holes × 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes

2. **Time for large holes**:
   - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = 15 holes × 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes

3. **Total time**:
   - Total time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. **Convert minutes to hours**:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert 240 minutes to hours:

2. In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 and Marco will be R + 10, where M and R are their current ages.
3. The new sum of their ages in 10 years will be (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20.

Since M + R = 20, we can substitute that into the equation:

M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( x + 9 \) and Ruby's age will be \( 6x + 9 \).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can set up the equation:

\[
6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[
6x - 3x + 9 = 27

This simplifies to:

\[
3x + 9 = 27
\]

Now, subtract 9 from both sides:

\[

Let \( x \) be the number of spots on a mamba. According to the problem, we have:

\[
70 = 2x
\]

To find \( x \), we can divide both sides by 2:

Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:

\[
\text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we know that the total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find out how much length is left for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

\[
\text{Remaining length for sterling silver beads} = 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
\]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, which can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Length of each sterling silver bead} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch}
\]

To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina can fit into the remaining 17 inches, we divide the remaining length by the length of each bead:

\[

1. **Sales on the weekend**: Sam sold 20 crates.
2. **Sales on Tuesday**: He sold 15 crates.
3. **Sales on Wednesday**: He sold 12 crates.
4. **Sales on Thursday**: He sold 18 crates.

Now, we can add these amounts together to find the total sales for the week:

\[
\text{Total sales} = \text{Weekend sales} + \text{Tuesday sales} + \text{Wednesday sales} + \text{Thursday sales}
\]
\[
\text{Total sales} = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18

\]

Next, we compare this total to Sam's target of 120 crates:

\[
\text{Difference from target} = \text{Target} - \text{Total sales}
\]
\[
\text{Difference from target} = 120 - 65

1. **Calculate the total miles driven per day:**
   - John travels to work and back, which is 30 miles each way.
   - Total miles per day = 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles driven per week:**
   - John works 5 days a week.
   - Total miles per week = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles.

3. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**
   - John works for 50 weeks a year.
   - Total miles per year = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.

4. **Calculate the cost of driving per year:**

301,"To determine how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand how pages are arranged when a single piece of paper is folded.

When a single sheet of paper is folded in half, it creates 4 pages. The arrangement of the pages on the folded sheet is as follows:

- The left side of the folded sheet (when folded) shows the front and back pages:
  - Left front: Page 2
  - Left back: Page 1

- The right side of the folded sheet shows the front and back pages:
  - Right front: Page 31
  - Right back: Page 32

Thus, each folded sheet contributes 4 pages to the total count. 

To find out how many sheets are needed for 32 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per sheet:

\[
\text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8

After spending $25 on food and snacks, we can find out how much money she has left:

\[
\text{Remaining amount after food and snacks} = 50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Annika spent an additional $10 on rides. We subtract this amount from her remaining balance:

303,"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in each year.

1. **Total Books**: Elise has a collection of 250 books.
2. **Unsold Books**: There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. **Books Sold This Year**: Elise sold 45 books this year.

From the total number of books and the unsold books, we can calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:

\[
\text{Total Sold} = \text{Total Books} - \text{Unsold Books} = 250 - 50 = 200
\]

Now, we know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Let \( x \) be the number of books sold this year (which is 45). Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:

\[
\text{Books Sold in First Year} = 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90
\]

Now we can find the number of books sold in the second year. Since the total number of books sold over the three years is 200, we can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Books Sold in First Year} + \text{Books Sold in Second Year} + \text{Books Sold in Current Year} = 200
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
90 + \text{Books Sold in Second Year} + 45 = 200
\]

Now, simplify this equation:

\[
\text{Books Sold in Second Year} + 135 = 200
\]

Subtract 135 from both sides:

\[
\text{Books Sold in Second Year} = 200 - 135 = 65
\]

Now that we know Elise sold 65 books in the second year, we can calculate the total amount of money she earned from those sales. Each book sells for $20, so:

\[
\text{Earnings in Second Year} = \text{Books Sold in Second Year} \times \text{Price per Book} = 65 \times 20 = 1300

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from hourly wage:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours worked in a week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

2. **Add the weekly bonus:**
   - Watson receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
   - Total weekly earnings including the bonus = $500 (from hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800/week.

3. **Calculate the number of weeks in April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - Since April starts on a specific day, we can determine the number of complete weeks. April typically has 4 complete weeks and 2 extra days.
   - Therefore, there are 4 full weeks in April.

4. **Calculate total earnings for April:**
   - Total earnings for April = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200.

John arm wrestles a total of 20 people and beats 80% of them. To calculate the number of people he beat, we can use the following formula:

Number of people beaten = Total number of people × Percentage beaten

Substituting the values:

Number of people beaten = 20 × 0.80 = 16

Now, to find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so to find out how much he loses in one week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

\[
\text{Weight lost by Joey in one week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose those 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in 4 weeks (which is 8 pounds), we can calculate:

\[
\text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks, we can find out how many 4-week periods it will take her to lose 8 pounds:

\[
\text{Number of 4-week periods} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per 4 weeks}} = 4 \text{ periods}
\]

Since each period is 4 weeks, we multiply the number of periods by the duration of each period:

\[
\text{Total weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ periods} \times 4 \text{ weeks per period} = 16 \text{ weeks}

3. Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \).
4. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we have the equation:

2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \).

Now, we can express the total number of team members in terms of \( d \):
\[
\text{Total members} = \text{Offense} + \text{Defense} + \text{Special Teams}

Substituting the expressions we have:
\[

Now, let's combine the terms on the right side:
\[
105 = 2d + d + \frac{d}{2} = 3d + \frac{d}{2}
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{d}{2} \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction with a denominator of 2:
\[
3d = \frac{6d}{2}

319,"To solve the problem, we start with the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Let’s denote the number of electric poles as \( P \) and the number of electric wires as \( W \). According to the ratio, we can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

From this ratio, we can also express the number of electric wires in terms of the number of electric poles:

\[
W = 3P
\]

We are given that the total number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. We can substitute this value into the equation:

\[
45 = 3P
\]

To find \( P \), we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

1. **Calculate Jam's total pencils:**
   - Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils.
   - We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. Since we know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils}
     \]
     Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Then:
     \[
     3x + 2 = 26
     \]
     Subtracting 2 from both sides gives:
     \[
     3x = 24
     \]
     Dividing by 3 gives:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, each box contains 8 pencils.

2. **Calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:**
   - Jam has 3 boxes of 8 pencils each and 2 loose pencils:
     \[
     3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26
     \]
   - This confirms that Jam has 26 pencils.

3. **Calculate Meg's total pencils:**
   - Meg has 46 pencils.

4. **Calculate the total number of pencils for both Jam and Meg:**
   \[
   \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72

323,"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the effect of the ice cubes and the effect of the cream.

1. **Cooling with Ice Cubes**:
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we can use the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling needed}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the ice cubes is:

   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

2. **Adding Cream**:
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to her iced coffee. Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, we consider the cream as contributing to the weakening as well. The cream itself makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

3. **Total Weakening**:
   Now, we can combine the weakening effects from the ice cubes and the cream:

   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls. Out of these 3 balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 gets lost completely. 

So, after dropping 3 balls, he originally had 6 balls, and now he has:

6 (original balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 3 balls remaining.

Thus, when Josh starts to juggle on stage, he has 3 balls.

The choir has a total of 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the choir is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls were able to perform. It is stated that half of the people performing could not make it to the show. Since only the female members are performing, we calculate half of the girls:

\[
\text{Girls who could not make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Thus, the number of girls who could perform is:

\[
\text{Girls who could perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

In addition to the girls, the choir has 3 teachers who decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total performers} = \text{Girls who could perform} + \text{Teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16

1. **Cost of Netflix**: 
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**: 
   - Normally, Hulu costs $10 and Disney Plus costs $10, so together they would cost $20.
   - However, Tim saves 20% by bundling these two services. 
   - The savings can be calculated as:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he walked:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
3. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he has taken so far is:
   \[
   5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
4. After his jog, he realized he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that before his jog, he had:
   \[
   10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
5. Since he had already taken 6,000 steps before his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog can be calculated as:
   \[
   8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}

\[
\text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words}
\]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Given that he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, we can calculate the time taken to read the book:

\[
\text{Time to read} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Reading rate}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we know that Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes. However, he needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the time he has left after reading the book is:

\[
\text{Time left after reading} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, we can find out how early he will arrive at the airport by subtracting the reading time from the time left:

\[
\text{Early arrival time} = \text{Time left after reading} - \text{Time to read} = 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}

**Step 1: Calculate the payment for May.**

In May, the company hired 40 employees, and each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

First, we calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[
\text{Weekly payment per employee} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours} = 600 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total payment for all 40 employees in May:
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 40 = 24000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the payment for June.**

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees who continued working in June is:
\[
\text{Number of employees in June} = 40 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 40\right) = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

The payment for June for the remaining 30 employees is calculated similarly:
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees in June} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 30 = 18000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**

Now, we add the total payments for May and June:
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} + 18000 \, \text{dollars} = 42000 \, \text{dollars}

1. The first pound of taffy costs $3.
2. The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Now, we add the costs of the taffy:
- Total cost of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:
- Cost of seashells = $1.50.

Now, we calculate the cost of the magnets:
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets.
- Total cost of magnets = 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add all the costs together:
- Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
- Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. Now we subtract the total cost from the amount she had:

   - Among the candles that are at risk of exploding (the 1%), 5% of those have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. **Calculating the number of candles that might explode**:
   - Total candles = 50,000
   - Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
   - Number of candles that might explode = 1% of 50,000 = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles.

3. **Calculating the number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog**:
   - Among the 500 candles that might explode, 5% smell like wet dog.

- She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:

Now, let's analyze the apples gathered by her sister:
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.

3. The total number of heads (which is the total number of animals) is 180.
4. The total number of humps is 304.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. The equation for the total number of heads:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The equation for the total number of humps:
   \[
   2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system step by step. First, we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( D \):

\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2C - C = 304 - 180
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C \), we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find \( D \):

\[
124 + D = 180

\[
D = 180 - 124

428,"To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we first need to calculate how many hotdogs the caterer prepared.

The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them (which is 18 guests) expected to eat two hotdogs. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is:

\[
\text{Total hotdogs prepared} = 18 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs/guest} + 18 \text{ guests} \times 1 \text{ hotdog/guest} = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Now, 40 guests showed up, and each of them wanted a second hotdog. This means that the total number of hotdogs needed for all guests is:

\[
\text{Total hotdogs needed} = 40 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hotdogs/guest} = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Now we compare the number of hotdogs prepared (54) with the number of hotdogs needed (80). The difference will tell us how many guests did not get a second hotdog:

\[
\text{Shortfall of hotdogs} = 80 \text{ hotdogs needed} - 54 \text{ hotdogs prepared} = 26 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Since each of the 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, and there are 26 hotdogs short, we can find out how many guests did not get their second hotdog. Since each guest who wanted a second hotdog could not get one due to the shortfall, we can calculate how many guests were affected:

\[
\text{Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog} = 26

1. **Cost of the pot and pans**: $120.00
2. **Cost of the mixing bowls**: $20.00
3. **Cost of the utensils**: She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so:
   \[

2. **Money Left**: He had 1% of his money left after spending. To find out how much that is:
   \[
   1\% \text{ of } 500 \text{ cents} = \frac{1}{100} \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Total Money Spent on Chips and Candy Bars**: Since he had 5 cents left, the amount he spent is:

From the problem, we know:
- \( W = 4 \) minutes (the time it takes Wayne to be driven to the theater).
- The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, so \( B = 4W \).

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[
B = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, if Wayne arrives at the theater at \( W \) minutes, Bernadette should arrive at:
\[
W - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1 \text{ minutes}
\]
This means Bernadette should arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

Now, we need to calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave:
\[
\text{Time to leave} = \text{Arrival time} - \text{Travel time} = (W - 5) - B

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of the super ticket: $20
   - Cost of popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: 
     \[
     20 + 1 = 21
     \]

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of the regular movie ticket: $12
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Let \( p \) be the regular price of popcorn.
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option:
     \[
     12 + 3 + p = 15 + p
     \]

According to the problem, by choosing the regular ticket option, you saved $2 compared to the super ticket option. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
15 + p + 2 = 21
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
15 + p = 21 - 2
\]
\[
15 + p = 19

451,"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase.

Given that the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45
\]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + \text{Increase} = 45 + 20 = 65
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 per balloon:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
65 \times 170 = 11050

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**
   Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Substituting the dimensions:
   \[
   V = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume for all 10 raised beds:**
   Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) is:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed:**
   Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{V_{\text{total}}}{\text{volume of one bag}} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{cost per bag} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Initial Pencils Calculation**:
   Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils at the beginning is:
   \[
   \text{Total pencils} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. **Pencils Used**:
   After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used. We calculate how many pencils that is:
   \[
   \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}

473,"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is represented by the combined length of the remoras, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. 

The shark's length is given as 10 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the shark's length to inches:

\[
10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to find the combined length of the two remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, so the total length of the two remoras is:

\[
2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula for percentage is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]

In this case, the ""Part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""Whole"" is the length of the shark (120 inches):

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{12}{120} = 0.1

494,"To find the height of the human pyramid formed by the cheerleaders, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid.

1. **Identify the heights of the cheerleaders**:
   - 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
   - 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

2. **Pyramid structure**:
   - The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom layer.
   - 3 girls stand on top of the 4.
   - 2 girls stand on top of the 3.
   - The shortest girl (60 inches) is at the top.

3. **Height calculation**:
   - The height of each layer of the pyramid is determined by the height of the cheerleaders standing on that layer.
   - The bottom layer (4 girls) will be 64 inches tall.
   - The second layer (3 girls) will also be 64 inches tall.
   - The third layer (2 girls) will again be 64 inches tall.
   - The top layer (1 girl) will be 60 inches tall.

4. **Total height of the pyramid**:
   - The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of each layer:
     - Height of the bottom layer: 64 inches
     - Height of the second layer: 64 inches
     - Height of the third layer: 64 inches
     - Height of the top layer: 60 inches

   Therefore, the total height in inches is:
   \[
   64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert inches to feet**:
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so we convert the total height from inches to feet:
   \[
   \frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ feet}

First, we need to determine how many hours she works in a week. Since she works 5 days a week, we calculate:

\[
\text{Total hours worked in a week} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find out how many 5-minute walking breaks she takes in those 40 hours. Since she takes a break every hour, she will take a break for each of the 8 hours she works each day. Therefore, in 5 days, she will take:

\[
\text{Total breaks} = 8 \text{ breaks/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ breaks}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time she spends walking. Each break lasts 5 minutes, so:

\[
\text{Total walking time} = 40 \text{ breaks} \times 5 \text{ minutes/break} = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of insects collected by all three is 43:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43

Now, subtract 7 from both sides:
\[

Divide by 2:
\[
B = 18

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9

   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate Mariah's usage as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mariah's usage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}

1. **Cost and Production Analysis**:
   - A **2 x 4** costs $4 and produces **200 sticks**.
   - A **2 x 8** costs $6 and produces **400 sticks**.

2. **Cost per Stick Calculation**:
   - For the **2 x 4**:
     - Cost per stick = Cost of wood / Number of sticks = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
   - For the **2 x 8**:
     - Cost per stick = Cost of wood / Number of sticks = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

From this analysis, we see that the **2 x 8** is cheaper per stick.

3. **Maximizing Sticks with Budget**:
   - Let's see how many **2 x 8** pieces Frederick can buy with $24:
     - Each **2 x 8** costs $6.
     - Number of **2 x 8** pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces.
     - Total sticks from 4 pieces of **2 x 8** = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

4. **Checking Other Combinations**:
   - If Frederick buys only **2 x 4** pieces:
     - Number of **2 x 4** pieces he can buy = $24 / $4 = 6 pieces.
     - Total sticks from 6 pieces of **2 x 4** = 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.
   - If he mixes the two types, we can check combinations, but since the **2 x 8** gives more sticks for less cost, it is unlikely to yield a better result than buying all **2 x 8**.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The best option for Frederick is to buy 4 pieces of **2 x 8**, yielding a total of 1600 popsicle sticks.

A fight lasts for 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. Therefore, the total duration of the fight is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of rounds} \times \text{Duration of each round} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we know that Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute. To find the total number of punches he throws during the entire fight, we multiply the total time by the number of punches he throws per minute:

\[
\text{Total punches} = \text{Total time} \times \text{Punches per minute} = 15 \times 25

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills: \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \) dollars

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total money Ali has:

\[
40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister:

\[
\text{Amount given to sister} = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

\[
\text{Amount spent on dinner} = \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate how much money Ali has left after buying dinner:

2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
   \[
   C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66

Current age of Jame = 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Next, we need to find out the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years. Let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as \( C \).

In 8 years, Jame will be:
Current age of Jame + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, we can express this relationship mathematically:

Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 * (Jame's age in 8 years) - 5
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Now, we can express the cousin's age in terms of his current age \( C \):

Cousin's age in 8 years = Current age of cousin + 8 = C + 8.

Setting the two expressions for the cousin's age in 8 years equal to each other gives us:

C + 8 = 55.

Now, we can solve for \( C \):

C = 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now we have both Jame's current age and his cousin's current age:

- Jame's current age = 22 years old.
- Cousin's current age = 47 years old.

To find the difference in their ages, we subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age:

Age difference = Cousin's age - Jame's age = 47 - 22 = 25 years.

   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2400 = 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of One Monitor}

2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the thickness of the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now we can sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
\text{Total thickness} = \text{Thickness of first book} + \text{Thickness of second book} + \text{Thickness of third book} + \text{Thickness of fourth book}
\]
\[
\text{Total thickness} = 31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
- First, add the thickness of the first and second books:
  \[
  31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} = 81 \text{ mm}
  \]
- Next, add the thickness of the third book:
  \[
  81 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} = 126 \text{ mm}
  \]
- Finally, add the thickness of the fourth book:
  \[
  126 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
  \]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

538,"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. **Calculate the total vlogs made in the first three weeks:**
   - Vlogs in the first week: 18
   - Vlogs in the second week: 21
   - Vlogs in the third week: 15

   Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

2. **Determine how many vlogs are left to reach 72:**

   \]
   So, each boy starts with $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Transactions**:
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:

541,"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down his savings plan.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days, and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first half (the first 15 days), he saves:

\[
15x
\]

In the second half of the month, he wants to save twice as much daily, which means he saves \( 2x \) each day. Thus, in the second half (the last 15 days), he saves:

\[
15(2x) = 30x
\]

Now, we can express his total savings for the month as the sum of his savings from both halves:

\[
\text{Total savings} = 15x + 30x = 45x
\]

We know that his total savings target for the month is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
45x = 1125
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:

\[
x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half of the month:

\[
2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

Thus, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

561,"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine the weights of each individual.

1. **Mark's weight**: Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. **Susan's weight**: Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Therefore, we calculate Susan's weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. **Bob's weight**: Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Thus, we calculate Bob's weight as follows:
   \[
   \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

Next, we calculate the average weight of the three friends. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of friends (which is 3).

4. **Total weight**:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}

581,"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we first need to convert the lengths of each movie into minutes.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. 
   - Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we convert the first movie's length:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the total length of the first movie in minutes is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - Again, we convert the hours to minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Thus, the total length of the second movie in minutes is:
   \[
   120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add the lengths of both movies together to find the total time Max will spend watching them:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:

1. **Calculate the original cost of two boxes:**
   Each box costs $100.00, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 boxes} = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 200 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   Subtract the discount from the original cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 200 - 20 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of contacts:**
   Each box contains 90 contacts, so:
   \[
   \text{Total contacts in 2 boxes} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ contacts}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost per contact:**
   To find the cost per contact, divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
   \[
   \text{Cost per contact} = \frac{180}{180} = 1 \text{ dollar}

**Step 1: Calculate Jill's earnings.**
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.
- Jill's earnings = Total hours worked × Rate per hour = 3 hours × $10/hour = $30.

**Step 2: Calculate John's hours worked.**
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday.
  - Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday, so John worked 2 × 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday.
  - Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday, so John worked 3 × 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 hours (Saturday) + 3 hours (Sunday) = 7 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate John's earnings.**
- John's earnings = Total hours worked × Rate per hour = 7 hours × $10/hour = $70.

We can express these relationships mathematically:

1. The number of red jelly beans:
   \[
   r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
   \]

2. The number of green jelly beans:
   \[
   g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
   \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of jelly beans:
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \) into the total:
\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]
\[
3.01b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):
\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01} \approx 1498.34
\]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we round \( b \) to the nearest whole number, which is 1498.

Now we can find \( r \) and \( g \):
1. Calculate \( r \):
   \[
   r = 0.99 \times 1498 \approx 1483.02 \quad \text{(round to 1483)}

1. **Initial height of the beanstalk**: 4 feet
2. **Height of Mark's window**: 20 feet
3. **Doubling process**: The height of the beanstalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Height after } n \text{ days} = 4 \times 2^n
   \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

4. **Dividing both sides by 4**:
   \[
   2^n > 5

5. **Finding \( n \)**: We can solve for \( n \) by taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:
   \[
   n > \log_2(5)

Using the change of base formula, we can calculate \( \log_2(5) \):
\[
\log_2(5) = \frac{\log_{10}(5)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.6990}{0.3010} \approx 2.3219

602,"To determine how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to calculate the speed of the plane.

The speed can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

From the problem, the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we know the speed, we can find out how long it would take to travel the additional 2000 miles. We can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

The directions state that 2 pumps provide 120 washings. Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get:

\[
\text{Number of washes} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes}
\]

Now, we know the total cost of the jumbo bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:

\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{60 \text{ washes}} = 0.40 \text{ dollars per wash}
\]

Next, since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash, which is $0.40. To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.40 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 40 \text{ cents}

\[
\text{Initial funding} = 100,000
\]

After the first 5 months, John realizes that his research will take 10 times longer than initially planned. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:

\[
\text{Total duration} = 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months}
\]

This means that there are an additional:

\[
\text{Additional months} = 50 \text{ months} - 5 \text{ months} = 45 \text{ months}
\]

For each of these additional months, the funding required increases by 50% compared to the previous month. To calculate the funding for these additional months, we first need to determine the funding for the 6th month.

The funding for the 6th month is:

\[
\text{Funding for month 6} = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
\]

Now, we can calculate the funding for each subsequent month, where each month is 50% more than the previous month. This forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 150,000 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

The funding for the \( n \)-th month can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Funding for month } n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^{n-5}
\]

We need to calculate the total funding for the months from 6 to 50 (which is 45 months). The total funding for these months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
\]

Where:
- \( a = 150,000 \)
- \( r = 1.5 \)
- \( n = 45 \)

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[
S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5}
\]

Calculating \( (1.5)^{45} \) is a large number, but we can compute the sum:

\[
S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5} = -300,000 (1 - (1.5)^{45})
\]

Now, we need to find \( (1.5)^{45} \). This is a very large number, and for practical purposes, we can use a calculator or computational tool to find it. 

Assuming \( (1.5)^{45} \) is approximately \( 7.6 \times 10^6 \):

\[
S_{45} \approx -300,000 (1 - 7.6 \times 10^6) \approx -300,000 (-7.6 \times 10^6) \approx 2.28 \times 10^9
\]

Now, we add the initial funding of $100,000 to this total:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 100,000 + S_{45} \approx 100,000 + 2.28 \times 10^9 \approx 2.28 \times 10^9
\]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately:

\[

1. **Initial amount of gum**: Jim starts with a 20 pack of gum.

2. **Gum chewed during school**: Jim is at school for 8 hours. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. Therefore, the number of pieces he chews during school is:
   \[
   \text{Pieces chewed at school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum chewed on the way home**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum chewed after dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Total gum chewed**: Now we can calculate the total pieces of gum Jim chews throughout the day:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces chewed} = \text{Pieces chewed at school} + \text{Piece on the way home} + \text{Piece after dinner}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces}

635,"Manny signed up for Karate classes that cost a total of $60 for 10 classes. To find out how much each class costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of classes:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

This means each class costs $6. His parents have set a limit that if the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Since $6 is less than $10, he can miss some classes without exceeding the $10 per class threshold.

Now, let's denote the number of classes Manny misses as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, then he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost remains $60, but the cost per attended class will change based on how many classes he actually attends:

\[
\text{New cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of attended classes}} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the new cost per class does not exceed $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve this inequality, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x \) must be positive, which means \( x < 10 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
10x \leq 100 - 60
\]
\[
10x \leq 40
\]
\[
x \leq 4
\]

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 4 classes, he will attend 6 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

If he misses 5 classes, he will attend 5 classes, and the cost per class will be:

\[
\frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

Since $12 exceeds $10, he cannot miss 5 classes. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss while still keeping the cost per class at $10 or below is 4.

1. **Cost of the suits**:
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = Number of suits × Cost per suit = 10 × 750 = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants**:
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of each dress pant = 1/5 × 750 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = Number of dress pants × Cost per dress pant = 10 × 150 = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts**:
   - James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit.
   - Total number of dress shirts = Number of suits × Shirts per suit = 10 × 3 = 30 shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = Number of shirts × Cost per shirt = 30 × 60 = $1800.

Now, we can sum up all the costs:

- Total cost for suits = $7500
- Total cost for dress pants = $1500
- Total cost for dress shirts = $1800

Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
Total cost = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = $10800.

1. **Digging through soil:**
   - Bill digs through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - The time taken to dig through the soil can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - Therefore, the time to dig through the soil is:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Digging through clay:**
   - Bill digs through clay at half the speed of digging through soil, which is 2 feet per hour (since half of 4 feet/hour is 2 feet/hour).
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - The time taken to dig through the clay is:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}

651,"Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as \( G \).

According to the problem, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half of the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
400 = \frac{1}{2} G
\]

To find \( G \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
G = 400 \times 2 = 800
\]

Now we know that in the first month, Ariadne's total sales (from both red and green hats) were:

\[
\text{Total sales in the first month} = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200

2. Each animal has 1 head. The total number of heads is 20.

We can write the following equations based on this information:

Now we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[

Expanding this gives:

- Let \( R \) be the amount of money Rayna has.
- Let \( K \) be the amount of money Kassidy has.
- Let \( A \) be the amount of money Aurelia has.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy:
   \[
   R = K + 60
   \]

2. Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia:
   \[
   K = \frac{3}{4} A
   \]

3. Aurelia has $120:
   \[
   A = 120
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) into the equation for \( K \):
\[
K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Next, we can substitute \( K \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[
R = K + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150
\]

Now we have the amounts for each person:
- Aurelia has \( A = 120 \)
- Kassidy has \( K = 90 \)
- Rayna has \( R = 150 \)

Next, we need to find the total amount of money they have together:
\[

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max:
   \[

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
   \[

We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
\[

Using the first equation, we can find Max's cookies:
\[
68 = M - 5

Adding 5 to both sides gives:
\[
M = 68 + 5 = 73

Now we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies using the second equation:

Substituting \( M = 73 \):

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total length of the dress after the extension and the addition of the lace trim can be expressed as:

687,"Let's denote the ages of the twins as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), and the ages of the triplets as \( R_1 \), \( R_2 \), and \( R_3 \).

From the problem, we know the following:

1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Let's assume \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of all the children is 44, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   T_1 + T_2 + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
   \]

Since \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are twins, we can say \( T_1 = T_2 \). Let's denote their age as \( T \). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
T + T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
\]
or
\[
2T + R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
\]

Now, since \( T_1 = R_1 + 7 \), we can substitute \( T \) for \( T_1 \):
\[
T = R_1 + 7
\]
This means \( R_1 = T - 7 \).

Now we can substitute \( R_1 \) back into the combined ages equation:
\[
2T + (T - 7) + R_2 + R_3 = 44
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2T + T - 7 + R_2 + R_3 = 44
\]
or
\[
3T + R_2 + R_3 = 51
\]

Since \( R_2 \) and \( R_3 \) are also triplets, we can assume they are the same age. Let's denote their age as \( R \). Thus, we have:
\[
3T + 2R = 51
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( T = R_1 + 7 \)
2. \( 3T + 2R = 51 \)

We can express \( R \) in terms of \( T \) from the second equation:
\[
2R = 51 - 3T
\]
\[
R = \frac{51 - 3T}{2}
\]

Now we can substitute \( R \) back into the first equation:
Since \( R_1 = T - 7 \), we can find \( R \) using the relationship between \( T \) and \( R_1 \).

To find a solution, we can try different values for \( T \) and see if they yield integer values for \( R \).

Let's try \( T = 17 \):
\[
R = \frac{51 - 3(17)}{2} = \frac{51 - 51}{2} = 0
\]
This is not valid since ages cannot be negative.

Now let's try \( T = 16 \):
\[
R = \frac{51 - 3(16)}{2} = \frac{51 - 48}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
This is also not valid.

Now let's try \( T = 15 \):
\[
R = \frac{51 - 3(15)}{2} = \frac{51 - 45}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]
This is valid.

Now we have:
- \( T = 15 \) (age of each twin)
- \( R_1 = T - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8 \) (age of one triplet)
- \( R_2 = R_3 = 3 \) (ages of the other triplets)

Now we can check the total:
\[
15 + 15 + 8 + 3 + 3 = 44
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the age of one of the twins is \( 15 \).

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes.

Next, we will calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Now, we add these times together:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes of homework.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time available before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

689,"Let's start by determining the cost of the candies. 

Manolo bought five lollipops at $0.40 each. The total cost for the lollipops is:
\[
5 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we know that the total cost for five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. We can set up the equation to find the total cost of the candies:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of lollipops} + \text{Cost of candies}
\]
\[
3.20 = 2.00 + \text{Cost of candies}
\]

To find the cost of the candies, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:
\[
\text{Cost of candies} = 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Manolo bought four candies, we can find the cost of each candy:
\[
\text{Cost of each candy} = \frac{1.20 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ candies}} = 0.30 \text{ dollars/candy}
\]

Now we know the cost of each lollipop is $0.40 and the cost of each candy is $0.30. 

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[
\text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} + \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 vaccines × $20/vaccine = $40.

2. **Let the total bill be represented as \( T \).**
   - According to the problem, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill.
   - Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check = 0.60 × \( T \).

3. **The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:**
   \[
   T = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
   \]
   \[
   T = 40 + 0.60T
   \]

4. **Now, we can solve for \( T \):**
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   T - 0.60T = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.40T = 40
   \]
   \[
   T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100

1. **Price of an apple**: 
   - Given that one apple costs $0.5.

2. **Price of a banana**: 
   - It is stated that one banana costs twice as much as one apple. 
   - Therefore, the price of a banana is:
     \[
     \text{Price of a banana} = 2 \times \text{Price of an apple} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0
     \]

3. **Price of an orange**: 
   - It is mentioned that one orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - Thus, the price of an orange is:
     \[
     \text{Price of an orange} = 3 \times \text{Price of a banana} = 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0
     \]

Now we have the prices:
- Price of an apple = $0.5
- Price of a banana = $1.0
- Price of an orange = $3.0

Next, we calculate the total price of one crate, which consists of:
- 5 bananas
- 12 apples
- 7 oranges

The total price for the crate can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total price} = (\text{Number of bananas} \times \text{Price of a banana}) + (\text{Number of apples} \times \text{Price of an apple}) + (\text{Number of oranges} \times \text{Price of an orange})

- For bananas: \(5 \times 1.0 = 5.0\)
- For apples: \(12 \times 0.5 = 6.0\)
- For oranges: \(7 \times 3.0 = 21.0\)

Now, summing these amounts:

706,"To determine how many total hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300, we first need to find out how much more money they need after the first 3 hours.

They have already raised $2100, so we subtract this amount from their goal:

\[
6300 - 2100 = 4200
\]

This means they still need to raise $4200.

Next, we need to find out how much they are raising per hour. Since they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can calculate the amount raised per hour by dividing the total amount raised by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700
\]

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200. We can do this by dividing the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[
\text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6
\]

Now, we add the additional hours needed to the initial 3 hours they have already worked:

\[
\text{Total hours needed} = 3 + 6 = 9

1. **Determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City**: Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of that water used for industrial purposes**: Out of the 40% used by Colorado City, 80% is for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes**:
   \[

The deal states that if you buy 2 scoops of ice cream, you get 1 scoop free. This means that for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin will receive a total of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free).

The cost of each scoop is $1.50. Therefore, the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[

Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. We know that:
- 1 foot = 12 inches

So, we convert 8 feet to inches:
8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches

Now, we add the additional 4 inches:
Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Next, we know from the problem statement that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically. Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem:

\[
\text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9b + 10
\]

We already calculated the length of Topher's shoe to be 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
100 = 9b + 10
\]

Now, we will solve for \( b \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
100 - 10 = 9b
\]
\[
90 = 9b
\]

2. Divide both sides by 9:
\[
b = \frac{90}{9} = 10

1. **Count the total number of spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. **Count the total number of blue spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. **Calculate the percentage of blue spools:**
   To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Simplifying the fraction:

   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4

   Substituting Dora's age:
   \[
   \text{Father's Age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

Now, we can sum up the weights of all the books:

- Weight of math and science books: \( 2n \)
- Weight of the French book: \( 4 \)
- Weight of the English book: \( 3 \)
- Weight of the history book: \( 6 \)

The total weight of all the books is:

Since we do not have a specific value for \( n \) (the number of math and science books), we cannot calculate a specific total weight. However, we can express the total weight in terms of \( n \).

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \( 2n + 13 \).

If we assume she has at least one math or science book, the total weight will always be more than 13 pounds.

Now, we can substitute \( x \) and \( z \) in terms of \( y \) into the total equation.

From the first equation, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 2x
\]

Now substituting \( y \) into the total equation:
\[
x + 2x + z = 250

771,"First, we need to calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so we can calculate the total revenue from the eggplants as follows:

\[
\text{Revenue from eggplants} = \text{Number of eggplants} \times \text{Price per eggplant} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling corn, we subtract the revenue from the eggplants from the total amount he wants to make:

\[
\text{Amount needed from corn} = \text{Total desired revenue} - \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn by the number of ears of corn:

\[
\text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\text{Amount needed from corn}}{\text{Number of ears of corn}} = \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

780,"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B + 3 \) berries. 

The scoring system is as follows:
- Points for jumping on enemies: 10 points per enemy.
- Points for collecting berries: 5 points per berry.
- Points for time left on the timer: 30 points per second left.

Let’s denote the time left for Emma as \( T \) seconds. Therefore, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so her time left is \( T - 4 \) seconds.

Now we can calculate the scores for both players:

**Emma's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from time: \( 30T \)

So, Emma's total score \( S_E \) is:
\[
S_E = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

**Ava's score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \)

So, Ava's total score \( S_A \) is:
\[
S_A = (10E + 80) + (5B + 15) + (30T - 120)
\]
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

Now, we can find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
S_A - S_E = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]
\[
S_A - S_E = -25

Thus, the difference between their scores is \( -25 \), meaning Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[
3 + x = 2(4 + y)
\]

We also know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, which gives us another equation:

\[
x + y = 17
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \)
2. \( x + y = 17 \)

Let's simplify the first equation:

\[
3 + x = 8 + 2y
\]
\[
x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now we can use the second equation \( x + y = 17 \) to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 17 - y \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
(17 - y) - 2y = 5
\]
\[
17 - 3y = 5
\]
\[
-3y = 5 - 17
\]
\[
-3y = -12
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) using Equation 2:

\[
x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
\]

Thus, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish.

To summarize:
- Bob bought 4 white fish.

793,"To calculate Jamie's pay for last Tuesday, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
2. **Overtime Hours**: Any hours worked beyond 8 hours are considered overtime. Jamie's overtime pay is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the first 8 hours:

\[
\text{Regular Pay} = \text{Regular Hourly Rate} \times \text{Regular Hours} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 160 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how many hours she worked beyond the regular 8 hours. Since she worked 11 hours total:

\[
\text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours} - \text{Regular Hours} = 11 \, \text{hours} - 8 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, we calculate her overtime pay. The overtime rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate:

\[
\text{Overtime Rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Regular Hourly Rate} = 1.5 \times 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour}
\]

Now we can calculate her pay for the overtime hours:

\[
\text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Rate} \times \text{Overtime Hours} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total pay for the day:

\[
\text{Total Pay} = \text{Regular Pay} + \text{Overtime Pay} = 160 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, Jamie was paid a total of 250 dollars for her work last Tuesday.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Calculating the total number of stuffed animals:

\[
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the new total number of stuffed animals will be:

\[
14 + x
\]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x = 0.3(14 + x)
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Distribute the 0.3 on the right side:

\[
x = 0.3 \times 14 + 0.3x
\]

2. Calculate \( 0.3 \times 14 \):

\[
0.3 \times 14 = 4.2
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x = 4.2 + 0.3x
\]

3. To isolate \( x \), subtract \( 0.3x \) from both sides:

\[
x - 0.3x = 4.2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0.7x = 4.2
\]

4. Now, divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{4.2}{0.7} = 6

Total branches climbed = 420

Now that we know Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week, we can find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total branches by 7:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7

Now we perform the division:

Average branches per day = 60

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60.

1. **Calculating petals for each type of flower:**
   - For the first type: Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
     \[
     3 \text{ flowers} \times 5 \text{ petals/flower} = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the second type: Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
     \[
     4 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ petals/flower} = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the third type: Rose picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
     \[
     5 \text{ flowers} \times 4 \text{ petals/flower} = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - For the fourth type: Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
     \[
     6 \text{ flowers} \times 7 \text{ petals/flower} = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Total petals before dropping any flowers:**
   Now, we sum all the petals:
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Calculating petals lost:**
   Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
   - From the first type (5 petals): 1 flower lost = 5 petals lost.
   - From the second type (6 petals): 1 flower lost = 6 petals lost.
   - From the third type (4 petals): 1 flower lost = 4 petals lost.
   - From the fourth type (7 petals): 1 flower lost = 7 petals lost.

   Total petals lost:
   \[
   5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals lost}
   \]

4. **Calculating total petals in the vase:**
   Now, we subtract the lost petals from the total petals:

813,"To determine how many S'mores John and DeSean can make with the marshmallows left in the bag, we start with the total number of marshmallows and account for the ones used and lost.

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9 S'mores, which means he used 9 marshmallows.
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9 S'mores, which means he used 9 marshmallows as well.
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3 marshmallows.

Now, we calculate the total marshmallows used and lost:

- Total marshmallows used by both John and DeSean: 
  \[
  9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows}
  \]

- Total marshmallows lost: 
  \[
  3 \text{ marshmallows}
  \]

Now, we add the marshmallows used and lost together:

\[
18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows}
\]

Next, we subtract the total marshmallows used and lost from the original total:

\[
35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows left}
\]

Now, since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows left can be used to make S'mores. Since both John and DeSean can use these marshmallows, they can each make S'mores from the remaining marshmallows.

If they decide to share the remaining marshmallows equally, each kid can make:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores each}

1. **Jack's Playtime:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (which is 240 minutes), we can find out how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Friend 1's Playtime (significantly worse):**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, which means they can play for:
     \[
     \text{Playtime} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), we find out how many 10-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Friend 2's Playtime (also significantly worse):**
   - This friend has the same playtime as Friend 1, so they also play for 10 minutes per quarter.
   - Therefore, they also use:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Friend 3's Playtime (significantly better):**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which means they can play for:
     \[
     \text{Playtime} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), we find out how many 30-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}

Now, we can sum up the total number of quarters used by all players:

- Jack: 12 quarters
- Friend 1: 24 quarters
- Friend 2: 24 quarters
- Friend 3: 8 quarters

Total quarters used:
\[
\text{Total quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}

815,"Let's denote the amounts of each ingredient in ounces as follows:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( u \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( z = f \) (the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (the same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( u = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:

\[
z + f + s + u + g = 10
\]

Now, substituting the relationships into the total:

Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \):

\[
z + z + s + u + g = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2z + s + u + g = 10
\]

Since \( s = g \), we can replace \( g \) with \( s \):

\[
2z + s + u + s = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2z + 2s + u = 10
\]

Now, substituting \( u = 2s \) into the equation:

\[
2z + 2s + 2s = 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2z + 4s = 10
\]

Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives:

\[
z + 2s = 5
\]

Now, we also have the relationship \( s = 2z \). We can substitute \( s \) in the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \):

\[
z + 2(2z) = 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
z + 4z = 5
\]

So:

\[
5z = 5
\]

Thus:

\[
z = 1
\]

Now, substituting \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):

\[
s = 2z = 2(1) = 2
\]

Now, substituting \( s = 2 \) back to find \( u \):

\[
u = 2s = 2(2) = 4
\]

Now we have:

- \( z = 1 \)
- \( f = 1 \) (since \( z = f \))
- \( s = 2 \)
- \( g = 2 \) (since \( s = g \))
- \( u = 4 \)

Finally, we can check the total:

\[
z + f + s + u + g = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct.

1. **Time spent filming TikTok videos**:
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Over four weeks, the total time spent on videos is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs**:
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Converting hours to minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Over four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:

831,"To calculate the total cost for Angela's installation, we first need to determine how many additional items she has beyond what is included in the base installation price.

The base installation includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

Now, let's calculate how many additional items Angela has:

1. **Mirrors**: 
   - Angela has 6 mirrors, but the installation includes 4 mirrors.
   - Additional mirrors = 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors.

2. **Chandeliers**: 
   - Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the installation includes 1 chandelier.
   - Additional chandeliers = 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier.

3. **Pictures**: 
   - Angela has 20 pictures, but the installation includes 10 pictures.
   - Additional pictures = 20 - 10 = 10 pictures.

Now, we sum the additional items:
- Additional items = 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 additional items.

The cost for the base installation is $129.00, and the cost for the additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the cost for the additional items is:
\[
\text{Cost for additional items} = 13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base installation cost} + \text{Cost for additional items} = 129 + 195 = 324
\]

Thus, the total cost for Angela's installation will be:

1. **Determine Eva's savings**: 
   Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Calculate Anthony's savings**: 
   According to the problem, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
   \[
   \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

3. **Calculate Roy's savings**:

   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's lifting capability**: 
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Since Pompei can lift 1 inch, Saskay can lift:
     \[
     12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capability**: 
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Since Saskay can lift 12 inches, Kagiyami can lift:
     \[
     4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Naruto's lifting capability**: 
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Since Kagiyami can lift 48 inches, Naruto can lift:
     \[
     10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
     \]

Now, we need to convert Naruto's lifting capability from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the number of inches by 12:

\[
\frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12} = 40 \text{ feet}

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - The total time taken by the kangaroos is 18 hours, which means the distance they cover can be represented as:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo. Since there are 3 kangaroos, their combined speed is \( 3v \).
   - Therefore, the distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18
     \]
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).
   - The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance:**
   - We need to find the time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to cover the same distance \( D \):
     \[
     D = 2v \times t
     \]
   - We already know that \( D = 54v \), so we can set the equations equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2v \times t
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by \( v \) (assuming \( v \neq 0 \)):
     \[
     54 = 2t
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54}{2} = 27

- Let \( K \) be the number of dishes made by Kora.
- Let \( R \) be the number of dishes made by Rory.
- Let \( J \) be the number of dishes made by Jada.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, leading to the equation:
   \[
   J = 2R = 2 \times 40 = 80

837,"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can break down the information given:

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. By trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job.
4. Her mom is giving her $80.
5. After these contributions, Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has after receiving her job payment and her mom's contribution:

- Total money from her job and her mom: $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up the equation:

Total money she has (from job and mom) + money in her purse = Total cost of the laptop after trade-in.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The equation becomes:

\[ 230 + x = 400 - 50 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 230 + x = 350 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Thus, Erika has $120 in her purse.

1. **Calculate slices from large apples:**
   - Adam slices 3 large apples.
   - Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total slices from large apples is:
     \[
     3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/large apple} = 15 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Calculate slices from small apples:**
   - Adam slices 5 small apples.
   - Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total slices from small apples is:

     15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Calculate slices left after Adam eats some:**
   - Adam eats 15 slices.
   - To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total slices:

Now, we need to determine how many additional cows are required to produce this additional 10 liters of milk. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the number of additional cows needed by dividing the additional milk needed by the amount of milk produced by one cow:

\[
\text{Additional cows needed} = \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows}

849,"To determine how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs, we first need to calculate how many trays of eggs he can fill with the 900 eggs.

1. **Calculate the number of trays**:
   Each tray holds 30 eggs. Therefore, the number of trays the farmer can fill is calculated by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings**:
   The farmer sells each tray for $2.5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}

1. **Initial number of goats:**
   - Farm X: 55 goats
   - Farm Y: 45 goats

2. **Goats sold:**
   - From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
   - From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as he sold from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

3. **Calculating the remaining goats:**
   - Remaining goats in Farm X: 
     \( 55 - 10 = 45 \)
   - Remaining goats in Farm Y: 
     \( 45 - 20 = 25 \)

4. **Total remaining goats:**
   - Total remaining goats = Remaining goats in Farm X + Remaining goats in Farm Y

851,"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year as follows:

\[
\text{Total pairs of shoes per year} = 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
\]

Next, we know that James spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:

\[
\text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total pairs bought}} = \frac{2640}{24}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{2640}{24} = 110

852,"To find the total cost of the baskets of food, we first need to determine how many of each type of basket we are buying. Let's denote:

- \( g \): the number of green food baskets
- \( r \): the number of red food baskets

According to the problem, we are buying a total of 3 baskets, so we have:

\[
g + r = 3
\]

The cost of each basket of green food is $25, and the cost of each basket of red food is $18. However, for each basket of red food, we receive a discount of $2. Therefore, the effective cost of each red food basket becomes:

\[
18 - 2 = 16
\]

Now, the total cost \( C \) can be expressed as:

\[
C = 25g + 16r
\]

We can substitute \( g \) from the first equation into the cost equation. From \( g + r = 3 \), we can express \( g \) as:

\[
g = 3 - r
\]

Substituting this into the cost equation gives:

\[
C = 25(3 - r) + 16r
\]

Expanding this, we have:

\[
C = 75 - 25r + 16r
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
C = 75 - 9r
\]

Now, we need to consider the possible values for \( r \) (the number of red baskets). Since \( g + r = 3 \), \( r \) can take values 0, 1, 2, or 3. We will calculate the total cost for each case:

1. If \( r = 0 \):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(0) = 75
   \]

2. If \( r = 1 \):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(1) = 66
   \]

3. If \( r = 2 \):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(2) = 57
   \]

4. If \( r = 3 \):
   \[
   C = 75 - 9(3) = 48
   \]

Thus, the total costs for the different combinations of green and red baskets are:

- 3 green baskets: $75
- 2 green and 1 red basket: $66
- 1 green and 2 red baskets: $57
- 0 green and 3 red baskets: $48

The minimum total cost occurs when we buy 3 red baskets, which costs $48.

\]

Next, we know that it takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. To find out how long it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

\[

\]

Now, we need to convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[

3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which can be expressed as \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the sum of all your ages:
\[
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87

We know that:
- Julie sold 14 glasses.
- The total number of glasses sold by all three is 32 glasses.
- Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses.

Let the number of glasses sold by Micah (and also by Mitchell) be represented as \( x \). Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can express the total sales as:

\[
14 + x + x = 32
\]

This simplifies to:

14 + 2x = 32
\]

Next, we subtract 14 from both sides:

\[
2x = 32 - 14
\]
\[
2x = 18

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope**: 
   Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is willing to buy it for $2 per meter. Therefore, the total selling price is:
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the new rope**: 
   Sarah wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. We need to know how long the new rope is to calculate the total cost. However, since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length (20 meters) for simplicity. Thus, the total cost of the new rope is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Length of New Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 30 \, \text{dollars}

894,"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). 

According to the problem:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, which means she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Now, we need to calculate how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns. 

Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn, so from Joe, she earned:
\[
\text{Earnings from Joe} = 6
\]

From Kamala, since she mowed her lawn \( 3x \) times, we need to determine how much she earned from Kamala. However, we don't have the payment rate for Kamala, so we will denote her payment per mow as \( k \). Thus, her earnings from Kamala would be:
\[
\text{Earnings from Kamala} = 3x \cdot k
\]

From Alba, since she mowed her lawn \( 5x \) times, her earnings from Alba would be:
\[
\text{Earnings from Alba} = 5x \cdot k
\]

Now, we can express Tasha's total earnings from mowing lawns as:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6 + 3x \cdot k + 5x \cdot k = 6 + (3x + 5x) \cdot k = 6 + 8x \cdot k
\]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing} + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80
\]
Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. Then we have:
\[
6 + 8x \cdot k + L = 80
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
L = 80 - 6 - 8x \cdot k
\]
\[
L = 74 - 8x \cdot k
\]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( x \) and \( k \). However, we don't have enough information to find specific values for \( x \) and \( k \). 

Since we know that Tasha's total earnings from mowing lawns must be a non-negative number, we can analyze the situation. If \( k \) is the payment per mow, it must be a reasonable amount, and \( x \) must also be a non-negative integer.

To find a reasonable estimate, let's assume \( k = 1 \) (which is a simple assumption for the sake of calculation). Then:
\[
L = 74 - 8x
\]

If \( x = 0 \) (meaning she didn't mow Joe's lawn), then:
\[
L = 74
\]
If \( x = 1 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 1 = 66
\]
If \( x = 2 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 2 = 58
\]
If \( x = 3 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 3 = 50
\]
If \( x = 4 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 4 = 42
\]
If \( x = 5 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 5 = 34
\]
If \( x = 6 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 6 = 26
\]
If \( x = 7 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 7 = 18
\]
If \( x = 8 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 8 = 10
\]
If \( x = 9 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 9 = 2
\]
If \( x = 10 \):
\[
L = 74 - 8 \cdot 10 = -6 \quad (\text{not possible})
\]

Thus, \( x \) can take values from 0 to 9, and for each of these values, \( L \) is a non-negative integer.

Since we are looking for how much she made from lemonade sales, we can conclude that the maximum she could have made from lemonade sales, assuming \( k = 1 \) and \( x = 0 \), is $74.

Thus, the final result for how much Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

To calculate how many miles Anis rowed, we first find 1/5 of Dijana's distance:

1/5 of 50 miles = 50 miles / 5 = 10 miles.

Now, since Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, we add this to Dijana's distance:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + 1/5 of Dijana's distance
Anis's distance = 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.

Now we can calculate the total distance both of them rowed:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.

3. **Cost of the ice cream**: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. Thus, the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of ice cream} = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

4. **Total cost of all items**: Now we can sum up the costs of the cake, balloons, and ice cream:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cake} + \text{Cost of balloons} + \text{Cost of ice cream}

   To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{2} = 14

Kira bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[
3 + 5 + 6 = 14

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops**:
   Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. Thus, the total revenue from selling all the lollipops is:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}

Josh's daily consumption = 2 slices (Abby's consumption) × 2 = 4 slices.

Now, we can find the total amount of bread consumed by both Abby and Josh in one day:

Total daily consumption = Abby's consumption + Josh's consumption
Total daily consumption = 2 slices + 4 slices = 6 slices.

Next, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, so we divide the total number of slices by the total daily consumption:

Number of days the loaf will last = Total slices / Total daily consumption
Number of days the loaf will last = 24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the second equation into the first and third equations.

Substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
P + 2J = 90
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
P = 90 - 2J \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Now, substituting \( A = J + 10 \) into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have two equations for \( P \):
1. \( P = 90 - 2J \)
2. \( P = 2J + 10 \)

Setting these two expressions for \( P \) equal to each other:
\[
90 - 2J = 2J + 10
\]
Adding \( 2J \) to both sides gives:
\[
90 = 4J + 10
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
80 = 4J
\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[
J = 20

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( A \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Finally, we can find \( P \):
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

936,"To determine how much money Cameron would save by choosing to pay for additional hours instead of the 24-hour stay, we first need to calculate the total cost for both options.

1. **Cost of the 24-hour stay**: 
   The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

2. **Cost of the 12-hour stay plus additional hours**:
   Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. 
   - From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours.
   - From 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours.
   - Therefore, Cameron will stay for a total of 12 hours + 5 hours = 17 hours.

   The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. 
   For the additional 5 hours, he will pay 70 pesos for each hour:
   - Additional cost = 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

   So, the total cost for the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
   - Total cost = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculating the savings**:
   Now we can find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the additional hours option instead of the 24-hour stay:
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay + additional hours
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Thus, Cameron saves 250 pesos by opting for the additional hours instead of paying for the full 24-hour stay.

937,"To determine how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the amount of hay required for both the goats and the sheep.

1. **Calculate the amount of hay needed for the goats:**
   Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for the goats is:
   \[
   \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay needed for the sheep:**
   Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. First, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   Now, we subtract 3 pounds from this amount to find out how much hay each sheep needs:
   \[
   \text{Hay per sheep} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   Since there are 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for the sheep is:
   \[
   \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of hay needed:**
   Now, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep:
   \[
   \text{Total hay needed} = \text{Total hay for goats} + \text{Total hay for sheep} = 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we need to account for his expenses. He spends 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 50 \, \text{dollars (gas)} + 100 \, \text{dollars (deposit)} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much money John has left after his expenses:

\[
\text{Money Left} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Expenses} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 150 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:

\[
\text{Cost of Pencils} = 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars}

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty charges a flat fee of $40 for visiting the house.

2. **Labor Charge**: Patty charges $35 per hour for labor. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round this up to the nearest hour because the charge is for ""per hour, or part thereof."" Therefore, 2.25 hours rounds up to 3 hours.

   Labor charge = 3 hours × $35/hour = $105.

3. **Parts Charge**: The cost of parts used for the job is $60.

Now, we can sum all these charges to find the total cost:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205.

1. **Calculate the distance he swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the total distance of the lake, which is 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. The time taken to swim 12 miles is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   After swimming, James rests for half the time he spent swimming. Therefore, his resting time is:
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   After swimming 12 miles, the remaining distance to swim is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed. His original speed is 2 miles per hour, so half of that is:
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}

To find the actual number of attendees, we can denote the actual number of attendees as \( x \). According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
48 = x + 0.2x

- Let \( J \) be the number of balls Jordan carried.
- Let \( A \) be the number of balls Jason carried.
- Let \( B \) be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason:
   \[
   J = 2A
   \]

2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey:
   \[
   A = 2B
   \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls:
\[
A = 2

   - Day 2: 13 holes
   - Day 3: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on Day 3 is 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

2. **Total holes dug by the end of Day 3:**
   - Total holes = Day 1 + Day 2 + Net Day 3
   - Total holes = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

3. **Holes at the end of Day 1:**
   - At the end of Day 1, they had dug 10 holes.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

Substituting \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334
\]

Now, we can substitute \( S \) from the third equation into this equation. We have:
\[
D = \frac{334 - 2S}{1}
\]

Now substituting \( S = 4D - 13 \) into \( D = \frac{334 - 2S}{1} \):
\[
D = \frac{334 - 2(4D - 13)}{1}
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
D = 334 - 8D + 26
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
D + 8D = 360
\]
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing both sides by 9 gives:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152

Now we can verify:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second Segment (North)**:
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third Segment (South)**:
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled south and north:

- Total distance traveled south = Distance from the first segment + Distance from the third segment
  - Total south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

- Total distance traveled north = Distance from the second segment
  - Total north = 36 miles

Now, we can find the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes by subtracting the total distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

   1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed for the entire vacation**: 
   She will be outside for 8 days, so the total amount of sunscreen she will need for the entire vacation is:
   \[
   4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bottles of sunscreen are required**: 
   Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount in each bottle:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}

978,"To find the cost of both cars, we start with the price of the blue car, which is given as $100.

Next, we need to determine the price of the red car. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price reduction, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:

\[
40\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40
\]

Now, we subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the price of the red car:

\[
\text{Price of red car} = \text{Price of blue car} - \text{Price reduction} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Now we have the prices of both cars:
- Blue car: $100
- Red car: $60

Finally, we can state the total cost of both cars:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Price of blue car} + \text{Price of red car} = 100 + 60 = 160

In 5 years, when Emil turns 24, we can denote his dad's current age as \( D \) and his brother's current age as \( B \).

According to the problem, when Emil is 24:
- He will be half the age of his dad: 
  \[
  24 = \frac{D + 5}{2}
  \]
  This can be rearranged to find \( D \):
  \[
  48 = D + 5 \implies D = 48 - 5 = 43

2. **Sautéing the shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how long it takes to sauté 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}

Now, since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can determine that Bill's dad will see the comet again when he is \( D + 75 \) years old. 

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

When Bill's dad saw the comet, he was 30 years old. The age difference between Bill and his dad is \( D - B = 30 - B \).

When Bill's dad sees the comet again, he will be \( 30 + 75 = 105 \) years old. At that time, Bill's age will be \( B + 75 \).

According to the problem, at the time of the second sighting of the comet, Bill's age is three times the age of his father when he first saw the comet:

\[
B + 75 = 3 \times 30

Calculating the right side:

\[
B + 75 = 90

\]

The remaining flights, which are not to Greece, are:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x

   The bride decided to give half of the total cookies to the church. Thus, the number of cookies given to the church is:
   \[
   \text{Cookies to church} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cookies} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

3. **Calculate how many people were in the church:**
   Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:
   \[
   \text{Number of people in church} = \frac{\text{Cookies to church}}{\text{Cookies per person}} = \frac{750}{15} = 50

999,"To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the 2 adults and 4 kids, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:

\[
4x
\]

Each adult gets a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice, so each adult's slice is:

\[
2x
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:

\[
2 \times 2x = 4x
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total size of the slices for the adults and the kids:

\[
\text{Total size of watermelon} = \text{Total size for adults} + \text{Total size for kids} = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

Next, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult receives a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of watermelon}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100
\]

The \( x \) cancels out:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
\]

Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits.

First, we calculate the total number of selfies:

\[
\text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of portraits:

\[
\text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher is present (which happens with a 50% probability), there are two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension Given**: There is a 40% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension. If this happens, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension Given**: If the teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a 60% probability), there is a further chance that Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework. There is a 20% chance that he can convince her, meaning he would not have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

- **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher**:
  - Probability of no extension given: 60% (0.6)
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% (0.8)
  - Therefore, the probability of having to turn in homework when the normal teacher is present is:
    \[
    P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
    \]

- **Overall probability of having to turn in homework**:
  - Probability of having to turn in homework with the substitute teacher: 0% (0.5 * 0)
  - Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher: 50% (0.5) * 48% (0.48)
  
Combining these probabilities:
\[
P(\text{turn in homework}) = P(\text{substitute}) \times 0 + P(\text{normal}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | normal}) 
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0 + 0.24 = 0.24

3. **Seats reserved for faculty**: 300 seats

Next, we calculate the total number of seats that are reserved for graduates and faculty:

\[
\text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} = 950 + 300 = 1250

1. **Dimensions of the bed**:
   - Length: 6 feet
   - Width: 8 feet

2. **Dimensions of the fabric pieces**:
   - Jim needs each piece to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.
   - Therefore, the length of each fabric piece will be:
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - The width of each fabric piece will be:
     \[
     8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}

1. **Monday's Delivery**: 
   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery**: 
   On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. 
   First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
   \[
   \text{One-fifth of Monday's delivery} = \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Now, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's delivery} = 85 + 17 = 102

- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount divided among the three people as follows:

\[

   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**: 
   Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Assuming a full day is 8 hours, the hours worked each day is:

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of balls retrieved across all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30

1048,"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000.
2. **Depreciation Rate**: The car loses 21% of its value each year. This means that at the end of each year, the car retains 79% of its value (100% - 21% = 79%).

We can express the value of the car after each year using the formula:

\[
\text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n
\]

In this case, the depreciation rate is 0.21, so the retention rate is 0.79. We need to calculate the value after 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

3. **Calculation**:
   - For \( n = 3 \):
   \[
   \text{Value after 3 years} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Total daily food}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: 
   Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Becky's Slices**: 
   We know from the problem that Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices**: 
   According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. If we let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate, we can express this relationship as:
   \[
   B = J + 3
   \]
   Since we know Becky ate 10 slices:
   \[
   10 = J + 3
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]
   So, Jake ate 7 slices.

4. **Silvia's Slices**: 
   The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, we can express Silvia's slices \( S \) as:
   \[
   S = 2J
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( J \):
   \[
   S = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]
   So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

5. **Total Slices Eaten**: 
   Now we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
   \[
   \text{Total} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14
   \]
   Calculating this gives:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 31
   \]

6. **Final Result**: 
   The total number of slices they ate is 31.

Thus, the final result is:

1061,"Let \( d \) represent the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can express the time Betsy spent as \( d + 18 \).

The total time for the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
d + (d + 18) = 98
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
2d + 18 = 98
\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides:

\[
2d = 98 - 18
\]
\[
2d = 80
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Now that we have \( d \), which is the time Donovan spent, we can find the time Betsy spent:

\[
\text{Betsy's time} = d + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
\]

Thus, the time Betsy spent on her part of the meal is:

1. **Cost of the cast**: This is a fixed charge of $200.

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour. Since Hannah's visit lasts for 30 minutes, we need to convert that into hours. 
   - 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   300 \text{ (per hour)} \times 0.5 \text{ (hours)} = 150
   \]

3. **Cost of painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \text{ (per pill)} \times 30 \text{ (pills)} = 120
   \]

4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for parking, with a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the total cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \text{ (per hour)} \times 2 \text{ (hours)} = 12
   \]

Now, we can sum all these costs to find the total cost of the visit:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cast} + \text{Cost of visit} + \text{Cost of painkillers} + \text{Cost of parking}

1. **Cost of Butter Without Promotion**: 
   - The price of butter is $4.00 per pound.

2. **Promotion Details**: 
   - The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means if Dennis buys 1 pound of butter for $4.00, he can buy a second pound for half price, which is $2.00.

3. **Calculating the Cost for 6 Pounds**:
   - To buy 6 pounds of butter, we can break it down into pairs of pounds:
     - For the first pound, he pays $4.00.
     - For the second pound, he pays $2.00 (half off).
     - This pattern continues for the next pairs:
       - 3rd pound: $4.00
       - 4th pound: $2.00
       - 5th pound: $4.00
       - 6th pound: $2.00

4. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The total cost for 6 pounds can be calculated as follows:
     - (1st pound: $4.00 + 2nd pound: $2.00) + (3rd pound: $4.00 + 4th pound: $2.00) + (5th pound: $4.00 + 6th pound: $2.00)
     - This simplifies to: 
       - $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00 (for the first 2 pounds)
       - $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00 (for the next 2 pounds)
       - $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00 (for the last 2 pounds)
     - Therefore, the total cost is:
       - $6.00 + $6.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

1082,"James's home is 4 miles from the store, which means the total distance to the store is 4 miles. 

When he walks halfway to the store, he covers 2 miles (since half of 4 miles is 2 miles). After realizing he forgot something, he walks back home, covering another 2 miles. 

Now, let's calculate the time taken for each segment of his walk:

1. **Walking to the halfway point (2 miles)**:
   - Speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

2. **Walking back home (2 miles)**:
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

At this point, he has spent 0.5 hours walking to the halfway point and 0.5 hours walking back home, totaling:
0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

Now, he needs to walk the full distance to the store (4 miles). 

3. **Walking from home to the store (4 miles)**:
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

Finally, we add the time taken for all segments:
1 hour (to halfway and back) + 1 hour (to the store) = 2 hours.

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of buying these 40 bananas individually. The price per banana is $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[
\text{Cost of 40 bananas} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars/banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find out how much Jenny spent by buying the bananas in bunches. She bought 10 bunches at a cost of $3.00 per bunch:

\[
\text{Cost of 10 bunches} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost of 40 bananas} - \text{Cost of 10 bunches} = 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars}

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation, we have:

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes = 300 / 2 = 150
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes = 0.15 * 300 = 45
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - MTB bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now we know the number of each type of bike sold:
- MTB: 105
- BMX: 45
- Trekking: 150

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- **Earnings from MTB**: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
- **Earnings from BMX**: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- **Earnings from Trekking**: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500

Now, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

1. **Calculate Micah's distance**:
   - Amber ran 8 miles.
   - Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
   - Therefore, Micah's distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times \text{Amber's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}

2. **Calculate Ahito's distance**:
   - The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.
   - We can express this as:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance} + \text{Ahito's distance}
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual retirement needs:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement.
   - Current salary = $100,000
   - Annual retirement needs = 40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

2. **Calculate total retirement savings needed for 20 years:**
   - Total retirement savings needed = Annual retirement needs * Number of retirement years
   - Total retirement savings needed = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

4. **Calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years Lauren needs to work.
   - Total savings after \( x \) years = Annual savings * Number of years worked = $20,000 * \( x \).
   - We need this to equal $800,000:
     \[

1122,"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \( 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \).
   - Therefore, both workers together produce: \( 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \).

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - In 10 hours, one worker produces: \( 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \).
   - Therefore, both workers together produce: \( 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \).

3. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - Total toys produced by the first four workers: \( 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \).

4. **Determine how many toys are still needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys.
   - After the first four workers, the number of toys still needed is: \( 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \).

5. **Calculate the total production time available for the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker also works for 10 hours.

6. **Determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce:**
   - Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order, we can set up the equation for the fifth worker's production:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour.
   - In 10 hours, the fifth worker produces: \( 10x \) toys.
   - We know that \( 10x = 20 \) (since the fifth worker needs to produce 20 toys).

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Dividing both sides by 10 gives: \( x = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \).

Thus, the fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour.

2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, which means he used:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of stickers Luis had left after using half is:

- Arnold: \( x \)
- Madeline: \( x \)

Next, we know that Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( y \). Therefore, Camden painted \( y + 12 \) eggs (since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah).

The equation for Camden and Sarah's total is:

\[
y + (y + 12) = 30
\]

Simplifying this equation gives:

\[
2y + 12 = 30
\]

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

\[

Dividing by 2:

\[
y = 9

Now we have:

- Arnold: \( x \)
- Madeline: \( x \)
- Sarah: \( 9 \)

Let the number of men be \( 5x \) and the number of women be \( 9x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
5x + 9x = 84
\]

Combining the terms gives:

\[

   \]

2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
   \[
   P(B) = 3 \times P(A) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60

2. Jim's collection is 5 more than Carlos's collection. Therefore, we can express Carlos's collection as:
   \[
   \text{Carlos's collection} = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Thus, we can express Carlos's collection in terms of Carrey's collection:
   \[
   \text{Carlos's collection} = 2C
   \]
   Setting this equal to the previously calculated amount for Carlos:
   \[
   2C = 22

Now we have:
- Carrey collected \( C = 11 \) seashells.
- Carlos collected \( 22 \) seashells.
- Jim collected \( 27 \) seashells.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:

1. **Cost of Devices:**
   - Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.
   - The cost of one device is $20.
   - Total cost for 2 devices = 2 devices × $20/device = $40.
   - Total cost for 4 devices = 4 devices × $20/device = $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for all devices = $40 + $80 = $120.

1. **Total eggs hidden**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Lamar's finds**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Stacy's finds**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Stacy's finds} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Charlie's finds**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. Thus:
   \[
   \text{Charlie's finds} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Mei's finds**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Mei's finds} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs found by adding the eggs found by each person:
\[
\text{Total eggs found} = \text{Lamar's finds} + \text{Stacy's finds} + \text{Charlie's finds} + \text{Mei's finds}

Finally, we find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard by subtracting the total eggs found from the total eggs hidden:
\[
\text{Eggs still hidden} = \text{Total eggs hidden} - \text{Total eggs found}
\]
\[
\text{Eggs still hidden} = 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}

4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to first find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits).
   \[
   \text{Fruits at 10 years} = 20 \times 50 = 1000

The blue rope is also stated to be 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Therefore, we can express the length of the yellow rope as \( y = b + 7 \).

Now, we know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. We can set up the following equation:

\[
r + b + y = 37
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( y \) into the equation gives us:

\[
4b + b + (b + 7) = 37

Simplifying this equation:

\[
4b + b + b + 7 = 37
\]
\[

Next, we subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
6b = 30

According to the problem, half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:

\[
\text{Yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total amount of paint used in the mural:

\[
6 = 3x

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy for $27,000, we first calculate how many sets of 100 books he can purchase:

1. Calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54
   \]

2. Since each set contains 100 books, we can find the total number of books:
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400
   \]

Now, Bob is distributing these 5400 books among 3 schools. To find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:

3. Calculate the number of books per school:
   \[
   \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
   \]

Thus, Bob can buy 1800 books for each school.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up both apples.
   - Apples with Newton: 2

2. He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples in pocket: 1
   - Apples thrown: 1 (into the tree)

3. The apple thrown into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Total apples now: 1 (in pocket) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6

4. Newton picked up these 5 apples (the ones that fell out of the tree) and put all but one in his pocket.
   - He keeps 1 apple out of the 5, so:
   - Apples in pocket: 1 (from before) + 4 (from the 5 he picked up) = 5
   - Apples kept out: 1

5. He threw the remaining apple (the one he kept out) at the tree, which caused another 6 apples to fall out.
   - Total apples now: 5 (in pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 11

6. Finally, Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (the 6 that fell out) and went home.
   - Apples in pocket: 11

Thus, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 11.

1184,"To find the total cost of Ali's order for coal, we first need to determine how many bags of coal he ordered. Since the coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, we can calculate the number of bags by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag.

1. Calculate the number of bags:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per bag}} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total cost of the coal. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}

Kate has 6 friends, and each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Calculating the total slices of cheese pizza consumed:
\[
\text{Total cheese slices} = 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices}
\]

Calculating the total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed:
\[
\text{Total pepperoni slices} = 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[
\text{Cheese pizzas needed} = \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}

1187,"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour. This means he builds:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

2. **Melting Rate**: Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. This translates to:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ snowballs}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

3. **Net Rate**: To find the net rate of snowballs Jay has after accounting for melting, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. We convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to have a denominator of 15:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}
   \]
   Now we can subtract:
   \[
   \text{Net rate} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}
   \]

4. **Time to Build 60 Snowballs**: We need to find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs at the net rate of \(\frac{1}{5}\) snowballs per minute. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{\frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes}

1188,"To find Jim's age, we start by determining how old John was when Digimon was released. Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it was released 20 years ago. 

Given that John is currently 28 years old, we can calculate his age at the time of the release:

\[
\text{John's age when Digimon was released} = 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old}
\]

According to the problem, at the time of the release, John was twice as old as Jim. We can set up the equation:

\[
\text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age}
\]

Substituting John's age at that time:

\[
8 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age}
\]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
\text{Jim's age} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
\]

Now we have determined that Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. To find Jim's current age, we add the 20 years since the release:

\[
\text{Jim's current age} = 4 + 20 = 24 \text{ years old}

**Day 2:**
- Bandages used: 10 fewer than Day 1, which is \( 38 - 10 = 28 \)
- Bandages left after Day 2:

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}

   Mattison is 60 inches tall.

2. **Height of the Two-Story House**: 
   The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height:
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Height of the First Floor**: 
   The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height:
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}

Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at a price that is \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. 

To calculate the selling price, we multiply the purchase price by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Purchase Price} \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
   \[
   V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = (6 \times 6) \times 15 = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}

5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
\]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:

\[
c + b = 10
\]

Substituting the expression for \( b \) into the equation gives:

\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Next, add 2 to both sides:

\[
4c = 12
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:

\[
c = 3
\]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes. 

To verify, we can calculate the number of brownies:

\[
b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
\]

Now, check the total number of treats:

\[
c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
\]

This matches the requirement of 10 treats for the class.

The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Since half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distances as follows:

- Distance on land = \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water = \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each segment:

1. **Time spent hopping on land:**
   - Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
   - Distance on land = 100 yards
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Time spent swimming in water:**

We know that the cost of the main phone is $20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

1270,"To find the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the value at the end of each year step by step.

1. **Initial Value**: The boat was bought for $9000.

2. **First Year Depreciation**: The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * 9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Initial value - Depreciation amount = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**: The boat depreciated by another 30% in the second year, but this time it is based on the value at the end of the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * 6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value after first year - Depreciation amount = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**: The boat depreciated by 20% in the third year, again based on the value at the end of the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * 4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value after second year - Depreciation amount = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

After calculating the depreciation for each year, the final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

1. **Red candies**: We know there are 54 red candies.

2. **Orange candies**: The problem states that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. Therefore, the number of orange candies is:
   \[
   \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times \text{Red candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]

3. **Yellow candies**: The problem states that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. Therefore, the number of yellow candies is:
   \[
   \text{Yellow candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Red candies} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of candies accounted for so far:
\[
\text{Total candies accounted} = \text{Red candies} + \text{Orange candies} + \text{Yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

1. Weight of the car: 1200 pounds
2. Weight of the luggage: 250 pounds
3. Weight of the two children: 75 pounds each, so \( 75 \times 2 = 150 \) pounds

Now, we can calculate the total weight:

1. **Calculating the cost of the T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts.
   - The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means:
     - The first T-shirt costs $8.
     - The second T-shirt costs 50% off the original price of $8, which is:
       \[
       50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.5 \times 8 = 4
       \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
     \[
     8 + 4 = 12
     \]

2. **Calculating the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so we calculate the discount:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.4 \times 40 = 16
     \]
   - The sale price of the shoes after the discount is:
     \[
     40 - 16 = 24
     \]

3. **Calculating the total amount spent:**
   - Now we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:
     \[
     12 + 24 = 36
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

1295,"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over the 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

\[
\text{Total allowance} = \text{Weekly allowance} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

So, Ryan earned $18 from his chores.

Next, we need to determine how much he spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, which means he bought a total of 4 ice cream cones. The cost of each ice cream cone is $1.25, so we calculate the total cost of the ice cream as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = \text{Number of cones} \times \text{Cost per cone} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5
\]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[
\text{Money left after ice cream} = \text{Total allowance} - \text{Total cost of ice cream} = 18 - 5 = 13
\]

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. The cost of each movie ticket is $6.50. We can calculate the number of tickets he can buy by dividing the money he has left by the cost of one ticket:

\[
\text{Number of tickets} = \frac{\text{Money left}}{\text{Cost per ticket}} = \frac{13}{6.50}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{13}{6.50} = 2
\]

Since Ryan can only buy whole tickets, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

3. **Bracelet**: $8.50

Now, we can add these amounts together to find the total spending:

\[
\text{Total Spending} = \text{Ice Cream} + \text{Movie Tickets} + \text{Bracelet}
\]
\[
\text{Total Spending} = 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
\[

Next, we know that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. If we let the distance that Aaron runs be \( d_A \), then the distance that Vanessa runs is:

From the problem, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Thus, we have:

Now, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race (2 miles) in 16 minutes. We can find Aaron's speed:
\[
v_A = \frac{d_A}{\text{time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}

1313,"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to determine the total selling price after the profit is applied.

1. **Calculate the cost price of one watermelon**:
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. Therefore, the cost price (CP) of one watermelon is:
   \[
   \text{CP per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the selling price with a profit of 25%**:
   A profit of 25% means that the selling price (SP) is 125% of the cost price. We can calculate the selling price per watermelon as follows:
   \[
   \text{SP per watermelon} = \text{CP per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage})
   \]
   Here, the profit percentage is 25%, which can be expressed as 0.25 in decimal form. Thus:
   \[
   \text{SP per watermelon} = 1.6 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.6 \times 1.25 = 2.0 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Final Result**:
   Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

1314,"Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **James's Age**: We know that James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora. We also know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

2. **Calculating James's Age**: Since James is twice as old as Dora, we can calculate James's current age:
   \[
   \text{James's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **John's Age**: John had James when he was 19. Therefore, we can calculate John's current age:
   \[
   \text{John's age} = 19 + \text{James's age} = 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **John's Youngest Son**: John had his youngest son when he was 32. To find out how old John's youngest son is now, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{John's youngest son's age} = \text{John's age} - 32 = 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
   \]

5. **Calculating the Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years**: Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years:
   \[
   \text{Youngest son's age in 3 years} = \text{Current age} + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

1315,"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we first need to calculate how many oranges each of them can peel in that time.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Oranges peeled by Ana} - \text{Oranges peeled by Jane} = 20 - 15 = 5
     \]

Thus, after one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

1316,"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the cost of hiring the mechanic.

1. **Cost of the new radiator:**
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80% off
   - Amount of discount: 80% of $400 = 0.80 * 400 = $320
   - Cost after discount: $400 - $320 = $80

2. **Cost of hiring the mechanic:**
   - Hourly rate: $50
   - Time taken: 3 hours
   - Total cost for the mechanic: 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of mechanic
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Thus, the total amount Mark paid is $230.

1317,"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( W \).

We know two things from the problem:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + W = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 70
   \]

Now we can simplify the second equation. We can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
C + 2W = 35
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( C + W = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2W = 35 \)

Next, we can solve this system. We can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
W = 15
\]

Now that we have the number of cows, we can substitute \( W \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
Subtracting 15 from both sides gives:
\[
C = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is 5.

1318,"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the pizzas.

Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, and there are 7 pizzas. Therefore, the total number of slices is:

\[
7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry has 3 friends, which means there are a total of:

\[
1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ (friends)} = 4 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:

\[
\frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person}
\]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices.
