• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood.
• Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter changes, leading to complex phase-space structures.
• The behavior of individual trajectories in chaotic systems can differ significantly from ensemble behavior.
• Current reversals in chaotic systems may not always be correlated with bifurcations from chaotic to periodic behavior.
• The behavior of the current in chaotic ratchets depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble and the presence of transients.
• Bifurcations in single-trajectory behavior often correspond to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system.
• Not all spikes or jumps in the current correspond to bifurcations, and vice versa.
• Understanding the behavior of chaotic ratchets requires considering specific systems in detail before generalizing.
