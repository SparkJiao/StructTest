4. **Check Each Number**:
   - For each number `num`, check if it is already in the `amicables` set. If it is, skip to the next number.

5. **Calculate Sum of Divisors**:
   - Calculate `sum_fact`, the sum of proper divisors of `num`.
   - Calculate `sum_fact2`, the sum of proper divisors of `sum_fact`.

6. **Check Amicable Condition**:
   - Check if `num` is equal to `sum_fact2` and `num` is not equal to `sum_fact`.
   - If both conditions are true, add `num` and `sum_fact` to the `amicables` set.

7. **Sum of Amicable Numbers**:
   - After iterating through all numbers, calculate the sum of all numbers in the `amicables` set.

6. Since no match is found, `re.search` returns `None`.

1. The function `text_lowercase_underscore` takes a string `text` as input.
2. The function defines a regex pattern `patterns = '^[a-z]+_[a-z]+$'`.
   - This pattern matches strings that start with one or more lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`), followed by an underscore (`_`), and end with one or more lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`).
3. The function uses `re.search(patterns, text)` to check if the input `text` matches the pattern.
4. If the input `text` matches the pattern, the function returns `True`.
5. If the input `text` does not match the pattern, the function returns `False`.

Now, let's apply this to the input `""Aaab_abbbc""`:

- The input string `""Aaab_abbbc""` starts with an uppercase letter 'A', which does not match the pattern `[a-z]+` for lowercase letters.

3. **Calculate L[i][j] for substrings of length 2 to n:**

   - **cl = 2:**
     - For each pair `(i, j)` where `j = i + 1`, check if `str[i] == str[j]`.
     - If they are equal, set `L[i][j] = 2`, otherwise set `L[i][j] = 1`.

Let's go through the iterations:

- **cl = 2:**
  - Compare pairs of adjacent characters. None of them are equal, so `L[i][j]` remains 1 for all pairs.

- **cl = 3:**
  - Compare triplets. None of them form a palindrome longer than 1, so `L[i][j]` remains 1 or 2.

- **cl = 4 to 13:**

   - **For `cl = 3`:**
     - For `i = 0`, `j = 2`: `str[0] = 'C'`, `str[2] = 'R'`, not equal, so `L[0][2] = max(L[0][1], L[1][2]) = 1`.

6. Iterate over the range from 3 to `n + 1` (i.e., 3 to 5):
   - For `i = 3`:
     - Calculate `dp[3]` using the formula `((k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])) % mod`.
     - Substitute the values: `dp[3] = ((4 - 1) * (dp[2] + dp[1])) % 1000000007`.
     - Calculate: `dp[3] = (3 * (16 + 4)) % 1000000007`.
     - Calculate: `dp[3] = (3 * 20) % 1000000007`.
     - Calculate: `dp[3] = 60 % 1000000007`.
     - So, `dp[3] = 60`. Now, `dp = [0, 4, 16, 60, 0]`.
   - For `i = 4`:
     - Calculate `dp[4]` using the formula `((k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])) % mod`.
     - Substitute the values: `dp[4] = ((4 - 1) * (dp[3] + dp[2])) % 1000000007`.
     - Calculate: `dp[4] = (3 * (60 + 16)) % 1000000007`.
     - Calculate: `dp[4] = (3 * 76) % 1000000007`.
     - Calculate: `dp[4] = 228 % 1000000007`.
     - So, `dp[4] = 228`. Now, `dp = [0, 4, 16, 60, 228]`.

     - `j = 4`: `a[4] = 100`, `a[4]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][4] = a[4] + a[0] = 100 + 1 = 101`.
     - `j = 5`: `a[5] = 4`, `a[5]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][5] = a[5] + a[0] = 4 + 1 = 5`.
     - `j = 6`: `a[6] = 5`, `a[6]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][6] = a[6] + a[0] = 5 + 1 = 6`.
   - Updated `dp` table:
     ```
     dp = [[1, 102, 3, 4, 101, 5, 6], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```

3. **Fill the rest of the DP table:**
   - For `i = 1`, iterate over `j` from 0 to 6:
     - `j = 0`: `a[0] = 1`, `a[0]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][0] = dp[0][0] = 1`.
     - `j = 1`: `a[1] = 101`, `a[1]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] = 102`.
     - `j = 2`: `a[2] = 2`, `a[2]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] = 3`.
     - `j = 3`: `a[3] = 3`, `a[3]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][3] = dp[0][3] = 4`.
     - `j = 4`: `a[4] = 100`, `a[4]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][4] = dp[0][4] = 101`.
     - `j = 5`: `a[5] = 4`, `a[5]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][5] = dp[0][5] = 5`.
     - `j = 6`: `a[6] = 5`, `a[6]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][6] = dp[0][6] = 6`.

           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

     - `j = 1`: `a[1] = 101`, `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][1] = max(dp[1][2] + a[1], dp[1][1]) = max(3 + 101, 102) = 104`.
     - `j = 2`: `a[2] = 2`, `a[2]` is not greater than `a[2]`, so `dp[2][2] = dp[1][2] = 3`.
     - `j = 3`: `a[3] = 3`, `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][3] = max(dp[1][2] + a[3], dp[1][3]) = max(3 + 3, 4) = 6`.
     - `j = 4`: `a[4] = 100`, `a[4]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][4] = max(dp[1][2] + a[4], dp[1][4]) = max(3 + 100, 101) = 103`.
     - `j = 5`: `a[5] = 4`, `a[5]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][5] = max(dp[1][2] + a[5], dp[1][5]) = max(3 + 4, 5) = 7`.
     - `j = 6`: `a[6] = 5`, `a[6]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][6] = max(dp[1][2] + a[6], dp[1][6]) = max(3 + 5, 6) = 8`.
   - Updated `dp` table:
     ```
     dp = [[1, 102, 3, 4, 101, 5, 6], 
           [1, 102, 3, 4, 101, 5, 6], 
           [1, 104, 3, 6, 103, 7, 8],

   - For `i = 5`, iterate over `j` from 0 to 6:
     - `j = 0`: `a[0] = 1`, `a[0]` is not greater than `a[5]`, so `dp[5][0] = dp[4][0] = 1`.
     - `j = 1`: `a[1] = 101`, `a[1]` is greater than `a[5]` and `j > i`, so `dp[5][1] = max(dp[4][5] + a[1], dp[4][1]) = max(10 + 101, 107) = 111`.

     - `j = 1`: `a[1] = 101`, `a[1]` is greater than `a[6]` and `j > i`, so `",0,{}
306_2,"Let's simulate the execution of the function step by step.

1. **Initialization**:
   - We have the input list `a = [11, 15, 19, 21, 26, 28, 31]` and `n = 7`.
   - We need to create a 2D list `dp` of size `n x n` initialized with zeros. So initially, `dp` looks like this:
     ```
     dp = [
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```

2. **First Loop (`i = 0`)**:
   - We iterate over `j` from `0` to `n-1` (i.e., `0` to `6`).
   - For `j = 0`: `a[0]` is not greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][0] = a[0] = 11`.
   - For `j = 1`: `a[1]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][1] = a[1] + a[0] = 15 + 11 = 26`.
   - For `j = 2`: `a[2]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][2] = a[2] + a[0] = 19 + 11 = 30`.
   - For `j = 3`: `a[3]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][3] = a[3] + a[0] = 21 + 11 = 32`.
   - For `j = 4`: `a[4]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][4] = a[4] + a[0] = 26 + 11 = 37`.
   - For `j = 5`: `a[5]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][5] = a[5] + a[0] = 28 + 11 = 39`.
   - For `j = 6`: `a[6]` is greater than `a[0]`, so `dp[0][6] = a[6] + a[0] = 31 + 11 = 42`.
   - After this loop, `dp` looks like:
     ```
     dp = [
       [11, 26, 30, 32, 37, 39, 42],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ]
     ```

3. **Second Loop (`i = 1`)**:
   - We iterate over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For `j = 0`: `a[0]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][0] = dp[0][0] = 11`.
   - For `j = 1`: `a[1]` is not greater than `a[1]`, so `dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] = 26`.
   - For `j = 2`: `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]` and `j > i`, so `dp[1][2] = max(dp[0][1] + a[2], dp[0][2]) = max(26 + 19, 30) = 45`.
   - For `j = 3`: `a[3]` is greater than `a[1]` and `j > i`, so `dp[1][3] = max(dp[0][1] + a[3], dp[0][3]) = max(26 + 21, 32) = 47`.
   - For `j = 4`: `a[4]` is greater than `a[1]` and `j > i`, so `dp[1][4] = max(dp[0][1] + a[4], dp[0][4]) = max(26 + 26, 37) = 52`.
   - For `j = 5`: `a[5]` is greater than `a[1]` and `j > i`, so `dp[1][5] = max(dp[0][1] + a[5], dp[0][5]) = max(26 + 28, 39) = 54`.
   - For `j = 6`: `a[6]` is greater than `a[1]` and `j > i`, so `dp[1][6] = max(dp[0][1] + a[6], dp[0][6]) = max(26 + 31, 42) = 57`.
   - After this loop, `dp` looks like:
     ```
     dp = [
       [11, 26, 30, 32, 37, 39, 42],
       [11, 26, 45, 47, 52, 54, 57],

4. **Third Loop (`i = 2`)**:
   - We iterate over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

   - For `j = 2`: `a[2]` is not greater than `a[2]`, so `dp[2][2] = dp[1][2] = 45`.
   - For `j = 3`: `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][3] = max(dp[1][2] + a[3], dp[1][3]) = max(45 + 21, 47) = 66`.
   - For `j = 4`: `a[4]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][4] = max(dp[1][2] + a[4], dp[1][4]) = max(45 + 26, 52) = 71`.
   - For `j = 5`: `a[5]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][5] = max(dp[1][2] + a[5], dp[1][5]) = max(45 + 28, 54) = 73`.
   - For `j = 6`: `a[6]` is greater than `a[2]` and `j > i`, so `dp[2][6] = max(dp[1][2] + a[6], dp[1][6]) = max(45 + 31, 57) = 76`.
   - After this loop, `dp` looks like:
     ```
     dp = [
       [11, 26, 30, 32, 37, 39, 42],
       [11, 26, 45, 47, 52, 54, 57],

     ]
     ```

5. **Fourth Loop (`i = 3`)**:
   - We iterate over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For `j = 0`: `a[0]` is not greater than `a[3]`, so `dp[3][0] = dp[2][0] = 11`.

   - For `j = 5`: `a[5]` is greater than `a[3]` and `j > i`, so `dp[3][5] = max(dp[2][3] + a[5], dp[2][5]) = max(66 + 28, 73) = 94`.
   - For `j = 6`: `a[6]` is greater than `a[3]` and `j > i`, so `dp[3][6] = max(dp[2][3] + a[6], dp[2][6]) = max(66 + 31, 76) = 97`.

3. Initialize `pos` to `0`, `temp` to `n` (which is `12`), and `count` to `0`.
4. Enter the while loop since `temp` is not `0`.
   - First iteration:
     - `temp` is `12`, which in binary is `1100`.
     - Check if `temp & 1` is `0`. The last bit of `1100` is `0`, so the condition is true.
     - Set `pos` to `count`, which is `0`.
     - Increment `count` to `1`.
     - Right shift `temp` by `1`. Now, `temp` is `6`, which in binary is `110`.
   - Second iteration:
     - `temp` is `6`, which in binary is `110`.
     - Check if `temp & 1` is `0`. The last bit of `110` is `0`, so the condition is true.
     - Set `pos` to `count`, which is `1`.
     - Increment `count` to `2`.
     - Right shift `temp` by `1`. Now, `temp` is `3`, which in binary is `11`.
   - Third iteration:
     - `temp` is `3`, which in binary is `11`.
     - Check if `temp & 1` is `0`. The last bit of `11` is `1`, so the condition is false.
     - Increment `count` to `3`.
     - Right shift `temp` by `1`. Now, `temp` is `1`, which in binary is `1`.
   - Fourth iteration:
     - `temp` is `1`, which in binary is `1`.
     - Check if `temp & 1` is `0`. The last bit of `1` is `1`, so the condition is false.
     - Increment `count` to `4`.
     - Right shift `temp` by `1`. Now, `temp` is `0`.
5. Exit the while loop since `temp` is `0`.
6. Return `n | (1 << pos)`. Here, `pos` is `1`, so `1 << pos` is `2`, which in binary is `10`.
7. The bitwise OR of `n` (which is `12`, binary `1100`) and `2` (binary `10`) is `1110`, which is `14` in decimal.

1. The function `add_string` takes two arguments: `list_` and `string`.
2. The input `list_` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the input `string` is `'temp{0}'`.
3. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list `add_string` by iterating over each element `i` in `list_`.
4. For each element `i` in `list_`, the `string.format(i)` method is called, which replaces `{0}` in the string with the value of `i`.
5. Let's go through each element in `list_`:
   - For `i = 1`, `string.format(i)` results in `'temp1'`.
   - For `i = 2`, `string.format(i)` results in `'temp2'`.
   - For `i = 3`, `string.format(i)` results in `'temp3'`.
   - For `i = 4`, `string.format(i)` results in `'temp4'`.
6. The list comprehension collects these formatted strings into a new list: `['temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', 'temp4']`.

   - `^([a-z]).*\1$` checks if the string starts with a lowercase letter and contains the same letter again somewhere in the string.
3. The input string is `""abcd""`.
4. The function uses `re.search` to check if the input string matches the regular expression.
5. For the input `""abcd""`, let's evaluate the regular expression:
   - The string `""abcd""` is not a single lowercase letter, so it doesn't match `^[a-z]$`.
   - The string `""abcd""` starts with the letter 'a', but 'a' does not appear again in the string, so it doesn't match `^([a-z]).*\1$`.
6. Since the string `""abcd""` does not match either part of the regular expression, `re.search` returns `None`.
7. As a result, the function returns `""Invalid""`.

1. The function `combinations_list` is a recursive function that generates all possible combinations (subsets) of the input list.
2. The base case of the recursion is when the input list is empty (`len(list1) == 0`), in which case it returns a list containing an empty list: `[[]]`.
3. For a non-empty list, the function iterates over the combinations of the rest of the list (`list1[1:]`).
4. For each combination `el` of the rest of the list, it adds two combinations to the result: `el` itself and `el` with the first element of the list (`list1[0]`) appended to it.

2. Iterate over each element in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
   - For the first element, `num = 1`:
