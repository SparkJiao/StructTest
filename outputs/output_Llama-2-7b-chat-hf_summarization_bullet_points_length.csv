• The transport properties of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems are not well understood.
• Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions, and the behavior of a single trajectory can be very different from that of many trajectories.
• The current for an ensemble of particles in a chaotic system is defined as the time-average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions.
• The current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble, and a single trajectory may show current reversals that do not exist in the large ensemble data.
• A single trajectory is sufficient for a regular motion, but the convergence in the chaotic case is only obtained if the number of trajectories exceeds a certain threshold.
• The current versus @xmath0 curve for different sets of trajectories converges towards the dashed line as @xmath44 increases.
• Single-trajectory current values are typically significantly greater than ensemble averages.
• The results of barbi and salerno are disagreed with regarding the connection between bifurcation diagram and current reversals.",1

• The study examines the eccentricity of exoplanets in multiple-planet systems.
• The authors analyze the observations of 192 planetary systems, of which 23 are multi-planet systems.
• The study aims to combine observational limits on additional planets in known planetary systems with dynamical constraints obtained by n-body simulations.
• The authors performed test particle simulations to determine the regions in which additional low-mass planets could remain in stable orbits.
• The simulations were set up using the known planet's initial circular orbit, and test particles were placed in initially circular orbits spaced every 0.002 au in the region between 0.05-2.0 au.
• The study finds that nearly all of the test-particle removals occurred within the first @xmath9 yr, and the simulations had essentially stabilized to their final configurations after this time.
• The authors present updated keplerian orbital solutions for four of the planets, and detect a trend in the residuals of one system that could be due to a binary companion.
• The study suggests that very eccentric single-planet systems originate by interactions within a wide binary system, and that the shortest period that a distant outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the observed acceleration and uncertainty over the timespan of the observations is about 40 yr.
• The authors combine the results of their simulations with the known parameters of the planets in each system to place constraints on the architecture of planetary systems.

* The paper discusses the phenomenological implications of the no-scale structure of the Kähler potential in supersymmetric models.
* The no-scale scenario is characterized by a non-vanishing gaugino mass at the unification scale, which leads to a predictive and highly constrained framework.
* The paper reviews the current bounds on the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) from direct searches, flavor physics, and the Higgs boson mass, and shows how these constraints can be used to exclude large regions of the MSSM parameter space.

* The paper focuses on the case where the gaugino masses are universal at the unification scale, but the other parameters are not.
* The authors show that the minimal scenario is severely constrained by the combination of the Higgs boson mass bound, the LEP2 bound on the chargino mass, and the cosmological constraint on the lightest neutralino mass.
* The paper also considers the case where the gaugino masses are non-universal at the unification scale, which can lead to a more relaxed constraint on the MSSM parameter space.
* The authors show that the higgsino-like neutralino can be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in this scenario, which is consistent with the current experimental bounds.
* The paper includes a discussion on the possibility of observing the LSP at the Tevatron Run II, and concludes that the no-scale scenario is highly predictive and can be tested at future colliders.

* The authors consider a cross-polarized version of the Bartnik-Sachs (BS) spacetime and show that the resulting singularity structure is unchanged from the BS spacetime.
* The authors then investigate the stability of quasiregular singularities in the cross-polarized spacetime using a test scalar field.

* The paper discusses the non-local properties of quantum states, specifically the concepts of Bell non-locality, EPR steerability, and separability.
* Bell non-locality refers to the violation of local causality, where the outcome of a measurement on one system depends on the state of another system, even if they are separated by large distances.
* EPR steerability is a stronger notion of non-locality, where the state of one system can be demonstrated to be non-local through a local measurement on the other system.
* Separability refers to the ability to describe the correlations between two systems using a product of local states.
* The paper introduces the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism, which provides a deterministic local hidden variable (LHV) model for projective measurements on a two-qubit state.
* The steering ellipsoid is a surface in Bloch space that represents the set of all possible steered states, and its center and semiaxes are related to the eigenvalues of the spin correlation matrix.
* The paper gives a strong necessary condition for the EPR steerability of a large class of two-qubit states, which is conjectured to be also sufficient.
* The condition is obtained via the construction of a suitable LHV model, which is motivated by properties of the quantum steering ellipsoid.

• The idea of using spintronics to create a universal logic gate was first proposed in 1985 by Feynman.
• The source document discusses the potential advantages of using spin-based devices, such as lower power dissipation and faster switching times.

• The spin of an electron can be manipulated by applying a magnetic field, which can be used to encode information in the spin.
• In a three-spin system, the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of the spins can be used to create a classical universal logic gate.
• The ground state of the array is determined by the exchange interaction between the spins, and the upspin state is preferred over the downspin state.
• The truth table of the proposed logic gate is shown in Table 1.
• The problem with using this approach is that the exchange interaction is bidirectional, which can prevent the unidirectional flow of logic signal from input to output.
• One proposed solution to this problem is to use a three-phase clock to propagate the input state through the array.
• The clock pulse trains for a three-phase clock are shown in Figure 2(f).
• By lowering two adjacent barriers pairwise at the same time, we can propagate the input state through a linear array.
• A three-phase clock is required to ensure unidirectional flow of logic signal.

* The text discusses the injection of isotopic heterogeneity in protoplanetary disks through various mechanisms, including supernova shock waves, photodissociation of CO molecules, and magnetorotational instability (MRI).
* The author presents several new models of marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disks that explore the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula through a single-shot event or a continuous injection process.
* The models examine the effect of different disk and central protostar masses on the mixing and transport of isotopes in the disks.
* The author suggests that the MGU disks may be capable of achieving the high mass accretion rates needed to explain fuel-rich outbursts observed in low-mass protostars.
* The text also discusses the implications of the observed isotopic heterogeneity in comet 81p/Wild 2, which suggests that small particles experienced large-scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet-forming regions of the outer solar nebula.
* The author concludes that the MGU disks offer a means to accomplish this early large-scale transport, and that the observed isotopic heterogeneity in comets may be related to the MGU disk phase.
* The text highlights the importance of understanding the mixing and transport processes in M dwarf disks, as low-mass exoplanets are beginning to be discovered around increasingly larger fractions of M dwarfs.
* The author notes that the numerical models used in the study are based on the same three-dimensional, gravitational hydrodynamics code that has been employed in previous MGU disk models, and that the time evolution of the color field is calculated to follow the mixing and transport of isotopes carried by the disk gas or small particles.

* The paper aims to solve the Anderson impurity model in the general multiorbital case using the rational interpolative formula, and to reproduce the frequency dependence of the self-energy obtained from quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

1. The paper proposes a new method for computing the self-energy in strongly correlated electronic systems, which is based on a rational interpolative formula.
2. The formula is derived by assuming that only a well-defined set of poles in the rational representation is necessary to reproduce the overall frequency dependence of the self-energy.
3. The method is applied to the Anderson impurity model in the general multiorbital case, and the self-energy is computed using a combination of the rational interpolative formula and the slave-boson mean-field approximation.

4. The paper compares the results of the new method with those obtained using the quantum Monte Carlo method, and finds good agreement between the two.
5. The method is found to be computationally efficient and numerically stable, and is able to reproduce the quasiparticle peak and the renormalization of the quasiparticle residue in the spectrum of one-electron excitations.
6. The paper also discusses the extension of the method to include the effects of multiple doping and the renormalization of the interaction, and finds that these effects can be included by modifying the rational interpolative formula.

* The paper studies the distribution function of the transverse displacement of a wormlike chain with a fixed orientation of one end.
* The distribution function is computed using the exact representation of the distribution function in terms of the matrix element of the Green's function of the quantum rigid rotator in a homogeneous external field.

* The exact solution of the Green's function makes it possible to compute the quantities such as the structure factor, the end-to-end distribution function, etc.

* The paper presents practically exact calculations of the transverse distribution function of the 3D wormlike chain for intermediate chain lengths.

* The results show that the distribution function possesses a bimodal shape at intermediate chain lengths within the interval.

* The distribution function becomes gaussian for very short and very long chains.

* At the onset of bimodality, there is a tiny maximum at @xmath87, which is interpreted as a remnant of the gaussian behavior of short chains.

* The larger curvatures in the vicinity of the fixed end result in larger displacements @xmath88 of the free end, and therefore contribute preferentially to the maximum at @xmath89.

* The cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at Earth from outside and discovered in the early 20th century.
* The cosmic ray spectrum has been observed as a continuous spectrum at all energies, and high-energy particles have always been the source of the most important discoveries in particle physics.
* The observed cosmic rays have a quite featureless power-law energy spectrum that decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy, and the high-energy tail of the spectrum requires techniques that take advantage of the extensive air showers that the arriving particles develop as they pass through the atmosphere.
* The composition of the cosmic rays is a crucial issue in understanding the origins of the highest-energy particles, and many alternatives have been proposed to explain the observed features of the cosmic rays, including annihilation of topological defects created in the early universe, heavy relics that survive from the primeval bath, non-thermal particles that couple to gravity, or wimpzillas and annihilation of relic neutrinos with messenger neutrinos coming from remote places.

• The RHEED pattern of a 135 MnGe film observed along the $h$ direction of the Si substrate indicates two-dimensional film growth, and the uniformity of the intensity of the detected streaks implies a flat surface of a size comparable to the area contributing to the RHEED pattern of around 100 nm in diameter.

• The security proof also simulates the key generation rate with realistic parameters, including a simple model for the basis-dependent flaw.

* The methanol masers are found closest to the brightest mir point source ( within the assumed 1@xmath2 pointing accuracy) and cooler, extended sources dominate the luminosity.
* The time scale for a source at the core edge to migrate to the centre is comparable to the hot molecular core lifetime, so it is not possible to rule out large protostellar motions within the core.
* The authors used Monte Carlo simulations to populate 10 clusters using the Salpeter IMF until the available gas mass was exhausted, and found that it is difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the IMF.

• The sample consists of a nearly isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars at high redshift, which allows for a direct comparison of the anisotropy between the two types of objects.
• The data used in the paper are from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the seds were interpolated onto a common rest frame wavelength grid.
• The quasars and radio galaxies were averaged into a mean sed for each class of objects, and the individual seds were presented in a previous paper.
• The paper corrects for host galaxy emission in the radio galaxies using a combination of a moderately old elliptical galaxy sed and a hot blackbody for the AGN dust, and finds that the hot dust emission is obscured in radio galaxies while directly seen in quasars.
• The paper finds that the radio galaxies are systematically lower in infrared emission than the quasars, and that this difference can be explained by a single absorber and emitter (the dust torus) rather than line-of-sight extinction or a cold dust screen.

* The authors extend the result to the case of a bounded domain with a Dirichlet boundary condition and show that the principal eigenvalue of the fractional Laplace operator is bounded as a function of the boundary data.

The article considers the fractional Laplace operator @xmath4 defined as the generator of the semigroup of the isotropic @xmath81-stable Lvy process @xmath88 on @xmath49. The fractional Laplace operator is the closure of the operator @xmath86\nu(y)dy, where @xmath86 is a non-negative function satisfying @xmath87. The article proves that the principal eigenvalue of the fractional Laplace operator is bounded as a function of the boundary data @xmath35, @xmath36, and @xmath37.

The article uses conditioning suggested by a paper of Bogdan and Dyda @xcite, approximation techniques for flows given by Diperna and Lions in @xcite, and the properties of the green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of @xmath44 for @xmath47, @xmath48, and @xmath49. The article also employs the bilinear form of @xmath44 to estimate the principal eigenvalue.

The article concludes that the result of Berestycki et al. (2011) can be extended to the case of a bounded domain with a Dirichlet boundary condition, and the principal eigenvalue of the fractional Laplace operator is bounded as a function of the boundary data. This result has implications for the study of stochastic processes and the behavior of solutions to differential equations with non-local operators.",0

* The correlation between the continuum luminosity and the time lag of the BELs is well established, but there is a lower limit to the SMBH mass due to the lack of observations of low luminosity AGNs.

* Recent revisions to the correlation between the continuum luminosity and the SMBH mass have been made, but more observations are needed to establish a complete picture.

* The authors use numerical simulations to study the propagation of an HF EM wave into the ionosphere, with ionospheric parameters typical for the high-latitude EISCAT heating facility in Troms, Norway.

* The simulation neglects the field-aligned irregularities in the ionosphere and assumes a vertically stratified ion number density profile.
* The EM wave is injected vertically into the ionosphere with spatial variations only in the @xmath3 direction.

* The simulation shows that the HF EM wave propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere until it reaches the ionospheric layer.
* At the turning point of the r-x and l-o modes, the EM wave undergoes Faraday rotation due to the different dispersion properties of the two modes.

* The l-o mode oscillations at @xmath37 km are radiating EM waves with perpendicular electric field components, while the r-x mode is concentrated into a pulse with a single maximum at @xmath38 km.
* The leading part of the pulse is primarily r-x mode polarized, while its trailing part is l-o mode polarized.

* The simulation also shows the excitation of weak turbulence in the ionosphere, which is excited by the HF EM wave.
* The weak turbulence leads to the excitation of electrostatic waves, which are observed to have a wavelength of approximately 33 m and a frequency that decreases with increasing wavenumber.

* The paper highlights the importance of considering the interaction between the HF EM wave and the ionosphere in order to accurately model the propagation of the wave.

• These programs aim to speed the transition of technologies developed by DOD's S&T programs into acquisition programs, introduce innovative and cost-saving technologies developed inside and outside DOD, and field test technology prototypes.
• The programs have reported benefits, such as saving $780,000 per year in ammunition costs, accelerating the development of a solution 1-2 years earlier than anticipated, and doubling the compressor life of an engine in a sand environment.
• However, the programs have limited performance measures to gauge progress and return on investment, and the impact of the programs is difficult to determine due to a limited set of metrics and inconsistent tracking of project success.
• To ensure successful technology transition, programs must establish effective selection, management, and oversight processes, as well as disciplined and well-defined processes for selecting and managing projects.
• The level of detail and rigor associated with management processes may not be appropriate for smaller programs, but larger programs like the ACTD program and DARPA projects have developed tools to help sustain commitment.

1. The accuracy of detecting fetal pathology depends on the expertise of the sonographer and the limitations of ultrasound imaging.
* Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used in the diagnostic work-up of prenatal anomalies, particularly in cases of ventriculomegaly.
2. MRI can provide additional information on the normal and abnormal development of the cerebral cortex and can detect small deposits of intraventricular blood, which may suggest an intraventricular hemorrhage.
3. MRI is a sensitive technique for detecting corpus callosum dysgenesis and can screen for additional malformations such as cortical anomalies, periventricular nodular heteropia, and interhemispheric cysts.
4. Accurate characterization of additional anomalies is important for prognosis and parental counseling.
5. MRI is equally good for morphometric and volumetric assessment of the fossa posterior in cases of suspicious ultrasound findings.
6. It allows good evaluation of the vermis, cerebellar hemispheres, pedunculi, brainstem, 4th ventricle, tentorium cerebelli, and retrocerebellar space.
7. Fetal MRI has a limited role in assessing the size of cerebral ventricles except in cases where fetal position and calvarial ossification cause problems.
8. In the second trimester, MRI is useful for detecting small foci of brain hemorrhage or callosal anomalies in fetuses diagnosed with cerebral ventriculomegaly.
9. Later in pregnancy (over 25 weeks), MRI adds information on normal and pathological cortical development and maturation, depicts fossa posterior anomalies, and is a more sensitive imaging modality to detect white matter pathology.

* The type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose levels, which is caused by both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.
* The latest studies show that there are 366 million people with diabetes worldwide, and this number is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030 if no action is taken.
* The latest studies also showed that the esrra gene is a candidate gene involved in the pathogenesis of T2D.
* The mfn2 gene is also associated with T2D, and the c allele of rs2878677 in the mfn2 gene confers protection against T2D.
* Haplotypes in the mfn2 gene were also found to be associated with T2D, and individuals carrying the g-t-c-t-c haplotype have a higher risk of developing T2D.
* The interactions between genetic variants in the mfn2, esrra, and pgc-1 genes were also found to be associated with T2D.
* The present study confirmed that the g allele of rs873458 and the t allele of rs2878677 in the mfn2 gene are associated with a higher risk of T2D.

• In 1992, the National Institute of Health convened a consensus development conference to discuss the treatment of cholelithiasis and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
• After considering the current literature and discussion, the panel concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with no apparent increase in morbidity or mortality.
• The reduction in pain and disability resulting from laparoscopic cholecystectomy leads to a decrease in costs, as patients experience a shorter period of disability and a lower likelihood of lengthy hospital stays.
• Charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy often exceed those of open cholecystectomy, but this discrepancy can be attributed to the increased cost of converting laparoscopic procedures to open cholecystectomies due to complications during surgery.
• A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients found that the average charge for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies was $19,922, compared to $13,042 for open cholecystectomies, with a $6,880 charge attributed to laparoscopy.
• Decision tree and sensitivity analyses revealed that, in order for laparoscopic cholecystectomy to become cost-effective, a reduction in charges of $3,331 (or $12,680) would be needed, depending on the conversion rate.
• Vanek and Borguet's study demonstrated that conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy resulted in a 57% increase in total charges over laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with a mean total hospital charge of $16,070 for converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies.

• Different communities of biologists use different terminology, particularly with respect to the term ""function,"" which can be confusing.
• Websites such as LocusLink, Genecards, Eugenes, and Ensembl integrate information from diverse sources relevant to individual human genes.
• These databases allow researchers to browse sequence information, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene pathways, and descriptions of molecular and cellular function.
• Annotating the genomic landscape using homology can significantly reduce the complexity of the human genome, making it easier to navigate.
• Homology-based annotation indicates the approximate direction of future empirical determination of function, but it is not a precise map.

• The first completely sequenced genomes were annotated using searches of all available sequence databases, with each predicted gene product considered as a homolog.
• Although homologous genes may not always have similar functions, domains represent the finite vocabulary of protein evolution.
• InterPro combines the domain and motif sets of Prosite, Pfam, ProDom, Prints, and Smart in a hierarchical manner and provides annotation for 74% of all Swiss-Prot and Trembl entries.
• Automatic annotation of individual proteins or complete proteomes using domains is achieved using numerical representations of multiple sequence alignments.
• The contribution of domain identification to gene-function prediction will remain until reliable results from high-throughput studies on a more closely related organism, such as the mouse, are available.
• Deconvolution of human proteins into their constituent domains has played a major role in understanding the evolution of chordates.
• Three significant differences were detected between the repertoires of human domain families and those of other organisms.

3. *The epithelial lining of the adult airway progresses from proximal to distal in a stereotyped fashion, and cells capable of stem-like behavior in response to airway injury are present throughout the airway.
4. *Squamous cell carcinomas frequently arise from the more proximal tracheobronchial airways, yielding centrally located tumors that often exhibit elevated levels of k5 basal cells.
5. *The cell surface markers cd44 and mdr1 have been identified in a series of small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, and cells expressing these markers have been implicated in lung cancer progression and metastasis.
6. *The hierarchical or cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that relatively rare, multipotent cells gain unlimited proliferative potential that may then drive tumor growth.
7. *Stem cells are also known to express high levels of anti-apoptotic and drug-resistant proteins, which may explain why chemotherapy is effective in shrinking primary tumors but frequently ineffective against localized recurrence and metastatic disease.
8. *Recent studies have successfully identified cells within lung cancer specimens that exhibit stem-like properties, and cd133 cells isolated from freshly resected human lung cancer specimens can grow indefinitely in culture.
9. *The presence of cd133 lung cancer stem cells may warrant changes to chemotherapeutic regimens in patients, and measurement of the lung cancer stem cell fraction in a tumor could prove a useful modality for better differentiating between transient tumor debulking effects of chemotherapy and longer-lasting therapies.

• TADs are units of chromosomes that exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their cognate regulatory regions, and their boundaries are enriched for both housekeeping and developmentally regulated genes.
• The swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex, including the ATPase subunit Brg1, regulates tad boundary strength by positioning nucleosomes and recruiting factors such as Ctcf and topoisomerases.
• Loss of Brg1 results in reduced nucleosome occupancy at Ctcf-bound regions, which may disrupt chromatin accessibility and affect the integrity of tad boundaries.
• Topoisomerases, such as Top2b, interact with Brg1 and are required for the recruitment of Ctcf to tad boundaries, suggesting an interplay between these factors in genome organization.
• The association between Brg1 knockdown and reduction in tad boundary strength may be due to perturbations in the recruitment of Ctcf and topoisomerases, affecting the integrity of the chromatin structure and stiffness at tad boundaries.

1. Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength that increases the risk of fractures.
* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that affects the myelin sheath covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, leading to functional impairments such as visual impairment, abnormal walking mechanics, poor balance, muscle weakness, fatigue, and progressive immobility.
* MS affects mainly young adults (20-40 years) and its incidence is more frequent in women (approximately 2:1).
2. Bone remodeling maintains bone strength by removing damaged bone and replacing it with new bone, restoring bone's micro- and macroarchitecture.
* Chronic diseases such as MS may significantly disturb the process of bone modeling and remodeling, leading to bone loss and increased frequency of fractures.
3. Secondary osteoporosis and low-trauma fractures occur more frequently in patients with MS than in healthy controls.
* The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis in patients with MS are probably based on the progressive immobilization, long-term gcs treatment, vitamin D deficiency, skeletal muscle atrophy, and possibly on the presence of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of MS.
4. Cortical thinning and substantial decline of trabecular bone density account for increased bone fragility.
* The duration and degree of motor disability appear to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of secondary osteoporosis in patients with MS.

1. Dr. David Blaney of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales discussed the impact of Brexit on higher education in Wales.
* Brexit has already had an impact on Welsh higher education, with a 8% decrease in European Union (EU) student applications and a 9% decrease in non-EU student applications.
* The main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector are funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and uncertainty about the consequences of the review of fees and funding in England.
* The drop in EU student applications is partly due to the change in student support arrangements for EU students, which will have an effect on the attractiveness of Wales as a study destination.
* The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to re-balancing the policy of investment in higher education and addressing the funding pressures faced by Welsh institutions.
2. Bethan Owen of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales provided data on the changes in EU and non-EU student applications.
* EU student applications have decreased by 8%, contrasting with a 2% increase for English institutions.
* Non-EU student applications have also decreased by 9%, again contrasting with a 7% increase in England.
3. The reasons for the decrease in EU student applications are complex and include the change in student support arrangements and the perturbation caused by the media's Anglocentric nature.
* The price sensitivities of students also play a role in the decision to study in Wales, with fee levels denoting quality in the student mind.
4. The drop in non-EU student applications is also influenced by the mix of institutions in Wales and the perception of how welcome overseas and international students are.
