0,"1. The transport properties of nonlinear, non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, are not well understood. Ratchet systems are asymmetric periodic potentials that cause directed transport of an ensemble of particles.
2. The interest in ratchet systems comes from the possibility of extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations, as observed in biological systems. Recent focus has been on deterministic chaotic ratchets and Hamiltonian ratchets.
3. Chaotic systems are sensitive to initial conditions, and their behavior, including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior, depends on system parameters. Phase-space structure is complex, consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas or co-existing attractors.
4. Mateos considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle and showed that the average velocity could change direction depending on the amplitude of the periodic forcing. He conjectured a connection between current direction reversal and bifurcations in trajectory dynamics.
5. Barbi and Salerno argued that current reversals could occur without bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior, suggesting an alternative origin related to the stability properties of rotating periodic orbits.
6. The dynamics of chaotic systems are not always ergodic, meaning that the behavior of a single particle may not represent the ensemble behavior. Ensemble characteristics and statistics can significantly impact transport properties.
7. Studying the ensemble-dependence of currents in chaotic ratchets is essential for understanding their behavior and potential experimental validation, as real-world experiments are conducted over finite time and ensembles.
8. The investigation in this paper finds evidence for a generalized version of Mateos' conjecture: bifurcations in trajectory dynamics are associated with abrupt changes in the current, which may or may not lead to current direction reversals.",0
1," * The text discusses the discovery and analysis of extrasolar planetary systems.
 
 * More than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered, many of which have moderate to high eccentricities.
 
 * Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets, including planet-planet scattering and interactions with stellar companions.
 
 * The Kozai mechanism, which can induce large-amplitude oscillations in a planet's eccentricity, has been suggested as a possible explanation for the high eccentricity of certain planets.
 
 * The text also discusses the detection of low-mass companions in known planetary systems and the use of test particle simulations to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional planets in these systems.
 
 * The authors present updated Keplerian orbital solutions for four planetary systems and summarize the data used in their analysis.
 
 * They also discuss the discovery of a t dwarf companion to the star hd 3651 and the possible detection of a trend in the radial velocity data that may be due to this companion.
 
 * The text also presents new observations of the star hd 37605 and the detection of an acceleration that may indicate the presence of a distant orbiting body.
 
 * The authors also discuss the results of dynamical simulations for six planetary systems, which show that there are regions in which additional objects can exist and that protected resonances are present in some systems.",0
2,"1. The LEP experiments at the resonance of the Z boson have tested the Standard Model (SM) at the quantum level, measuring the Z decay into fermion pairs with high precision. The agreement between LEP data and SM predictions has constrained new physics at the Z pole.
2. The physics of the Z boson is expected to play a central role in the frontier of particle physics if the next generation Z factory is realized, which can generate Z events several orders of magnitude higher than that of LEP. This factory can be realized in the Gigaz option of the International Linear Collider (ILC), which corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of the Z boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line.
3. The LEP data has been used to set constraints on the branching ratios of rare Z decays, such as the flavor changing (FC) processes, which were found to be severely suppressed in the SM but can be greatly enhanced in new physics models. The Z decay into light Higgs bosons has also been studied and found to have a large rate in new physics models.
4. Recent studies have motivated the investigation of new models, such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and the Nearly Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), where a light CP-odd Higgs boson with a singlet-dominant component may naturally arise from the spontaneous breaking of some approximate global symmetry. These non-minimal supersymmetric models can avoid the muon g-2 problem and alleviate the little hierarchy problem.
5. The latest experiments have more stringently constrained the properties of the light Higgs boson, making it worthwhile to update previous studies. The lower bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass can be significantly relaxed in extensions of the SM, such as the CP-odd Higgs boson in the NMSSM, NMSSM, and Lepton-specific 2HDM.
6. The rare Z decays Z → γA0, Z → A0A0, Z → A0h, and Z → A0Z can proceed by Feynman diagrams with CP-even Higgs bosons as intermediate states. The contributions from loops mediated by quarks/leptons and sparticles have been calculated and found to be important in",0
3,"1. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model that solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the GUT scale. It also predicts the existence of superpartners of the SM particles, with their masses expected to be below the TeV range. Mechanisms of SUSY breaking and its mediation to the MSSM sector are important problems in SUSY phenomenology.
2. The no-scale type Kähler potential is a type of Kähler potential in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated, and all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes. This scenario is highly predictive and has various phenomenological consequences with a few parameters. It is also interesting from the viewpoint of the SUSY flavor problem because the couplings of the hidden sector and the observable sector are flavor blind, and contributions of SUSY particles to FCNC are suppressed.
3. In the no-scale scenario, the degrees of freedom of SUSY particle mass spectrum are limited because only non-zero soft SUSY breaking masses are gaugino masses and Higgs mixing mass at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given. Phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated, mainly focusing on the mass spectrum. Direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint (i.e., a charged particle cannot be the LSP if the R-parity is conserved) were considered, and the allowed region in the parameter space was identified.
4. The paper further constrains the no-scale models from the Higgs mass bound and the result. Indications of these bounds for the Tevatron are also discussed. The paper concludes by briefly reviewing phenomenological aspects of SUSY models with no-scale boundary condition, mainly indications of the cosmological bound and direct search limit at LEP 2. The paper considers three cases: universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale (minimal scenario), universal gaugino masses are given above the GUT scale, and non-universal gaugino masses are given at the GUT scale.",0
4," * Colliding plane waves (CPW) result in spacelike singularities, but this can be weakened by cross polarization prior to collision.
 * A solution by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) has a Cauchy horizon (CH) instead of a spacelike singularity, which led to a literature on horizon stability.
 * CH formed in CPW spacetimes was shown to be unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations by Yurtsever and CX.
 * Collision of pure electromagnetic (EM) waves must have a special significance for singularity formation.
 * A solution by Bell and Szekeres (BS) describes the collision of two linearly polarized step EM waves, with a removable singularity in the interaction region and essential curvature singularities on the null boundaries.
 * A cross polarized version of the BS (CPBS) solution was found, with regular Weyl scalars in the interaction region but singularities on the null boundaries.
 * The paper tests the validity of a CH stability conjecture by Helliwell and Konkowski (HK) using the CPBS solution with various added test fields.
 * The paper also discusses the stability of quasiregular singularities in maximal four-dimensional spacetimes, classified as quasiregular (QR), scalar curvature (SC), and non-scalar curvature (NSC) singularities.
 * The HK conjecture suggests that an infinite back-reaction will render a CH unstable and convert it into a scalar singularity.",0
5,"• Deep X-ray surveys (CDF-N, CDF-S) have detected normal galaxies with X-ray emission likely dominated by X-ray binaries, hot interstellar gas, or low-luminosity AGN. These galaxies contribute significantly to the X-ray background (XRB) and are the most numerous extragalactic X-ray sources.
• The Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) survey has reached the depths necessary to detect individually many normal galaxies, allowing for the study of their X-ray properties and evolution up to a look-back time of ~12.2 Gyr. This enables the investigation of the X-ray luminosity per unit optical luminosity as a function of redshift, which can constrain models of X-ray binary production in galaxies.
• Statistical methods such as stacking are used to estimate the emission at extremely faint flux levels for individual galaxies. This has led to the detection of X-ray emission from the average L* galaxy in the Hubble Deep Field-North and a study of X-ray emission from Lyman break galaxies.
• The study presented here extends the analysis to the entire CDF-N plus flanking fields region, focusing on galaxies at z = 0.5 to 1.5 due to extensive spectroscopic redshift coverage and superb imaging. The goal is to place observational constraints on the evolution of the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity for normal spiral galaxies up to z = 1.5.
• The study also aims to constrain the fraction of the diffuse XRB explained by galaxies lingering just below the CDF-N detection threshold, contributing to the XRB and providing insights into the contribution of normal galaxies to the XRB.",1
6," * Quantum systems can exhibit non-classical correlations, which can be categorized into different types of non-locality.
 * Non-separable or entangled states are those that cannot be expressed as a mixture of product states of the constituents.
 * Bell-nonlocality is the strongest form of non-locality, where measurement correlations can violate a Bell inequality, indicating the violation of local causality.
 * EPR-steering is a weaker form of non-locality, which is the only way to verify the existence of entanglement if one of the parties or their detectors cannot be trusted.
 * A bipartite state is said to be EPR-steerable if it allows for a demonstration of EPR-steering.
 * The set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non-EPR-steerable states, which is in turn a strict subset of the set of Bell-local states.
 * The phenomenon of steering has been studied using the steering ellipsoid formalism, but no relation between the steering ellipsoid and EPR-steerability has been determined.
 * The paper investigates EPR-steerability of the class of two-qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed, and obtains two sufficient conditions for these states to be EPR-steerable.
 * The paper also derives two asymmetric steering inequalities for arbitrary two-qubit states, and conjectures that a deterministic LHS model is optimal for projective measurements on the class of two-qubit states studied.",0
7,"1. The idea of using an electron's spin to encode binary information was first proposed in the mid-1990s, although it is unclear who first suggested it.
2. Encoding information in spin has several potential advantages, including lower power dissipation, reduced susceptibility to noise, and the possibility of faster operation.
3. In 1994, a concrete scheme for realizing a classical universal logic gate (NAND) using three spins was proposed.
4. Spin devices have a metastable state that can cause problems in pipelined architectures, as exchange interaction is bidirectional and cannot ensure unidirectional flow of logic signals.
5. A more elegant solution to this problem was proposed in 1996, inspired by charge coupled device (CCD) arrays, which use clocking to impose unidirectionality in time.
6. However, implementing this solution in practice is challenging due to the need for precise alignment of gate pads and the energy dissipation caused by moving charges into and out of the gate pads.
7. Reversible logic gates that are not constrained by the Landauer limit are being explored as a way to overcome the challenge of power dissipation in spin-based devices.",0
8,"• The text discusses the challenges in modeling the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variable (CV) stars, which are binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a low-mass main sequence star. The two main issues are the lack of systems in the 2-3 hour period range (the ""period gap"") and the sharp cut-off at around 77 minutes.

• The authors investigate ways to increase the period minimum and to ""hide"" the spike by introducing a spread of minimum period values in the CV population. They consider a form of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) where the angular momentum is lost as a consequence of the mass transferred from the secondary.

• The authors also consider the effect of a tidal deformation of the secondary, which can increase the minimum period. They find that a deformation factor of around 1.18 is required to raise the minimum period to the observed value of 80 minutes. However, this is somewhat larger than the intuitive expectation from Kepler's law and Roche geometry. They also consider the possibility of magnetic pressure inside the star as a physical mechanism that could cause a deformation factor above the value of 1.06.",1
9,"• Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a compact group with a disturbed intragroup medium due to complex interactions and harassment.
• A large-scale intergalactic shock wave has been produced by the high-velocity collision of an intruder galaxy with the group's intergalactic medium.
• The shock-heated gas is responsible for the X-ray emitting gas, and the region is powered by strong shocks, not star formation.
• The main elements of SQ include a primary shock, an intruder galaxy, a Seyfert 2 galaxy, and other group members.
• The discovery of extremely powerful pure rotational H2 line emission using the Spitzer Space Telescope has sparked interest in the SQ system.
• The collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows describes H2 formation out of the multiphase, shocked gas, and an efficient cooling channel for high-speed shocks.
• The SQ detection has led to the discovery of several other systems exhibiting similarly strong H2 emission, and a large subset of local 3CR radio galaxies have dominant MIR rotational H2 lines.",1
10," * The short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) @xmath4al was present during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula and may have been injected into the presolar cloud or solar nebula by a supernova or AGB star shock wave.
* Initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity caused by SLRI injection can be reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disk due to large-scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and small particles.
* Other elements and their isotopes suggest a well-mixed solar nebula, but stable oxygen isotopes appear to have been spatially heterogeneous during the early phases of planet formation.
* The leading explanation for generating oxygen anomalies is UV photodissociation of CO molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula, leading to isotopic fractionation between gas-phase and solid-phase oxygen atoms.
* MGU disks can accomplish early large-scale transport of refractory particles from the inner to the outer solar nebula, and are likely involved in FU Orionis outbursts and gas giant planet formation.
* The numerical models presented in the text were computed with a three-dimensional gravitational hydrodynamics code and seek to follow the deviations from uniformity of a color field, which represents isotopes carried by the disk gas or small particles.",1
11," * The text describes a search for new particles using data from the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.
 
 * The search includes a general search for new particles that decay to dijets, as well as targeted searches for specific particles such as axigluons, excited quarks, color octet technirhos, new gauge bosons, and scalar diquarks.
 
 * The search uses data from four triggers with integrated luminosities ranging from 0.089 pb@xmath0 to 69.8 pb@xmath0.
 
 * Jets are defined using a fixed cone clustering algorithm and corrected for detector response, energy lost outside the cone, and underlying event.
 
 * The search looks for narrow resonances in the dijet mass distribution, and uses a fit to a smooth function to determine the QCD background.
 
 * The search also considers the angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region around 550 gev / c@xmath1, which is compatible with both QCD alone and QCD + 5% excited quark.
 
 * The search sets limits on new particle production, and excludes topgluons of width @xmath57 in the mass region @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1, @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1, and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1.",0
12,"1. * The first evidence of the universe's accelerated expansion was observed through supernovae type Ia (SNIA) being fainter than expected.
2. * This observation has been confirmed by various independent measurements, including temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), inhomogeneities in the matter distribution, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak lensing (WL), and gamma-ray bursts.
3. * The accelerated expansion is attributed to a new energy density component with negative pressure, known as dark energy (DE). The nature of this unknown matter field is being studied extensively.
4. * The current observations are consistent with a cosmological constant being the origin of the DE driving the accelerated expansion and a dark matter (DM) component responsible for the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.
5. * The concordance model, also known as Lambda-CDM, is the current standard cosmological model, but it faces theoretical challenges, such as the fine-tuning problem and the coincidence problem.
6. * Interacting dark sector models have been introduced to address these issues, where DM and DE do not evolve separately but interact with each other.
7. * The interaction between DM and DE affects the overall evolution of the universe, expansion history, growth of matter and baryon density perturbations, temperature anisotropies of the CMB, and the evolution of the gravitational potential at late times.
8. * These observables can be used to constrain the interaction with observations of the background evolution and the emergence of large-scale structure.
9. * Future and ongoing observational facilities, such as DES, DESI, Euclid, LSST, SKA, and CORE, will help measure or constrain the interaction between DM and DE.
10. * The text also discusses various cosmological models, experiments, and surveys, including the hubble parameter, baryon acoustic oscillations, weak lensing, redshift-space distortions, and the growth of cosmic structure.",0
13,"• Type 1 AGN spectra show a diversity of broad and narrow emission lines that provide insights into the structure and kinematics of photoionized gas in the vicinity of the central massive object. Broad emission lines like Hβ are thought to arise in or near an accretion disk acting as the fuel reservoir for the central supermassive black hole.
• The text discusses two populations of Type 1 AGN. Population A shows the smallest broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ = 1000 - 4000) and includes narrow-line Seyfert 1 sources (FWHM < 2000). Population B sources show larger broad-line widths (FWHM Hβ = 4000 - 12000) and a mix of radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. Broad-line profile shifts and asymmetries are known, and narrow emission lines like [OIII]5007 are generally considered a reliable measure of the local quasar rest frame.
• The text also discusses the correlation between FWHM FeII and FWHM Hβ and the effect of collisional quenching on Hβ emission in sources with strong FeII emission. Systematic line shifts, such as the blueshift of high-ionization lines relative to low-ionization lines in Population A sources and the recently proposed systematic redshift of FeII relative to [OIII]5007 in a majority of Type 1 quasars, are important for constraining models of the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region.
• The authors question the claim of a systematic redshift of FeII relative to [OIII]5007 in Type 1 quasars, as they found no evidence for such a shift in their sample of bright SDSS DR5 quasars. They suggest that the discrepancy in conclusions may be due to differences in how signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) was computed and that individual source spectra may not allow for convincing conclusions about FeII shift and width due to large uncertainties. The authors argue that generating high S/N composite spectra is the best recourse for confirming or refuting the existence of a systematic FeII redshift.",1
14,"1. Nuclear multifragmentation is the study of the behavior of atomic nuclei under extreme conditions, and is being researched both theoretically and experimentally due to the similarities between the forces within a nucleus and the van der Waals forces.
2. One area of interest is the possibility of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter, similar to the phase transition that occurs in boiling water.
3. The first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve, which can provide evidence of this phase transition, was reported in 1995 by the ALADIN group.
4. However, subsequent experiments by EOS and INDRA have produced slightly different caloric curves, with some showing a plateau-like region and others not.
5. These discrepancies can be attributed to both the precision of the experimental measurements and the finite-size effects of the caloric curve, which can vary depending on the type of reaction.
6. Recent reevaluations of the ALADIN data have brought corrections to the kinetic energies of emitted neutrons and the energies of spectator parts.
7. Theoretical calculations suggest that there is a significant nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies, which may belong to both pre-equilibrium and pre-break-up stages.
8. To accurately distinguish between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies, accurate theoretical descriptions of the break-up stage and sequential secondary particle emission are necessary.",0
15,"1. The solar corona is heated to a temperature of about 12 million kelvins, which is much higher than the temperature of the visible surface of the sun.
2. Magnetic fields or waves are believed to play a key role in heating the solar corona.
3. The primary energy source for this heating is located in the convection zone below the solar photosphere.
4. The debate is focused on whether the energy to heat the corona comes from dissipation of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or from numerous small-scale magnetic reconnection events called nanoflares.
5. Two types of magnetic disturbances in coronal structures can be generated by the interaction of the magnetic field with convective flows in or below the photosphere.
6. These magnetic disturbances can produce MHD waves that propagate into magnetic flux tubes and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere or corona.
7. Alternatively, random motions of magnetic loop foot-points can produce twisting and braiding of coronal field lines, which generates field-aligned electric currents that can be dissipated resistively.
8. High-frequency MHD waves have been sought using the Fe XIV green ""line"" at 530.3 nm and the Fe X red ""line"" at 637.5 nm.
9. Observations of high-frequency intensity oscillations of the coronal structures have been made using ground-based equipment, but space missions capable of comparable time resolution measurements are not yet available.
10. A new setup will be used to search for high-frequency coronal oscillations using the mid-sized coronagraph at the Lomnicky Peak Observatory and the SECIS instrument.",0
16,"1. * Water vapor is an important molecule for the chemistry of interstellar and circumstellar clouds, and the 6@xmath8 - 5@xmath9 masing transition of H2O at 22 GHz has been used to trace high excitation gas around star forming regions and evolved stars. However, this line does not provide information on the role of H2O at large spatial scales.
2. * Other H2O lines have been detected from ground or airborne based telescopes, but only the 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition at 183 GHz has been used to map the emission of H2O at very large spatial scale. This map of the Orion molecular cloud is 6 orders of magnitude larger than the size of the spots detected at 22 GHz and provides the first estimate of the H2O abundance in different large scale components of the Orion molecular cloud.
3. * The ISO satellite has provided the opportunity to observe thermal lines of water in the middle and far-infrared, and mapping of the SgrB2 molecular cloud has shown that water vapor is an ubiquitous molecule in molecular clouds with an abundance of 10@xmath7.
4. * The 3@xmath11 - 2@xmath12 transition of H2O at 183 GHz has been used to map the emission of H2O at very large spatial scale, but the iso observations have drawbacks such as limited spectral resolution, high opacity of the thermal lines of H2O, and poor angular resolution in the far-infrared.
5. * An important aid in deriving H2O abundances could come from the observation of another masing transition of H2O with similar properties to those of the 183 GHz line. The 325 GHz line of H2O was observed in the direction of Orion IRC2 and other molecular clouds, but no maps were obtained.
6. * The present data show the importance of ground-based observations of H2O in deriving the abundance of H2O in molecular clouds and in providing useful constraints on the physical conditions of the emitting regions. The ground-based observations provide much finer spatial resolution than ISO or SWAS, and an estimate of x(H2O) as accurate as that",0
17,"1. * Threshold nets are obtained by assigning weights to nodes and connecting them based on the combined weights exceeding a threshold.
2. * They can be produced with arbitrary degree distributions, including scale-free, and encompass a wide variety of architectures.
3. * Threshold nets have been studied extensively in graph theory and have recently gained attention in statistical and non-linear physics.
4. * They can be encoded more elegantly using a two-letter sequence, with nodes of type @xmath9 connecting to none of the existing nodes and nodes of type @xmath10 connecting to all existing nodes.
5. * Threshold graphs have a modular structure, with subsequences of @xmath10 nodes forming cliques and nodes of type @xmath9 connecting to subsequent @xmath10 nodes.
6. * Given the sequence of a threshold net, important structural benchmarks such as degree distribution, triangles, betweenness centrality, and the spectrum and eigenvectors of the graph laplacian can be computed.
7. * The idea is to study a broader class of nets that can be constructed from a sequence of letters by deterministic rules of connectivity.
8. * These sequence nets have desirable attributes such as modularity, easily computable structural measures, and a high degree of compressibility.",0

- The lasso method for variable selection in high-dimensional data analysis uses an L1-norm penalty.
- The lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution, and the L1 penalty can be transformed into a Laplace prior, which can be expressed as a Gaussian scale mixture.
- This has led to Bayesian developments of the lasso and its variants, as well as work on nonconvex penalization under a parametric Bayesian framework.
- The paper discusses the use of subordinators, one-dimensional Lévy processes that are almost surely non-decreasing, in Bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios.
- The authors model latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators, which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters, and show that both gamma and Poisson subordinators are limiting cases of two families of compound Poisson subordinators.
- The authors establish a connection between two nonconvex penalty functions, log and exp, and the Laplace transforms of gamma and Poisson subordinators.
- The paper also discusses the use of subordinators in the construction of sparsity-inducing priors, specifically using stable subordinators and inverted-beta subordinators for modeling joint priors of regression coefficients.
- The authors propose a nonparametric approach for normal variance mixtures and show that it is closely related to Lévy processes.
- The paper concludes with a discussion of the use of subordinators in Bayesian sparse learning problems and the application of Lévy processes to Bayesian linear regression.
- The authors also devise an ECME (expectation/conditional maximization either) algorithm for finding the sparse solution in Bayesian linear regression.

19,"1. The text discusses the use of nonlinear current response as a probe of order parameter symmetry in superconductors, specifically in the case of two-band superconductors like MgB2. It highlights the importance of considering strong electron-phonon coupling and dimensionality in understanding the nonlinear response.
2. The authors present strong-coupling correction formulas for three dimensions and discuss the strong coupling effects seen in the figure for pb, a strong electron-phonon coupling superconductor. They also provide formulas for estimating strong coupling corrections.
3. The text discusses the behavior of the nonlinear coefficient in the two-band case, which is the sum of two partial currents.

20,"1. The classification problem is important in time series data mining, and the 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is a well-performing classifier for time series data.
2. The selection of an appropriate distance measure is crucial for 1-NN classification, and the DTW distance has been shown to be more appropriate than the commonly used Euclidean distance.
3. The Sakoe-Chiba band (S-C band) was originally introduced to speed up DTW calculation and later used as a global constraint for DTW.
4. The size of the global constraint of the S-C band depends on the properties of the data, and recent work has shown that the classification accuracy depends solely on this global constraint.
5. The Ratanamahatana-Keogh band (R-K band) generalizes the global constraint model and allows for multi-bands representing each class of data.
6. A learning algorithm is needed to discover the best multi R-K bands, and the original work of R-K band proposed a hill climbing search algorithm with two heuristic functions.
7. Two new learning algorithms, band boundary extraction and iterative learning, are proposed to solve the overfitting problem of the learning algorithm.
8. The band boundary extraction method obtains the maximum, mean, and mode of the paths positions on the DTW distance matrix, and the iterative learning adjusts band structures to a silhouette index.
9. The proposed time series classification algorithm uses 1-NN with DTW distance and multi R-K bands as a global constraint, selected by the two proposed learning algorithms.

The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles has been successful in describing nature at the electroweak scale, and the recent discovery of a new particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) strengthens its correctness. However, there is still no direct evidence of physics beyond the SM reported from the LHC.
2. There is an anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon g-2) that has been precisely measured experimentally and compared with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions. The estimated discrepancies between the SM predictions and the measured value are consistently more than 3.xmath10, which could be a hint of new physics beyond the SM.

22,"1. Entanglement in quantum multipartite systems is unique to the quantum world and plays a crucial role in quantum information processing.
2. The study of entanglement's essential features and dynamical behavior under decoherence has gained significant attention in recent years.
3. Entanglement sudden death (ESD) has been observed in qubits under Markovian decoherence, where entanglement disappears in a finite time, while coherence is lost asymptotically.
4. Further studies have shown that revived entanglement and finite residual entanglement can occur after ESD, which can play constructive roles in quantum information protocols.
5. The lost entanglement of qubits is exclusively transferred to the reservoirs under Markovian amplitude-damping decoherence dynamics, accompanied by entanglement sudden birth (ESB) in the reservoirs.
6. A similar situation occurs for spin entanglement when the spin degree of freedom interacts with its momentum degree of freedom.
7. The entanglement dynamics in a double Jaynes-Cummings model shows that entanglement is transferred periodically among all bipartite partitions, and an identity is satisfied at any time.
8. A non-Markovian effect can lead to the stable distribution of entanglement among all bipartite subsystems, and ESD is not always accompanied by the occurrence of ESB in reservoirs.
9. The distribution of entanglement among bipartite subsystems depends on the explicit property of the reservoir and its coupling to the qubit.
10. The identity about the entanglement in the whole system can be satisfied at any time, revealing the profound physics of entanglement dynamics under decoherence.",0
23,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful flashes of gamma rays that occur randomly in the sky and are observed using X-gamma ray detectors aboard satellites.
2. GRBs are believed to be at cosmological distances, with measured red shifts up to 4.5, and are associated with huge energy releases. The two most likely explanations for these events are the collapse of a very massive star (hypernova) and the coalescence of a compact binary system.
3. In both cases, emission of gravitational waves (GWs) is expected to be associated with these events. The duration of a GW burst is predicted to be a few milliseconds for a variety of sources, including coalescing and merging black holes and/or neutron star binaries.
4. The present sensitivity for 1 ms GW pulses of the best GW antennas with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equal to unity is not sufficient to detect a gravitational signal associated with a single GRB. However, detection of a signal associated with the sum of many events could be more realistic.
5. A program has been launched to study the presence of correlations between GRB events detected with BeppoSAX and the output signals from gravitational antennas Nautilus and Explorer. The analysis uses an algorithm based on cross-correlating the outputs of two GW detectors, coping with the problem of the unknown possible time difference between GRB and GW bursts and unmodelled noise.
6. The Rome group operates two resonant bar detectors, Explorer and Nautilus, and the main characteristics of the two detectors are presented. The agreement between the values of the simulated input signals and the values calculated using the model shows that the model is correct. The experimental method and the model for the averaged correlation at zero delay time are presented, and the values of GW amplitude consistent with the observation are inferred.",0

25,"1. Hadron production at large transverse momentum in high-energy collisions is traditionally described in a two-step process involving hard scattering of partons followed by fragmentation of the scattered parton to the detected hadron.
2. The first step is calculable in perturbative QCD, while the second step uses fragmentation functions determined phenomenologically.
3. However, this production mechanism has been found to be inadequate for particle production at intermediate transverse momentum in heavy-ion collisions.
4. A new hadronization process, recombination of partons, is shown to be more appropriate, especially when soft partons are involved.
5. The purpose of the paper is to introduce the notion of shower partons and determine their distributions to represent phenomenological fragmentation functions in terms of recombination.
6. The concept of shower partons is not new, but previous attempts to generate them in pQCD processes cannot be easily related to shower partons and their hadronization in the recombination model.
7. The paper aims to quantify the properties of shower partons and illustrate the importance of their recombination with thermal partons in heavy-ion collisions.
8. The actual application of the shower parton distributions developed in the paper to heavy-ion collisions will be considered elsewhere.",0

2. The authors propose a new method for solving this problem based on convex-concave decomposition and linearization techniques, which exploits the convex substructure of the problem.
3. The authors also propose a new local optimization method for solving the nonconvex semidefinite programming problem, which approximates the feasible set of the nonconvex problem by a sequence of inner positive semidefinite convex approximation sets.
4. The paper generalizes the inner convex approximation method in a previous paper from scalar optimization to nonlinear semidefinite programming and modifies the algorithm by using a regularization technique to ensure strict descent.
5. The authors prove the convergence of the algorithm to a stationary point under mild conditions and provide two particular ways to form an overestimate for bilinear matrix-valued mappings.

27,"1. The Dirac-Kähler formulation of fermionic field theory is a valuable tool in extracting the geometric meaning of continuum vector theories, but regularizing calculations requires the introduction of a discrete differential geometry scheme with the same properties as the continuum and a correct continuum limit. Several discrete schemes have been proposed, including Becher and Joos' use of a lattice and non-local operators, Kanamori and Kawamoto's use of a lattice and non-commutativity between fields and discrete forms, Balachandran et al.'s use of a quantized phase space leading to a fuzzy coordinate space, and Adams' use of two parallel lattices to maintain locality and a finite element scheme.
2. Adams' proposal is promising for describing chiral symmetry and exact flavor projection in the Dirac-Kähler formulation, but requires the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator. The proposal is built upon in the paper to evaluate the path integral for this formulation, considering the effects of chiral and flavor projection.
3. In lattice quantum chromodynamics (Lattice QCD) calculations, the staggered fermion formulation is commonly used to describe fermions and address the problem of fermion doubling. The continuous Dirac-Kähler formulation is regarded as providing the continuum limit for the staggered fermion formulation, so a discrete Dirac-Kähler formulation with continuum properties can offer insight into developing non-degenerate, doubler-free fermionic field theories for the lattice.
4. The paper shows how the two lattices of Adams' proposal can be used to describe chiral symmetry in the associated Dirac-Kähler formulation and how the idea of using more than one lattice can be extended to describe exact flavor projection, which necessitates the introduction of two new structures of lattice and a new operator. The paper also discusses the implications of this formulation for chiral symmetry and the path integral.",0

A cognitive radio network allows secondary users to transmit on the same frequency band as primary users, as long as the interference power at the primary receivers is below a certain limit. Information-theoretic security involves using the secrecy capacity to transmit messages while keeping the eavesdropper ignorant of the transmitted information.

• The text also discusses the use of collaborative relay beamforming to improve the secrecy rates in cognitive radio networks. The authors formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a quasiconvex optimization problem, which can be solved through convex semidefinite programming. They also propose two sub-optimal null space beamforming schemes to reduce the computational complexity. The authors consider a cognitive relay channel with a source, a destination, a primary user, an eavesdropper, and multiple relays, and assume that the relays work synchronously to perform beamforming. They derive the optimal beamforming solution that maximizes the secrecy rate in the cognitive relay channel using semidefinite programming with a two-dimensional search for both total and individual power constraints.",1

	• The paper discusses the benefits of maintaining conformal invariance when quantizing the Maxwell field in conformally flat spaces (CFSs). A classical conformally invariant field cannot distinguish between two CFSs locally, so the authors propose keeping the invariance during quantization. This allows for a free field in a CFS to behave like it does in flat space, and the Wightman two-point functions can be related to their Minkowskian counterparts.
	• The authors use Dirac's six-cone formalism and realize all CFSs as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six-dimensional Lorentzian space. They introduce auxiliary fields and use the Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme to deal with the gauge freedom of the Maxwell field. They also use a well-suited coordinate system to write down the conformally invariant CFS formulas in a Minkowskian form.
	• The paper provides a set of Wightman two-point functions for Maxwell and auxiliary fields in CFSs. The authors solve the dynamical system, explicitly construct the quantum field, and write down the two-point functions. They also discuss the infinitesimal conformal action on the fields and their invariant scalar product.

The game has been shown to have deep connections to number theory, algebra, and combinatorics, and has the ability to simulate classical computer functions and solve theoretically solvable computational problems.
2. The game can also model a pile of particles that falls when there are too many particles stacked at any point, a problem known as the deterministic fixed-energy sandpile. This is a subset of the more general study of spatially extended dynamical systems, which exhibit self-organized criticality and display properties of real-life systems such as noise, fractal patterns, and power law distribution.
3. The text establishes lemmas about the parallel chip-firing game on general simple connected graphs, including bounds on the number of chips on any single vertex in games with nontrivial period and a necessary and sufficient condition for a period to occur.
4. The text finds, with proof, every possible period for the complete bipartite graph and constructs positions on the complete k-partite graph with period n for all n.

2. The fireshell model has been used to analyze GRB 090510, which assumes that the gamma-ray and GeV components originate from different physical processes. The prompt emission is modeled as collisions of baryon-accelerated outflows with the ambient medium, while the GeV emission is attributed to matter accretion onto the newly-born BH.
3. The analysis of GRB 090510 indicates the presence of three distinct episodes: the precursor (p)-GRB, the prompt emission, and the GeV emission. The p-GRB spectrum is best-fitted by a comptonized component, interpreted as a convolution of thermal spectra originating in a dyadotorus.
4. The prompt emission analysis allows for the determination of inhomogeneities in the circumburst medium (CBM) and the estimation of an averaged CBM density. The late X-ray emission of GRB 090510 does not follow the characteristic patterns expected in binary-driven hypernova (BDHN) events.
5. The GeV emission occurs at the end of the p-GRB emission and is initially concurrent with the prompt emission. This sequence occurs in both s-GRBs and BDHNe. The delayed long-lasting GeV emission in GRB 090510 is one of the most intense ever observed in any GRB.
6. The self-consistency of the entire procedure has been verified by estimating the cosmological redshift of the source, which is consistent with the spectroscopically measured value.
7. The main result of this article is that the dyadotorus manifests itself by the p-GRB emission and clearly precedes the prompt emission phase, as well as the GeV emission originating from the newly-formed BH. This contrasts with the usual assumption that the BH precedes the GRB emission. The unique condition of generating a jetted GeV emission in such a well-defined scenario of a newly",0

2. The authors also discuss the effect of new physics on the renormalization of the SM, specifically in the context of a real scalar triplet (TM) model and a left-right (LR) symmetric model. They show that the dependence on scalar masses in the W boson mass is quadratic and demonstrate that the triplet is non-decoupling.
3. The authors present the scalar potential of a model with a triplet and a doublet, and derive the conditions for the vacuum solutions in the neutral and charged Higgs sectors. They also discuss the mass spectrum of the scalar fields in the model.
4. The authors show that for the triplet to decouple, a dimensionless coupling constant must become strong, leading to the breakdown of perturbation theory. They also discuss the case where a symmetry is imposed to forbid certain terms in the scalar potential, which would reduce the number of input parameters needed.
5. The authors present numerical results for the W boson mass as a function of the top quark mass in the SM, TM, and LR model, and show the effect of the triplet on the dependence of the W boson mass on the top quark mass. They also discuss the implications of their results for Higgs searches.",0

An exp-algebraic curve is an equivalence class of log-Riemann surface structures of finite type, where two meromorphic functions on a punctured compact Riemann surface inducing log-Riemann surface structures of finite type are considered equivalent if the meromorphic function is holomorphic on the compact surface. An exp-algebraic curve is given by the data of a punctured compact Riemann surface and equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions with poles at the punctures.
3. A meromorphic function on a Riemann surface with exponential singularities of types h\_1, ..., h\_n at points p\_1, ..., p\_n defines a degree zero line bundle together with a transcendental section of this line bundle which is non-zero on the punctured surface.

The goal is to develop self-consistent electronic structure algorithms that can explore all space of parameters where dopings or degeneracy itself is not fixed, as this is crucial for calculating properties of realistic solid-state systems.</summary>
2. <summary>The text also discusses the need for fast scans of the entire parameter space to determine the interaction for a given doping, degeneracy, and bandwidth via the solution of the general multiorbital Anderson impurity model (AIM). However, present approaches based on non-crossing approximation (NCA) or iterative perturbation theory (IPT) are unable to provide the solution to this problem due to a limited number of regimes where these methods can be applied. The quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique is a promising method, but it has limitations such as being unable to cope with multiplet interactions and its applicability being limited to a small number of orbitals or unphysically large temperatures due to its computational cost.</summary>
3. <summary>The paper proposes an interpolative approach for the self-energy in the general multiorbital situation, which is not an attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem, but rather a follow-up of the ideology of LDA theory where approximations were designed by analytical fits to QMC simulations for homogeneous electron gas. The authors stress that this approach is not an attempt to replace QMC calculations, but rather to improve upon them by designing an interpolation for the self-energy that can smoothly connect various regions of the parameter space and provide a numerically stable algorithm for solving the impurity model.</summary>",0

The study of nonequilibrium phase transitions in complex systems is a growing area of interest, with applications in areas such as contact process, domain growth, catalysis, phase separation, and transport phenomena. While there is no general theory for these systems, recent progress has been made in understanding their stationary states using approximate analytical methods and simulations.
2. The paper focuses on the phase transitions observed in a modified version of the surface reaction model proposed by Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad, which describes some kinetic aspects of the oxidation of CO over a catalytic surface. The modified model incorporates a random distribution of inert sites on the catalytic surface.
3. The original ZGB model is an irreversible lattice model for surface reactions based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where reactants must be adsorbed before reacting. The model exhibits two phase transitions between active and poisoned states, depending on the partial pressures of the CO and O2 gases.

4. The paper introduces the standard realization, a discrete harmonic map from a crystal lattice into a Euclidean space, to characterize an equilibrium configuration of crystals.
5. The relationship between the Albanese metric, introduced in the Euclidean space and associated with the standard realization, and the central limit theorem for random walks on the crystal lattice is also discussed.
6. The exclusion process on the crystal lattice is considered, and the problem of the hydrodynamic limit is to capture the collective behavior of particles via the scaling limit.
7. A crystal lattice is defined as an infinite graph with a free action of a free abelian group with a finite quotient graph. A scaling limit of a crystal lattice is constructed by taking a quotient of the lattice by a finite index subgroup of the free abelian group.
8. The symmetric simple exclusion process and its perturbation, the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process, are dealt with in the paper. The latter case results in a heat equation with nonlinear drift terms on the torus as the limit of the process of empirical density.
9.

4. Indirect evidence of AGN feedback is seen in the relationships between SMBH mass and host galaxy properties, suggesting a strong coevolution of the two.
5. Determining accurate SFR estimates in AGN host galaxies is challenging due to AGN contamination in well-calibrated indicators such as Hα emission and UV luminosity.
6. The infrared (IR) regime is often used to estimate SFR, as dust re-emits stellar light from young stars in this range.
7. Dust plays a key role in the ISM, contributing little to overall mass but significantly to the radiative output, primarily in the IR regime.
8. Spectral energy distribution (SED) models and observations suggest that AGN-heated dust primarily emits in the mid-IR, while stellar dust re-radiation peaks in the far-IR.

The fundamental group of the complement of plane curves is a topological invariant that can be used to distinguish between connected components of the moduli space of smooth projective surfaces and to compute the fundamental groups of complements of hypersurfaces in higher dimensions.

This conjecture was recently proved by Eliyahu, Liberman, Schaps, and Teicher, who defined a conjugation-free geometric presentation for the fundamental group of some line arrangements. This definition has implications for the family of arrangements whose fundamental groups have conjugation-free geometric presentations and the families of nice and simple arrangements.

42,"• Organic molecular crystals are promising materials for fabricating nanoscale devices, with potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics.
• These devices typically consist of both organic and inorganic components, with the organic component forming the active part of the device and the inorganic component providing electrical contact to external circuitry.
• The interface between the organic and inorganic components plays a crucial role in determining the final device performance.
• A common way to calculate the addition and removal energies of a molecule on a substrate is to use a quasiparticle (qp) description, which ignores the effects of relaxation of molecular orbitals due to addition or removal of electrons.
• The adequacy of the qp description depends on the level of theory used to calculate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
• Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly used to calculate the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO, but it may not accurately describe the qp energies of molecules, especially when using local or semi-local approximations of the exchange and correlation functional.
• The formation of the image charge, which occurs when a molecule is adsorbed on a substrate, has a non-local nature and can affect the position of the HOMO and LUMO.
• The gw approximation, which is a many-body approach, can capture the energy levels renormalization due to the image charge effect, but it is computationally demanding and can only be applied to small systems.
• Constrained density functional theory (CDFT) can be used to evaluate the charge transfer energies of an organic molecule physisorbed on an inorganic substrate in a more resource-efficient manner.
• CDFT avoids the calculation of a qp spectrum and benefits from the fact that the total energy is usually an accurate quantity, even at the LDA level. It is also computationally no more demanding than a standard DFT calculation.",1

The results show that odd hydrogenation states of coronene cations predominantly populate the mass spectrum, and that the further hydrogenation of pah cations is associated with a barrier if the number of already attached hydrogen atoms is odd, and no barrier if this number is even. This suggests that pah cations can also enjoy highly hydrogenated states in the interstellar medium and act as catalysts for h@xmath2 formation.
2. * The experiment was performed using a setup designed to study molecular ions in a radiofrequency ion trap, and the data obtained from the experiment are a series of mass spectra of hydrogenated coronene cations as a function of h exposure time. The results show that the most important peaks measured in the mass spectrum shift from lower masses to higher masses with increasing h exposure time, and that the first hydrogenations of coronene cations should be comparable to the hydrogenation of neutral coronene. However, for higher degree of hydrogenation, the study shows that these barriers still exist, while calculations predict that these barriers vanish after a few hydrogenations.",0

The cosmological constant problem (CCP) is a major puzzle in particle physics, and consists of several pieces including the existence of various sources of vacuum energy density, large radiative corrections to vacuum energy density, and the discrepancy between the experimental value of the cosmological constant and the predicted value from theory.
2. The authors suggest that a dominant part of dark energy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy under the assumption that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large portion of the vacuum energy effectively. This idea is based on an effective description of various experimental results concerning the vacuum energy.
3. The authors explain that the vacuum energy density can receive large radiative corrections including a cutoff scale, and that the zero point energy density is calculated by using an effective potential at the one-loop level. They also discuss the possibility of a cancellation among various contributions from a higher energy physics based on a powerful symmetry such as supersymmetry.
4. The authors conclude that to uncover a clue of CCP and probe into the identity of dark energy density, it is necessary to study whether the vacuum energy exists in physical reality and whether it gravitates or the classical gravitational field feels the vacuum energy. They also suggest that the evolution of dark energy and the relationship between the classical gravitational field and the quantum one are important topics to pursue.",0

2. * Recent precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two-step transitions have renewed interest in testing theoretical methods like many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) in other states.
3. * Standard spectroscopic techniques rely on a high population of atoms in the ground state, but this is not the case in two-step transitions, leading to low signal-to-noise ratios and potential unavailability of detectors at desired frequencies.
4. * The paper presents two-color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studying atomic properties of higher excited states, which uses two counter-propagating lasers through a thermal vapor, with one modulated, to monitor absorption as a function of probe laser detuning.
5. * The technique overcomes the main inconveniences of direct absorption by producing sub-Doppler peaks and sidebands, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and eliminating the need for detectors at specific wavelengths.
6. * The method is demonstrated through two ladder systems in rubidium, with different applications of amplitude and frequency modulation, allowing for locking the probe laser to excited atomic resonances without electronic modulation side effects.
7. * The theoretical model uses a density matrix formalism for a three-level atom in a ladder configuration interacting with two lasers, one with sidebands, and is solved using a Floquet basis expansion of the density matrix.
8. * The three-level model reproduces resonance features observed in absorption experiments, and the method can be extended to other atomic levels and applications.
9. * The paper concludes with a summary of precise measurements using this method and emphasizes the importance of stringent control over experimental parameters for precision studies of energy separations.",0
50,"1. * The physics potential of forward proton tagging at the LHC has been a topic of interest, particularly for the central exclusive production (CEP) process where protons remain intact and are separated from the central system by a large rapidity gap. Observation of any particle in the CEP channel would provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers and allow for mass measurement regardless of decay products.
2. * Proposals have been made to install forward proton detectors at the LHC, such as the FP420 collaboration's plan to install detectors 420 meters from the interaction points, allowing for detection of central systems with masses in the approximate range of 70 GeV to 1 GeV. Other proposals aim to upgrade the capabilities of ATLAS and CMS to detect protons in the 220 m region.
3. * The paper focuses on the CEP of the Standard Model (SM) and supersymmetric (MSSM) Higgs boson, with a mass of 120 GeV. The dominant decay channel for this mass region is H → bb, which is difficult to observe in conventional Higgs searches due to the large QCD background. However, the CEP process suppresses the leading order background for this decay channel, making it observable at the LHC with appropriate proton tagging detectors.
4. * The acceptance of the forward detectors and their ability to correctly associate detected outgoing protons with a Higgs boson candidate event in the central detector are critical for this analysis. The proposed forward detectors aim to achieve a 10 ps accuracy in the time-of-flight measurement, allowing for a vertex measurement accurate to 2.1 mm. The central detector could also provide a third timing measurement for improved rejection of pile-up events.",0
51,"1. The zero-field Hall effect in chiral p-wave superconductors (SCs) has been studied recently due to the broken time reversal symmetry, which allows for a nonzero Hall conductivity. This can arise from the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs and spontaneous surface current, as well as impurity effects or multiband SC structure.
2. In this work, the authors address the zero-field Hall effect in a chiral p-wave SC originating from vortex dynamics near the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition. In 2D superfluid or SC films, quantized vortices are topological defects in the condensates, and their dynamics are key to understanding phase transition phenomena.
3. The KT transition is a phase transition observed in superfluid helium films, where vortex-antivortex pair unbinding occurs across a transition temperature. This is described by a static theory that relates the phase transition to the vortex-antivortex pair unbinding process, with a logarithmic vortex-antivortex interaction that is screened by smaller pairs and renormalized for temperature.
4. The authors combine this static theory with a dynamical description of vortex motion to give an analysis of the dynamical effect on the phase transition. This results in broadening of the transition observed in superfluid helium films and charged fermi systems such as high-temperature SCs.
5. The authors explore the physical consequences of this KT transition in a broken time reversal symmetry state, such as in superconducting Sr2RuO4 or a He-A phase thin film, where pairing of chiral p-wave type is expected. They consider a 2D p-wave pairing state with a 2-vector and derive the response functions for vortex-antivortex bound pair dynamics.
6. The authors investigate the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor, treating the bound pair and free vortex contribution separately. They also discuss the contribution of free vortex motion and the resulting total conductivity tensor. The paper is organized into sections that describe the generalization of AHNS vortex dynamics in the chiral p-wave context, the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity tensor, and a summary and remark. The appendix provides analytic",0
52,"1. The measurement of rotation curves (RCs) of disk galaxies is a useful tool to study the nature of dark matter (DM), including its distribution and content relative to baryonic components.
2. Dwarf galaxies are good candidates for this purpose as their kinematics are dominated by the DM component, even at small galactocentric radii, providing a reliable measurement of the dynamical contribution of DM to the RC and its density profile.
3. The NFW profile, which arises from pure N-body DM simulations, may not be accurate in cosmological DM halos due to the effect of baryonic infall and subsequent stellar disk formation, leading to shallower profiles.
4. Recent studies have shown that kinematic data of dwarf galaxies are better fitted by a DM halo with a constant density core than by one that is centrally peaked.
5. The Orion dwarf galaxy is an important test case for DM density profiles as its kinematics unambiguously point towards a cored profile, making it a critical system for investigating the nature of DM particles and the evolution of DM halos.
6. The Orion dwarf galaxy is also useful for testing the MOND formalism, which accounts for the evidence that RCs of spiral galaxies are inconsistent with the corresponding distribution of luminous matter without postulating the existence of a dark halo made of massive collisionless elementary particles.
7. The distance to the Orion dwarf galaxy remains a significant source of uncertainty, with a potential distance ambiguity much larger than the formal errors estimated using the brightest stars method.
8. The properties of the Orion dwarf galaxy make it an attractive candidate for determining the underlying gravitational potential of the galaxy, and the paper is organized to present the stellar surface photometry, surface density and kinematics data, and to model the RC in the stellar disk using a cored/cusped halo framework.",0
53,"• The trihydrogen dication (three protons and one electron) has been studied extensively, but its stability remains unclear.
• Conroy investigated the potential energy surfaces of the electronic ground state and the lowest excited states, concluding that the trihydrogen dication is not stable.
• Berkowitz and Stocker searched for the ion through charge stripping experiments and found no evidence of a stable trihydrogen dication.
• Shoucri and Darling, and Hernndes and Carb revisited the question theoretically, but did not find a bound state.
• Ackermann et al. used the finite element method and found critical values of charges for the existence of stable or metastable equilateral triangular configurations.
• The text aims to study the stability of a Coulomb system of one electron and three protons in an equilateral triangle configuration.
• Two methods are used to explore the system: a specialized variational method with physically relevant trial functions, and a standard variational method using standard Gaussian trial functions.
• A trial function is taken as a linear superposition of six basis functions, each chosen to describe different physical characteristics of the system.
• Calculations were performed using the Hartree-Fock code implemented in the Molpro suite of programs with the correlation consistent cc-pv6z and modified mcc-pv7z basis sets.
• The results show that the total energy does not indicate a minimum or slight non-adiabatic irregularities for finite interproton distance, suggesting that the molecular ion does not exist in equilateral triangular configuration in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.",1

- Recent investigations of the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have revealed a complex relationship between the properties of galaxies (such as color, luminosity, surface brightness, and concentration) and their environments.
* Galaxy clustering is a function of both star formation history and luminosity. For low luminosity galaxies, clustering is a strong function of color, while for luminous galaxies, clustering is a strong function of luminosity.
* The relationship between galaxy clustering and surface brightness and concentration is independent of these properties at fixed color and luminosity.
* Color and luminosity measures of star formation history appear to have a more fundamental relationship with environment than do surface brightness and concentration measures.
* Some studies have explored the scale dependence of these relationships, but it is important to examine whether the density on large scales is related to galaxy properties independent of the relationships with density on small scales.
* The ""halo model"" description of galaxy formation and semi-analytic models that depend only on the properties of the host halo assume that only the masses of the host halos of galaxies strongly affect their properties.
* Recent studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether galaxy properties are related to the large scale density field independent of the relationships with density on small scales.
* The SDSS is a survey that is taking CCD imaging of the northern galactic sky and selecting targets for spectroscopy, most of them galaxies. The data processing is done automatically by software that performs astrometry, source identification, deblending and photometry, photometricity determination, calibration, spectroscopic target selection, spectroscopic fiber placement, and spectroscopic data reduction.",0
55,"1. Transverse spin fluctuations are important low-energy excitations in magnetic systems with continuous spin-rotational symmetry, and play a crucial role in various macroscopic properties such as long-range order, order parameter, Néel temperature, and spin correlations.
2. In the antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model, transverse spin fluctuations significantly reduce the zero-temperature AF order parameter in two dimensions and the Néel temperature in three dimensions.
3. Recent interest has been given to spin fluctuations due to defects, disorder, and vacancies in quantum antiferromagnets. In the random-t model, where the exchange interaction is set to zero on a fraction of sites, the lattice-averaged AF order parameter is enhanced for small fractions due to suppression of quantum spin fluctuations.
4. A new method has been developed to evaluate transverse spin correlations and quantum spin-fluctuation corrections about the Hartree-Fock (HF) level broken-symmetry state, using magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation (RPA).
5. This method is applicable in the whole range of interaction strength and has been illustrated with three applications involving the AF ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model: (i) the pure model in different dimensions, (ii) spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit, and (iii) low-concentration impurities.
6. The RPA approach has been shown to properly interpolate between weak and strong coupling limits for the spin-wave velocity and yield identical results as the spin-wave theory approach in the strong coupling limit for the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.
7. A renormalized RPA approach has been devised to obtain the magnetic phase diagram for the three-dimensional Hubbard model, and the behavior of the Néel temperature with interaction strength and doping concentration has been shown to properly interpolate between weak and strong coupling limits.
8. The quantum spin-fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization has been obtained for the half-filled Hubbard model in the whole interaction strength range, and results in two and three dimensions are shown to interpolate properly between both the weak and strong correlation limits.
9. The method has been extended to study the defect-induced enhancement/suppression in transverse spin fluctuations for spin vac",0

- The text discusses the study of nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum field theory, with a focus on inflationary cosmology. The study of multi-field models of inflation, where the inflaton is coupled to another dynamical field during inflation, is of particular interest due to the variety of features they can lead to. The subsequent phase of energy transfer between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom is also discussed.
- The text discusses the renormalization of time evolution equations in single field models, and proposes a method for renormalizing time dependent equations in multi-field models using dimensional regularization. The method is used in the context of a closed time path formalism, where the in-vacuum plays a predominant role and quantities are tracked by their in-in expectation values.
- The text also discusses the physical applications of the problem, including the two-field case which is often encountered in inflationary models. The text introduces a time-dependent mixing angle to better understand how the system evolves in time and to provide a measure of how much the fields mix at each moment. The text also discusses some relevant cosmological multi-field models for inflation, including a simple two-field model used for studying the phase of parametric amplification and a supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model.",0
57,"1. * The existence of dark matter (DM) has been established and its thermal relic abundance has been determined by the WMAP experiment. A promising candidate for DM is the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP).
2. * In models beyond the Standard Model (SM), it is desired to have a viable DM candidate. The WIMP DM candidate can be accommodated economically by introducing only an inert scalar field.
3. * The imposed Z2 parity ensures the stability of the DM candidate. Phenomenology in such models has been studied in refs.
4. * Neutrino oscillation measurements have confirmed that neutrinos have nonzero but tiny masses as compared to the electroweak scale. The different flavor structure of neutrinos from that of quarks and leptons may indicate that neutrino masses are of Majorana type.
5. * Many models have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses, with the seesaw mechanism and the Higgs triplet model (HTM) being the simplest ways. However, these scenarios do not contain a DM candidate.
6. * In models where tiny neutrino masses are generated by higher orders of perturbation, the DM candidate can be naturally contained. In models in refs., the Yukawa couplings of neutrinos with the SM Higgs boson are forbidden at the tree level by imposing a Z2 parity.
7. * The same Z2 parity also guarantees the stability of the lightest Z2-odd particle in the model, which can be the candidate of the DM as long as it is electrically neutral.
8. * In this paper, the authors consider an extension of the HTM in which a Z2 parity is generated at the one-loop level and the DM candidate appears.",0
58,"1. Quantum communication technologies, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), promise to fundamentally change the way we communicate by allowing intrinsically secure communication.
2. However, these new technologies require a new telecommunications infrastructure that can properly accommodate the quantum properties they rely on.
3. A quantum network will contain many novel components, such as quantum memories, quantum repeaters, or quantum channels, which must each operate in a strictly quantum way.
4. To ensure a device is operating in a sufficiently quantum way, it is important to enforce a minimal quantum requirement, such as not acting as a ""measure and prepare"" channel.
5. The quantum behavior of devices can be quantified using measures such as entanglement measures or the secret key rate in QKD.
6. A strong quantum channel is one that preserves all or nearly all of the quantum correlations, which can be studied by examining the output of a bipartite state that has been sent through the channel.
7. The quantum throughput can be used to characterize the suitability of devices for quantum communication tasks.
8. A testing procedure for devices in a quantum communications network should be as experimentally practical as possible, with a finite number of test states and a limited set of measurements sufficient to understand the quantum throughput.

The results of this quantification procedure for a wide class of optical channels are provided, and the strength of the method is examined.",0
59,"1. The study of dipole moments of elementary particles, such as the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron, has provided valuable information in subatomic physics, including the discovery of spin, radiative corrections, and the renormalizable theory of QED. The magnetic moment of a charged particle with spin is given by the equation @xmath5 in the particle data tables, where @xmath4 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath5 is the anomaly.
2. The electron anomaly is now measured to a precision of about four parts in a billion, and the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million. The relative contributions of heavier particles to the anomalous magnetic moment scale as @xmath17, so the muon has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections of about 40,000 over the electron. A significant difference between the experimental value and the standard model prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment would signify the presence of new physics.
3. The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment has been the topic of much theoretical investigation and is likely to provide the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard model value. Measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment have placed serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model, and interest in the experimental and theoretical value of the anomalous magnetic moment has grown substantially with the development of supersymmetric theories as a favored scheme of physics beyond the standard model.
4. The search for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the muon is of great importance as it would signify physics beyond the standard model. A new experiment to search for a permanent EDM of the muon with a design sensitivity of @xmath62 @xmath63-cm is being planned for J-PARC. The two bands in fig . [ fg : phicp ] show the one and two standard-deviation ranges if the anomalous magnetic moment differs from the standard model value by @xmath68. The figure of merit for statistics in the EDM experiment is the number of muons times the polarization, and in order to reach @xmath82 cm, the muon EDM experiment would need a flux only available at a future facility.",0
60,"1. The paper presents a new design for an optomechanical system that consists of a microdisk resonator coupled to a waveguide, which enables the study of reactive effects in optomechanical coupling.
2. The reactive coupling originates from the dependence of the microdisk resonator's extrinsic losses on mechanical motion and leads to phase-dependent gradient forces.
3. The design is more effective in achieving cooling of the system to its ground state, but the paper explores other possibilities for investigating the effects of strong reactive coupling without cooling.
4. The authors examine the nonlinear response of the microdisk resonator to pump-probe fields, reporting reactive-coupling-induced normal mode splitting.
5. Normal mode splitting is observed in output fields in the presence of reactive coupling, while there is no normal mode splitting in output fields in its absence.
6. The system consists of a microdisk cavity coupled to a freestanding waveguide, with a strong pump field and a weak stokes field entering through the waveguide.
7. The waveguide moves along the x-direction under the action of the optical force exerted by the photons from the cavity, and the displacement of the waveguide changes the resonant frequency of the cavity field and the cavity decay rate.
8. The paper studies the physical effects by scanning the stokes laser and finds that the expectation values of the system oscillate at three frequencies (ω0, ω1, and 2ω39).
9. The authors observe normal mode splitting of output fields due to reactive coupling between the waveguide and the cavity, and the separation of the peaks increases for larger pump powers. Additionally, the reactive coupling can also cause four-wave mixing, which creates an anti-stokes component generated by the optomechanical system.",0
61,"1. * The text discusses the dynamics of a quantum Ising chain in the context of transport of transverse magnetization. A new protocol is introduced to prepare an initial configuration with odd-occupation basis states in fermionic momentum space, which results in inhomogeneity in transverse magnetization even in the presence of a homogeneous external transverse field.
2. * The dynamics of the system are characterized by oscillatory behavior with an envelope that decays algebraically in the large time limit. The envelope exhibits two timescales, with one responsible for tiny undulations and the other for larger oscillations with algebraic decay.
3. * The frequency of oscillation varies monotonically with the external field in the ferromagnetic phase and becomes independent of the field in the paramagnetic region, coinciding with the occurrence of an order-disorder quantum phase transition.
4. * The persistence of inhomogeneity of magnetization and the non-analytic behavior of a quantity related to the long-time behavior suggest that two new quantities bear the signature of criticality, while the exponent of decay remains unaltered in different phases. The inhomogeneity in transverse magnetization cannot be removed by the external field, which is counterintuitive to prevailing ideas. The text raises questions about the behavior of non-local observables and the dynamics of non-integrable systems starting from such inhomogeneity.",0
62,"1. * Studying QCD at finite baryon density is important for understanding the structure of compact stars and the conditions near the core of collapsing stars. The behavior of QCD at finite baryon density and low temperature is central to this understanding.
2. * Sufficiently cold and dense baryonic matter is known to be in the color superconducting phase. This phase may exist in the central region of compact stars, but the constraint of charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium can lead to a mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks, which can eventually destroy the Cooper pairing.
3. * The chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase of color superconductivity remains an unsolved puzzle. It is unclear why the gluons can feel the instability by requiring electrical neutrality on the system.
4. * The g2sc phase exhibits a paramagnetic response to an external baryon current, which indicates that a vector current can be spontaneously generated in the system. This generated vector current behaves as a vector potential, which modifies the quark self-energy with a spatial vector condensate, and breaks the rotational symmetry of the system.",0
63," * The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory is a widely accepted theory for the melting phase transition of two-dimensional systems, which involves two separate, continuous transitions as a solid transforms into a liquid in quasi-equilibrium steps. These transitions are mediated by the unbinding of dislocation pairs into individual dislocations and dislocations into point defects.
* The KTHNY theory is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids the existence of exact long-range positional order in 2D for a wide range of pair potentials at finite temperatures. However, it assumes a dilute, unstructured distribution of lattice defects, which is in contradiction with observations of alignment and accumulation of dislocations into small angle domain walls.
* The validity of the KTHNY theory has been examined for systems with different pair interactions, including hard-sphere (disk), Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, dipole-dipole, and Debye-Hückel (screened Coulomb or Yukawa) inter-particle interactions. These studies have revealed a range of behaviors, including first-order phase transitions, second-order (or single-step continuous) transitions, and KTHNY-like transitions.
* The observation of the hexatic phase is strongly linked with the thermodynamic equilibration of the systems, and the necessary equilibration time strongly depends on the measured quantity of interest. Local or single particle properties can equilibrate very rapidly, while long-range or collective relaxations usually take significantly longer. Monitoring the velocity distribution function alone to verify the equilibration of the system is insufficient.",1
64,"1. The Kepler mission has discovered over 4100 planetary candidates, leading to a better understanding of planet occurrence rates around various types of stars. Small planets, particularly those with sizes between Earth and Neptune, are common.
2. Accurate planetary radii are crucial for understanding the distribution of planetary structures, including the relative occurrence rates of ""rocky"" and ""non-rocky"" planets and the relationship between radius, mass, and bulk density. However, only about half of the Kepler candidate stars have been observed due to their brightness distribution.
3. The presence of stellar companions can change observed transit depths and planetary radii, introducing systematic uncertainties into the planetary radii and occurrence rate distributions. A non-negligible fraction of Kepler host stars may be multiple stars, which can affect planetary radius estimates.
4. The transit depth is the observable, and the observed depth depends on the brightness ratio of the transited star to the total brightness of the system and the stellar radius being transited. The Kepler planetary candidate parameters are estimated assuming a single star, which may lead to incorrect planet radius reports in multiple star systems.
5. To explore the possible effects of undetected stellar companions on derived planetary parameters, possible bound stellar companions to each Kepler candidate host star are assessed using the Dartmouth isochrones. Possible gravitationally bound companions are assumed to lie along the same isochrone as the primary star.
6. The correction factor for planetary radii underestimation varies depending on the particular system and which star the planet may orbit. The mean correction factor for any one multiplicity scenario must be calculated by taking into account the probability the star may be a multiple star, the distribution of mass ratios, the probability that the planet orbits any one star, and whether or not the star has been vetted for stellar companions.",0
65,"1. The range of HI column densities in nearby galaxies' neutral gas disks is similar to that of damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) or DLAs with associated HI.
2. Mapping the HI gas of DLA absorbing systems in 21-cm emission is impossible with present technology due to the weak line caused by the hyperfine splitting's small transition probability.
3. The identification of DLAs as absorbers in background QSO spectra is not distance-dependent, but the lowest redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers cannot be observed from the ground due to the Earth's opaque atmosphere in the UV wavelength range.
4. There are not many DLAs known whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present-day radio telescopes due to the universe's expansion causing the redshift number density of DLAs to decrease rapidly toward lower redshifts.
5. Observers often resort to optical wavelengths to study DLAs, but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been mostly unsuccessful. A few positive identifications exist, mostly from HST imaging.
6. There are now ~10 DLAs known at low redshift, with galaxies spanning a wide range of properties, from inconspicuous LSB dwarfs to giant spirals and even early-type galaxies.
7. A statistical study can be done to see if the properties of DLAs and DLA galaxies agree with knowledge of HI in the local universe, using blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe with single-dish radio telescopes.

 * Only a modest percentage of the gas in a giant molecular cloud is turned into stars during the collapse and fragmentation of a star cluster.
 * A star cluster will be made up of a combination of gas and stars in its initial phases, but gas is removed by stellar winds and supernova explosions, causing a rapid change in gravitational potential energy and resulting in a cluster devoid of gas.
 * Many studies have attempted to constrain the initial stellar mass function (IMF) in clusters by studying the internal dynamics of young clusters, but have found discrepant results.

2. * The text also discusses the use of the dual-fermion representation for spin baths, which allows for the simulation of non-Gaussian spin environments using Gaussian processes. This is useful for simulating spin baths in solid-state quantum technologies, where phonon modes are frozen and other interactions become dominant.

70," * Dyadic data is common in psychosocial and behavioral studies, with many social phenomena being interpersonal in nature. This means that related observations refer to both persons involved in the dyadic relationship, with members often influencing each other's cognitions, emotions, and behaviors.
* Longitudinal dyadic data, or data collected over time, can be complicated by two types of correlations: within-dyad correlation and within-subject correlation. When analyzing such data, it is important to account for both types of correlations simultaneously to ensure valid results. Additionally, longitudinal dyadic data are prone to the missing data problem caused by dropout, which can lead to biased estimates if not properly addressed.
* There is a rich body of literature on statistical modeling of nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal studies, with two broad classes of likelihood-based nonignorable models: selection models and pattern mixture models. However, the nonignorable dropout problem has not been addressed in the context of longitudinal dyadic data, which brings new challenges due to the interdependence structure within dyads.
* The proposed approach to address this issue is a fully Bayesian selection model that accounts for the interdependence between patients and their spouses by modeling each subject's longitudinal measurement process using a transition model with both patient and spouse characteristics as covariates. The model also accounts for within-dyad correlation by introducing dyad-specific random effects and accommodates nonignorable dropouts by directly modeling the relationship between the dropout process and missing outcomes using a discrete time survival model.
* The proposed approach is applied to a motivating data set from a longitudinal dyadic breast cancer study and is shown to outperform complete-case and available-case analyses in simulation studies.

In 1948, H.B.G. Casimir predicted that two electrically neutral metallic parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other due to a force inversely proportional to the fourth power of separation. This force arises because the plates act as a cavity where only the electromagnetic modes that have nodes on both the walls can exist, and the zero-point energy per unit area is smaller when the plates are kept at close distance compared to when they are at infinite separation.
2. E.M. Lifshitz, I.E. Dzyaloshinskii, and L.P. Pitaevskii generalized Casimir's theory to isotropic dielectrics. They derived an analytical formula that relates the Helmholtz free energy associated with the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field to the dielectric functions of the interacting materials and of the medium in which they are immersed. At very short distances (typically smaller than a few nanometers), Lifshitz's theory provides a complete description of the non-retarded van der Waals force. At larger separations, retardation effects give rise to a long-range interaction that in the case of two ideal metals in vacuum reduces to Casimir's result. Lifshitz's equation also shows that two plates made out of the same material always attract, regardless of the choice of the intervening medium. For slabs of different materials, the sign of the force depends on the dielectric properties of the medium in which they are immersed. While the force is always attractive in vacuum, there are situations for which a properly chosen liquid will cause the two plates to repel each other.
3. The Casimir-Lifshitz force between isotropic dielectrics has received considerable attention in the modern literature and has been verified in several high precision experiments. Less precise measurements in liquids have been reported, and experimental evidence for repulsive van der Waals forces between dielectric surfaces in different fluids has also been reported. The Casimir-Lifshitz force might be a potentially relevant issue for the development of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems.

* Debris disk systems, like the one surrounding star HD32297, represent an intermediate stage of stellar system evolution, transitioning between the primordial protoplanetary disk and a mature system clear of primordial material.
* The HD32297 debris disk has an edge-on orientation, making it ideal for gas phase absorption measurements. Observations using the Hubble Space Telescope and the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory revealed two absorption components toward HD32297.
* The stronger absorption component is likely caused by circumstellar material, while the weaker one is due to interstellar absorption from the shell that defines the boundary of the Local Bubble. Some variation in local bubble absorption is detected toward 18 Ori.
* Radial velocities of HD32297, BD+07 777s, and BD+07 778 differ significantly, indicating they are likely not physically associated. Some indication of temporal variability is detected over several epochs of observations, but instrumental resolution variations and masking by the strong ISM absorption make a definitive detection of circumstellar variability difficult.
* The measured circumstellar feature toward HD32297 is the strongest such absorption measured toward any nearby main sequence debris disk, 45 times greater than the column density of the prototypical edge-on debris disk, Beta Pictoris.

It focuses on the case of a CFT deformed by a marginal or irrelevant operator, and shows how to relate the 3-point correlation function to the anomalous dimension matrix obtained from deforming the CFT. The authors also discuss the case of a CFT with a line of fixed points, such as N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, and show how to compute the couplings in the 3-point function of the Lagrangian with any two operators of the theory using integrability.
2. The text also discusses the computation of the string partition function using different approaches to treat the heavy and light string fields. It shows how to write the gauge theory generating functional for diagrams with insertions of the operator dual to the heavy string field and the operator dual to the supergravity fields, and how to approximate the generating functional at strong coupling using the string polyakov action.

77,"1. The text discusses a relativistic embedding scheme for solving the Dirac equation in a limited region of a larger system, where the influence of the rest of the system is accounted for by an energy-dependent non-local potential. This method has been used in various applications, such as surface electronic structure problems, studies of image states, surface states, static and dynamic screening, atomic adsorption and scattering at surfaces, studies of surface optical response, field emission, and transport problems.
2. The embedding scheme is derived using a trial function in which continuity in the small component across the surface separating the two regions is imposed variationally. The wave function is expanded in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors, and the problem of variational collapse is avoided by using a basis satisfying kinetic balance. The method is shown to be stable and converge to the exact eigenvalues for a confined hydrogen atom.
3. The text also discusses the use of a trial function that is discontinuous in the small component, which gives rise to a discontinuous probability density. This is unacceptable for certain applications, but the solutions continue to be valid approximations at least in terms of providing estimates of the energies of the solutions of the Dirac equation. The method places no greater emphasis on a discontinuity in the small amplitude at the surface than on an incorrect (but continuous) amplitude elsewhere within the embedded region. The embedding scheme has been widely used in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, and has been used to determine currents and transport properties in various applications.",0

2. Semiclassical methods have been used to treat wave-dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength, providing approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system.
3. The corresponding classical system for dielectric cavities is an open dielectric billiard, where rays travel freely and are partially reflected and refracted when impinging the boundary.
4. A trace formula was recently developed for two-dimensional (2D) dielectric resonators, which relates the density of states of a quantum or wave-dynamical system to the periodic orbits (POs) of the corresponding classical system.

The coalescence of double neutron stars (DNS) is predicted to radiate about 10^erg in the last seconds of their inspiral trajectory, at frequencies up to 1.4-1.6 kHz.
2. The rate at which DNS coalescences occur in the local universe is another crucial factor in determining their potential as GW sources. A previous investigation estimated a detection rate of one event every 125 and 148 years by initial LIGO and Virgo, respectively, and up to 6 detections per year in their advanced configurations.

81,"1. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of particles at shock fronts is a widely studied phenomenon, with much understood but some issues still debated, particularly the backreaction of accelerated particles on the shock.
2. The backreaction occurs when the acceleration process becomes efficient enough to generate pressures comparable to the incoming gas kinetic pressure, changing the particle spectrum and shock structure.
3. Three approaches exist to account for backreaction: numerical simulations, fluid approach treating cosmic rays as a relativistic second fluid, and analytical methods.
4. A perturbative analytical approach has been proposed, but it only provides answers for weakly modified shocks.
5. Numerical simulations have shown that even a small fraction of particles injected from the thermal gas can significantly affect the kinetic energy of the unshocked fluid, making the test particle approach unsuitable.
6. The most visible effects of backreaction appear in the spectrum of accelerated particles, which shows a peculiar flattening at the highest energies.
7. While several calculations exist for nonlinear effects in shock acceleration of quasi-monochromatic particles, there is no description of how these effects appear when the shock propagates in a medium with preaccelerated particles.
8. The backreaction can severely affect the process of re-energization of preaccelerated particles, and an analytical treatment of shock acceleration in the presence of seed nonthermal particles, including their nonlinear backreaction, has been reported.",0
82," * Type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, and large scale structure observations suggest that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase.
 * This result is generally attributed to the existence of a dark energy (DE) sector with negative pressure, which eventually dominates over cold dark matter (CDM) and drives the accelerating expansion.
 * The simplest candidate for DE is the cosmological constant, but it is plagued by the cosmological constant problem and may also suffer from the age problem.
 * Over the past decade, several DE models have been proposed, including quintessence, phantom, k-essence, tachyon, quintom, chaplygin gas, generalized chaplygin gas, holographic DE, new agegraphic DE, and Ricci DE.
 * There are also models that induce an effective DE from modifications of the gravitational sector itself, such as f(T) gravity, gravity with higher curvature invariants, scalar-tensor gravity, vector-tensor gravity, and gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes.
 * One possibility to explain the accelerated phase of the universe is to consider a theory of gravity based on the Weitzenböck connection, which describes the gravitational field by the torsion instead of the curvature tensor.
 * Teleparallel gravity, based on the Weitzenböck connection, is equivalent to general relativity at the level of equations but has some attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects.
 * One can start from teleparallel gravity and construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion, such as f(T) gravity, which may represent an alternative to inflationary models and effective DE models.
 * The main advantage of f(T) gravity is that the field equations are 2nd-order ones, which makes these theories simpler compared to the dynamical equations of other extended theories of gravity.
 * The paper explores the implications of f(T) gravity to the formation of light elements in the early universe, i.e., to the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and aims to constrain f(T) gravity by BBN observational data.",0

2. * The protocol is based on the assumption that all nodes have full knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of both links. In each time slot, each node is able to individually decide which transmission mode is selected and adapt its transmission strategy accordingly. The protocol is derived using the conditions for sum rate maximization and the average total transmit power constraint. The optimal transmit powers of the nodes are given by the optimal solution of an optimization problem, which is solved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions.",0

2. This ""standard ruler"" scale should be measurable in large galaxy redshift surveys at low redshifts, providing a way to constrain the matter and energy content of the universe.
3. However, if CMB measurements are misled by new physics, such as a new undetected relativistic particle, low-redshift applications could be biased.
4. The interpretation of low-redshift acoustic oscillations is robust if the CMB accurately measures the baryon-to-photon ratio and the epoch of matter-radiation equality.
5. The actual densities of matter and radiation are not important; only their ratio matters for the calculation.
6. If the physical matter density is misinterpreted from the CMB due to undetected relativistic components, dark energy inferences from combined CMB and low-redshift survey data sets remain unchanged.
7. The sound horizon method depends on measuring the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination.
8. The sound horizon integral depends on the Hubble parameter and the sound speed in the baryon-photon plasma.
9. The sound horizon is primarily accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination and depends on the baryon-to-photon ratio and the redshift of equality.

3. It is hoped that new experimental results can help determine neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles, which may provide insight into the neutrino mass matrix and a more fundamental theory beyond the Standard Model.
4. A plausible ansatz for the 3-generation neutrino mass matrix is proposed and its consequences are investigated.
5. In the SO(10) grand unified model, the proposed ansatz can be derived with certain assumptions and corresponds to the well-known approximate signature of grand unification.
6. The proposed ansatz can be combined with experimental information to estimate neutrino masses and the ""texture"" of the neutrino mass matrix.
7. In the SO(10) grand unification model, each generation contains one light massive two-component neutrino and a very heavy one that is ""integrated out"" according to the ""seesaw mechanism.""
8. The effective neutrino mass matrix takes the form of the sum of the mass matrices of the light neutrinos, heavy neutrinos, and heavy-light mixing.

87,"1. The Levi-Civita (LC) spacetime, which describes the gravitational field of an infinite line mass, remains a challenge to interpret despite many works dedicated to its discussion.
2. The LC spacetime has two essential constants: one related to the topology of spacetime (deficit angle) and another that presents serious obstacles to interpretation.
3. The spacetime described by LC is flat when the second constant is zero, and it describes the spacetime generated by an infinite line mass when the second constant is small.
4. The absence of circular test particle orbits for certain values of the second constant and the fact that most known material sources for LC require a specific range of values for the second constant led to the interpretation that LC describes the field of a cylinder only if the second constant ranges within a specific interval.
5. However, interior solutions matching to LC exist with circular test particle orbits, and the absence of circular test particle orbits may be due to the fact that the centrifugal force required to balance the gravitational attraction implies velocities of the test particle larger than the speed of light.
6. The Kretschmann scalar decreases as the second constant increases, suggesting that the gravitational field becomes weaker. However, the acceleration of the test particle increases with the second constant, indicating that it represents the intensity of the field more suitably.
7. Based on these arguments and the study of a specific interior solution matched to LC, Bonnor proposes to interpret LC as the spacetime generated by a cylinder whose radius increases with the second constant and tends to infinity as the second constant approaches its maximum value.
8. The interpretation of the LC spacetime as the field produced by an infinite plane with positive or negative mass density leads to the strange fact that the negative mass plane curves the spacetime, whereas the positive mass plane does not, which is difficult to understand intuitively.",0

There are several unresolved aspects of collisions, including the role of collision centrality, the nature and systematics of the underlying event (UE), the systematics of minimum-bias dijet (minijet) production, and the possible existence and phenomenology of a nonjet azimuth quadrupole component in 2D angular correlations.
3. A more detailed discussion of these issues is presented in the document, and a new study establishes a more complete mathematical model for phenomenology based on the pT dependence of single-particle (SP) spectra and -integral densities and -integral 2D angular correlations.
4. The study confronts several issues, including the connection between pT and centrality, the relevance of centrality as a concept, and the possibility of an equivalent phenomenon in collisions.
5. The phenomenological model should offer a conceptual context with two manifestations: as a mathematical framework to represent data systematics efficiently and as a theoretical framework to provide physical interpretation of model elements via comparisons between data structures and QCD theory.

91,"1. Left-handed metamaterials (LHMs) are a new type of artificial material that exhibit negative refractive indices for certain wavelengths, with various applications in modern optics and microelectronics. They can resolve images beyond the diffraction limit, act as an electromagnetic cloak, enhance quantum interference, and yield slow light propagation. Additionally, LHMs can suppress Anderson localization in disordered systems, leading to an unusual behavior of the localization length at long wavelengths. A sixth power dependence of the localization length with wavelength has been observed under refractive-index disorder, instead of the well-known quadratic asymptotic behavior.
2. The text discusses the numerical calculation of the localization length of light for a one-dimensional arrangement of layers with alternating refractive indices and thicknesses. Disorder is introduced by changing the position of the layer boundaries while maintaining the same refractive indices. Two structures are analyzed: homogeneous stacks (h) composed entirely of traditional right-handed materials (RHMs) with positive refractive indices, and mixed stacks (m) with alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials. An analytical expression for the localization length is derived for both h and m stacks using a perturbative theory up to second order in the disorder.
3. The localization length is modulated by the corresponding bands in weakly disordered systems, and this modulation decreases as the disorder increases. For low-disordered m stacks and wavelengths much greater than the grating period, the localization length depends linearly on the wavelength with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the reflection amplitude between alternating layers.
4. The paper also discusses the behavior of the localization length in the allowed bands and gaps of homogeneous stacks, as well as the influence of disorder on the localization length in the allowed bands and gaps of mixed stacks. The results are consistent with other published works on this topic.",0

 * Dark matter is crucial for explaining the difference between the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters (derived from the motion of galaxies) and the luminous mass (which includes galaxies and hot intergalactic gas).
 * Dark matter also plays a significant role in the formation of large structures by pulling in ordinary matter through gravitational collapse.
 * Dark matter must have been non-relativistic at the time of galaxy formation and is therefore referred to as cold dark matter (CDM).

93,"1. Long chain macromolecules, or polymers, have been widely studied due to their ubiquity in nature. While the physical properties of homopolymers are well understood, less is known about heteropolymers of biological significance.
2. From a biologist's perspective, the specific properties of a particular molecule are of interest, as genetic information is coded by specific sequences of nucleic acids that are translated into chains of amino acids forming a protein.
3. The energy of a protein is determined by various interactions between its constituent amino acids, including van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, and Coulomb interactions. These interactions determine the protein's final shape and activity.
4. Physicists, on the other hand, often sacrifice specificity in favor of more general information, using statistical descriptions of ensembles of molecules with a variety of interactions. These simple models of heteropolymers are also of interest as examples of disordered systems with connections to spin glasses.
5. Recent experimental studies have focused on solutions and gels of polymers with randomly charged groups. Statistical approaches only provide general descriptions of such heteropolymers, so researchers focus on simple models that include the essential ingredients.
6. The overall size and shape of a polymer with charged groups are most likely controlled by Coulomb interactions, which are the strongest and have the longest range. Researchers are particularly interested in the typical properties of a model polyampholyte (PA), a flexible chain in which each monomer has a fixed charge selected from a well-defined ensemble of quenches.
7. The long range nature of the Coulomb interactions, combined with the randomness of the charge sequence, produces effects quite distinct from systems with short range interactions. Researchers use numerical studies to explore the phase diagrams of quenched PAs in different dimensions, and find that the behavior of PAs is similar to that of random chains with short range interactions in some dimensions, while in other dimensions, the spatial conformations of a PA strongly depend on its excess charge. Additionally, there is a critical charge such that PAs with certain charges cannot form a compact state.",0

2. The density of the illuminated material is not constant along the vertical direction, as previously assumed. More recent studies have considered the effects of varying gas density, thermal instability, and different phases of gas with varying temperatures and densities.
3. The thomson depth of the hot coronal layer can greatly influence the x-ray reprocessing produced by the deeper, cooler disk. However, the calculation of the vertical structure can be challenging due to the coupling of hydrostatic balance, radiative transfer, and heat conduction.
4. The paper calculates the temperature structure in the layers above the accretion disk and the resulting emission lines and reflection due to resonance line scattering. The authors consider the effects of thermal conduction, transition layers, and stable phases on the resulting spectrum.
5. The paper also discusses the detectability of the recombination emission and reflection lines, which depends on the shape of the illuminating continuum and the presence of an intermediate stable layer. The authors find that the equivalent widths of the emission lines are less than 1.0 eV, with the strongest lines being the hydrogen-like and helium-like lines of oxygen and iron. However, these values conflict with those derived by previous studies, which may have considered thicker intermediate stable layers and neglected appropriate locations for the transition regions.",0

The text discusses the study of the transverse distribution function of a three-dimensional wormlike chain with a fixed orientation and position of the second end using the exact solution for the Green's function of the wormlike chain. The study finds that the distribution function for intermediate chain lengths possesses a bimodal shape with maxima at a finite value of the transverse displacement, consistent with recent studies for the two-dimensional chain. However, the transverse one-dimensional distribution function of the 3d chain shows only a tiny peak at a certain value, which disappears for larger chain lengths. The text also presents results of analytical considerations for short and large polymers and finds them to be in complete agreement with classical works.
2. The computation of the three-dimensional distribution function of a free polymer is found to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. The study also discusses the issues of accuracy of the calculations, which depends on the size of the matrices and the maximal value at which the summation over the quantum number is stopped. The text also discusses the origin of the bimodal behavior of the projected distribution function of the free end of the wormlike chain.",0
97,"1. A closed graph is a simple graph with a closed labeling, which is a bijection from the vertex set to the set {1, ..., n} such that for any distinct edges with either uv or vu as a substring, the labels of u and v differ by at least 2.
2. Closed graphs are chordal and claw-free, and they have a property called narrow, which means that for every vertex and every longest shortest path, either the vertex is adjacent to the path or it is adjacent to a vertex that is distance at most one from the path.
3. The paper proves that a connected graph is closed if and only if it is chordal, claw-free, and narrow.
4. The paper also introduces an algorithm for labeling connected graphs and uses it to prove the main theorem.
5. Closed graphs have applications in the study of binomial edge ideals, which are ideals in a polynomial ring generated by the binomials obtained from the edges of a labeled graph. The binomials form a Gröbner basis of the ideal for a lex order with a certain term ordering if and only if the labeling is closed.",0

99,"1. * Cold atoms in optical lattices is an application of quantum gases and laser theory from atomic physics and quantum optics. Optical lattices are artificial crystals of light created by the interference of laser beams. Atoms can be cooled and trapped in these optical lattices, which can then be used to investigate quantum behavior and phenomena in condensed matter physics.
2. * The superfluid to mott insulator (SF-MI) transition is an important phenomenon in condensed matter physics that has been observed in cold atoms in optical lattices. This transition has been made possible by the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a bosonic system. BEC is a physical state that occurs when the temperature goes down and almost all the particles in a bosonic system congregate in the ground state.
3. * The two-mode approximation is a theoretical framework used to describe the behavior of atoms in a double-well potential. This approximation can be used to study spin hamiltonians in optical lattices by considering the system as two localized spatial modes separated by a barrier. The double-well potential can be created by superposing two standing waves with different periods and depths.
4. * The behavior of atoms in a double-well potential can be described by a two-site version of the Hubbard model, which includes terms for tunneling, potential bias, and two-body interactions. By tuning the potential bias, it is possible to obtain all the eigenenergies and corresponding eigenstates analytically, which can be used to study spin ordering in the system.",0
100," * The family of iron pnictides is an important prototype system for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity, with various sub-families known to exhibit a phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic crystal symmetry, typically accompanied by long-range antiferromagnetic order.
* Understanding the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is crucial for unveiling the physics underlying superconductivity, but it has proven to be more complex than anticipated. There is ongoing debate about whether magnetic moments are better described by an itinerant or localized model, and the role of correlation effects is still not fully understood.
* Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is an essential experimental tool for studying the electronic structure of iron pnictides, but DFT calculations often struggle to reproduce all features of ARPES spectra accurately, which is often attributed to strong correlation effects.
* The connection between the magnetic phase of iron pnictides and the resulting consequences for ARPES is often overlooked. The formation of twinned crystals during the phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic results in mixed magnetic domains that are orthogonal to each other, causing macroscopic tools like ARPES or transport measurements to only see averaged information, while information on the anisotropy is lost.
* To fully understand the electronic properties of iron pnictide superconductors and the influence of in-plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase, studies on detwinned crystals are mandatory. However, such measurements are connected with several technical difficulties and are rarely done.
* The work mentioned in the text aims to address this issue by conducting a comprehensive DFT study on the magnetic phase of and the corresponding ARPES spectra, with computational results directly comparable to available experimental ARPES data on detwinned crystals. The KKR-GF approach is used to deal with the complex situation, and the impact of disorder due to substitution is handled by the coherent potential approximation (CPA).",1
101," * The M31 globular cluster B158 (also known as BO 158) contains a bright X-ray source called XB158, which has been observed to exhibit strong intensity modulation on a 10017@xmath050 s period.
  * The amplitude of modulation decreases with increasing source intensity, and the behavior is consistent with a neutron star binary with a low mass donor.
  * Analysis of the unfolded 2000 june XMM-Newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation, indicating that the disk is precessing with dips only visible for some part of the super-orbital cycle.
  * This behavior is associated with the ""superhump"" phenomenon observed in accreting binaries where the mass ratio is smaller than 10.3.
  * Superhumps were first identified in the superoutbursts of the SU UMa subclass of cataclysmic variables, and are caused by a tidal instability that occurs when the outer disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the secondary.
  * The disk precession is prograde in the rest frame, and the secondary repeats its motion with respect to the disk on the beat period between the orbital period and the precession period.
  * The secondary modulates the disk's viscous dissipation on this period, giving rise to the maxima in the optical lightcurve known as superhumps.
  * The 0.310 keV luminosity of XB158 varied by a factor of 1.5@xmath00.6 over the course of the 30 Swift observations, and fitting a lightcurve with constant and sinusoidal components revealed a 5.65@xmath00.05 day super-orbital period.
  * The suggested super-orbital period is 170% longer than predicted by 3D SPH simulations, which is likely due to the mass ratio of the donor to the accretor being lower than assumed.",0
102,"• The complex scaling (dilatation) method can reveal a resonance state by the appearance of an isolated complex eigenvalue on the spectrum of the non-hermitian complex scaled hamiltonian. However, the rotation angle must be large enough to rotate the continuum part of the spectrum beyond the resonance's complex eigenvalue.

• The density of states (DOS) method can be used to obtain the energy and lifetime of a resonance state. It relies on the possibility to calculate the Ritz-variational eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for many different values of the non-linear parameter. The DOS method provides a host of approximate values for the energy and lifetime of resonance states, but their accuracy is hard to assess. If supplemented by a new optimization rule, the DOS method can result in a convergent series of approximate values for the energy and lifetime of resonance states.",1
103,"1. The text discusses the concept of @xmath0-symmetric systems, which are non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that can still produce real spectra, making them suitable for describing physical systems. These systems can include complex potentials, subject to certain constraints. Recent developments in optics have led to experimental realizations of @xmath0-symmetric Hamiltonians.
2. The text also discusses the stability of solitons in 2D periodic @xmath0-symmetric potentials and the possibility of creating 2D arrays of optical waveguides with @xmath0-symmetric oligomers (coupled complexes of a few loss- and gain-carrying elements) that may include nonlinearity.
3. The authors propose the creation of 2D plaquettes consisting of four sites (or five sites in one case) as a basic step towards building 2D @xmath0-symmetric lattices. These plaquettes are inspired by earlier works on 2D Hamiltonian lattices and are expected to be accessible with current experimental techniques. The authors plan to study the stationary states supported by these plaquettes and their stability against small perturbations.",0
104," * Hu Aqr is a cataclysmic variable (CV) consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence companion star, with two planets orbiting the binary system.
 
 * The two planets were discovered through irregularities in the observed-calculated variations of the CV, and were found to have a 5.7-mass planet in a tight, eccentric orbit, and a 7.6-mass planet in a wider, eccentric orbit.
 
 * However, the two-planet configuration is dynamically unstable on a 1000-100,000 year timescale, and only a small fraction of numerical simulations show long-term dynamical stability.
 
 * The presence of the inner planet allows for the degeneracy between the donor mass, radius, and core mass at the moment of Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) to be broken, which can be used to derive the rate of mass loss in the common-envelope phase.
 
 * The outer planet can validate this calculation and determine the conditions under which the CV was born.
 
 * The response of the planet's orbit to mass loss depends on the total amount of mass lost and the rate at which it is lost.
 
 * Numerical common-envelope studies indicate that for an in-spiraling binary, the entire envelope can be expelled well within one orbital period of the inner planet, leading to an impulsive response and the possible loss of the planet.",0

2. The NCSM/RGM has been successful in treating two-body cluster systems, but cannot properly describe three-body cluster states, which are important for studying certain nuclear systems such as two-nucleon halo nuclei, resonant systems, and transfer reactions with three fragments in their final states.
3. A three-body cluster configuration has been introduced into the NCSM/RGM, and results for the ground state and continuum states of helium-3 (^3He) within a helium-2 (^2He) + n + n basis have been presented.
4. The NCSM/RGM approach for three-cluster systems involves expanding the many-body wave function over a basis of three-body cluster channel states and solving the resulting system of coupled-channel integral-differential equations.
5. The NCSM/RGM has been applied to the study of the lightest borromean nucleus, helium-4 (^4He), which is formed by an alpha particle and two halo neutrons.
6. The NCSM/RGM has been used to calculate the low-energy phase shifts for different channels in the continuum of helium-3 (^3He), including the experimentally well-known resonance and a second low-lying resonance recently measured at GANIL.",0
106,"* The preparation of thin films of the non-centrosymmetric compound MnSi on silicon substrates has shown promising prospects for future spintronic devices, as they offer a variety of interesting magnetic phases and are easy to integrate into devices due to the use of silicon as a substrate material. The benefit of thin films compared to bulk material is the existence of the skyrmion phase in an extended region of the magnetic phase diagram due to uniaxial anisotropy.
* A suitable candidate for a compound with similar spin order at higher temperatures is the b20 compound MnGe, which has a magnetic ordering temperature of 170K and a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3 nm at lowest temperatures and 6 nm near Tc. The magnetic ground state of MnGe is a helical spin structure with a helix length between 3 nm at lowest temperatures and 6 nm near Tc. Recently, a large topological Hall effect exceeding by 40 times that of MnSi was observed in MnGe, which was attributed to a skyrmion phase.",1
107,"1. The core entropy of a polynomial is a concept introduced by W. Thurston that generalizes the entropy theory of real quadratic maps to complex polynomials. It is defined as the topological entropy of the restriction of the polynomial to its hubbard tree, which is a forward invariant, finite topological tree contained in the filled Julia set.
2. The core entropy function can be extended to a continuous function from the Mandelbrot set to the real numbers, which answers a question posed by W. Thurston. This function displays a rich fractal structure that reflects the underlying geometry of the Mandelbrot set.
3. The core entropy function can be defined purely combinatorially, and it is monotonic and continuous along veins in the Mandelbrot set. The entropy of a polynomial on its Julia set is constant and independent of the external angle, so it does not give information on the parameter.
4. The value of the core entropy is equal, up to a constant factor, to the Hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for the polynomial, and for dendritic Julia sets, it is equal to the asymptotic stretch factor of the polynomial as a rational map. A rational external angle determines a postcritically finite map with a finite hubbard tree, and its entropy can be computed using an algorithm devised by Thurston that considers a larger matrix whose entries are pairs of postcritical angles. This algorithm can be extended to any angle using an infinite version of the algorithm, which is used to prove the continuity of the entropy function.",0
108,"1. * The detection of afterglows from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths suggests that most long GRBs are of cosmological origin, supporting the ""fireball model."" However, the degree of beaming and the energetics involved in GRBs are still not well understood.
2. * There are three methods to determine the degree of beaming in GRBs: (a) based on analytic solutions, a break in the light curve of optical afterglows from a jetted GRB should occur during the relativistic phase; (b) optical afterglows from a jet can be strongly polarized; and (c) due to relativistic beaming effects, the afterglows from the vast majority of jetted GRBs cannot be observed, but the corresponding late time afterglow emission can reach us, which are called orphan afterglows.
3. * However, these methods have limitations and challenges, such as the smoothness of the break in the light curve, the specific conditions required for polarization, and the difficulty in distinguishing an fgrb orphan and a jetted grb orphan. Additionally, there is a proposal that many ""failed"" gamma-ray bursts (fgrbs) may exist, which can only be detected through their long-lasting afterglows, further complicating the identification of orphan afterglows.",0
109,"1. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are elusive events that last for less than a minute and produce X-ray afterglows that can be detected for several hours or days after the burst.
2. The text reports on observations of two GRBs, GRB 011211 and GRB 001025, made by various satellites including BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton, and RXTE.
3. GRB 011211 was a long-duration, faint event, and an optical afterglow was detected and found to be associated with a host galaxy with a redshift of z=2.14.
4. GRB 001025 was detected by the RXTE all-sky monitor and had a peak flux of 154 Crab units, but no optical afterglow was detected.
5. XMM-Newton observed the location of GRB 001025 and detected two X-ray sources, one of which is likely the afterglow of the GRB.
6. The spectra of both GRBs can be described by a simple power law with photon index ~2, and no significant spectral evolution was found during the observations.
7. The overall spectral shape of the GRB afterglows can be fit to a model of synchrotron emission with possible inclusion of inverse Compton scattering. No significant absorption above the galactic values has been detected in the X-ray spectra.",0
110,"1. Ai3, a layered organic material, has recently regained interest due to the discovery of low-energy massless Dirac fermions under hydrostatic pressure.
2. Ai3 is different from graphene and topological insulators in several ways, including the tilt of Dirac cones, anisotropy in the Fermi surface, smaller average Fermi velocity, and the presence of additional massive carriers near the Fermi level.
3. The effective coupling constant for Coulomb-type electron-electron interactions is expected to be ten times larger in ai3 than in graphene due to the smaller Fermi velocity.
4. Recent studies on ai3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure have shown the existence of high-mobility Dirac carriers and low-mobility massive holes, with the interplay between both carrier types being the main result.
5. The measured mobilities for the two carrier types suggest scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short-range scatterers.
6. The carrier density and mobility in ai3 have a strong two-dimensional character and can be extracted from the magneto-conductivity curve.
7. The strong temperature dependence of the carrier density suggests the absence of charge inhomogeneities, which is a common issue in graphene on SiO2 substrates.
8. The analysis of the data is based on the study of the magneto-conductivity and is similar to the one presented in ref. for multi-carrier semiconductor systems.",0

2. * FEBS can be divided into two subclasses: pnictides and chalcogenides, both with a square lattice of iron as the basic element.
3. * The Fermi surface (FS) of FEBS is formed by Fe-orbitals and consists of two hole sheets around the @xmath11 point and two electron sheets around the @xmath12 and @xmath13 points in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.
4. * Nesting between these two groups of sheets leads to enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, resulting in different mechanisms of Cooper pair formation and distinct superconducting gap symmetry and structure.
5. * Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a useful tool for probing the gap structure, as the measured dynamical spin susceptibility in the superconducting state carries information about the gap structure.
6. * Recent measurements of gaps via Andreev spectroscopy show that there are at least two distinct gaps present in 11, 122, and 1111 systems, and even three gaps in LiFeAs.
7. * The very existence of the smaller gap raises the question of what the spin resonance frequency would be in a system with two distinct gaps, as the naive expectation is that the frequency shifts to the lower gap scale.
8. * The peak in INS in the BaCo122 system at a frequency of 25 meV cannot be the spin resonance, as it is greater than the naively expected spin resonance frequency, and could instead be coming from the @xmath6 state.",0
112,"1. * The presence of impurities can significantly alter the properties of a quantum system, including its coherence and transport properties.
2. * In the absence of interactions, if the impurity distribution is completely random, all states of the system are exponentially localized in 1D and 2D, while a mobility edge exists in 3D.
3. * If the impurity positions are correlated, some delocalized states can appear in the system. This has been demonstrated in 1D using the random dimer model (RDMD) and the dual random dimer model (DRDMD).
4. * The effects of correlated disorder have been studied in various physical contexts in 1D, but are mostly unexplored in 2D.
5. * In a 2D system with short-range correlated disorder, there exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent and the states around this energy are delocalized.
6. * The resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and is the same as the resonance energy in the 1D DRDMD.

113,"1. The text discusses the Generalized Petersen Graphs (GPGs), which are a class of graphs with unique properties and have been widely studied. The paper focuses on finding upper and lower bounds for the independence number (the size of a largest independent set) of GPGs, specifically for even values of k. The authors provide a construction for an independent set in GPGs for even k and even numbers of vertices, and they prove a lower bound for GPGs with odd values of k and even numbers of vertices. They also mention that their lower bounds are better than those obtained in previous works.
2. The paper also discusses the conjecture that the independence number of GPGs with fixed k can be found in linear time. The authors prove this conjecture by showing that for every fixed k and any integer n, the treewidth of GPGs is bounded. They define the concepts of tree decomposition and treewidth of a graph and provide an algorithm for finding a maximum independent set of a graph with bounded treewidth. The authors show that for any fixed k, the problem of finding the independence number of GPGs can be solved by an algorithm with a running time that is linear in the number of vertices.",0
114,"1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is often considered unconditionally secure, but in practice, it is difficult for devices to meet the requirements for security, leading to successful attacks.
2. To combat practical attacks, countermeasures such as device-independent security proofs and experimental measures have been proposed.
3. A new scheme called Measurement Device Independent QKD (MDIQKD) has been proposed, which removes all potential loopholes of detectors without sacrificing performance.
4. MDIQKD has been shown to cover about twice the distance of standard decoyed QKD, and the only assumption needed is that the preparation of quantum signal sources by Alice and Bob is (almost) perfect.
5. The characterization of the signal source is easier than that of the detection unit, and with MDIQKD, the focus shifts from imperfections of the measurement unit to imperfections of signal sources.
6. One important imperfection of the sources is the basis-dependent flaw, which decreases the achievable distance in standard BB84. To investigate the practicality of MDIQKD, the security under this imperfection needs to be analyzed.
7. The paper proposes two phase encoding MDIQKD schemes and proves their unconditional security with basis-dependent flaw, and simulates the key generation rate with realistic parameters.",0

4. Class II methanol masers are found to exclusively trace regions of massive star formation and are generally not associated or offset from UCHII regions.
5. A study of three star-forming regions observed at high spatial resolution has revealed multiple embedded sources inside the cores, suggesting the presence of multiple systems or close sources due to projection effects.
6. Monte Carlo simulations show that generating the observed mass distributions of the most massive stars is difficult, suggesting that the mass distribution of the most massive stars cannot be produced by sampling a standard form of the IMF from the reservoir of gas available for star formation.",0
116,"1. The text discusses the use of modified theories of gravity to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. The authors focus on the Lovelock theory of gravity, which is a generalization of general relativity to higher dimensions. The Gauss-Bonnet invariant, a scalar quantity derived from the Riemann tensor, is used to study the dynamics of the gravitational system in 4-dimensions. The authors also discuss the coupling between matter Lagrangian and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which leads to non-geodesic motion of massive test particles.
2. The text also discusses the reconstruction technique, which is used to find the form of the scalar-field potential that reproduces a given cosmic evolution. The authors use this technique to study the stability of cosmic evolutionary models in modified theories of gravity. They also discuss the Noether symmetry approach, which is used to construct cosmologically viable models in modified gravity.
3. The authors apply the reconstruction technique to study the stability of de Sitter and power-law solutions in the context of Lovelock gravity. They find that the de Sitter solution is unstable for certain models, while the power-law solution is stable for other models. The authors also discuss the limitations of modified gravity in explaining the cosmological evolution, particularly during the radiation and matter dominated eras.",0
117," * Majorana fermions (MFs) are real solutions of the Dirac equation that are their own antiparticles. They were originally proposed as a model for neutrinos but have recently been predicted to occur as quasiparticle bound states in engineered condensed matter systems.
 
 * MFs obey non-Abelian statistics, which is important for realizing potential applications in decoherence-free quantum computation and quantum information processing. They are predicted to appear in tunneling spectroscopy experiments as characteristic zero-bias peaks (ZBPs).
 
 * Experimental evidence for MFs in condensed matter systems has been reported in topological superconductors, including topological insulators, semiconductor nanowires, and atomic chains. However, these results cannot serve as definitive proof of the existence of MFs and it is challenging to uniquely distinguish MFs from conventional fermionic subgap states.
 
 * Theoretical predictions of ZBPs have been observed experimentally in semiconductor nanowires, but these peaks can also appear due to other mechanisms such as the Kondo resonance and disorder or band bending. Additionally, Andreev bound states in a magnetic field can also exhibit a zero-energy crossing, leading to similar conductance features.
 
 * Most experimental evidence for MFs relies on measurements of the tunneling conductance, and identifying MFs only through tunnel spectroscopy is problematic. Therefore, alternative setups or proposals for detecting MFs are necessary.
 
 * An all-optical scheme for detecting MFs using a hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system is proposed. This scheme avoids introducing signals that can disturb the detection of MFs by using an optical pump-probe technique with no direct contact between MFs and the hybrid quantum dot-nanomechanical resonator system.
 
 * The optical scheme provides a new platform for applications ranging from robust manipulation of MFs and MFs-based quantum information processing. The exciton resonance spectrum of the probe field is enhanced significantly by the vibration of the nanomechanical resonator, making MFs more sensitive to be detectable.",0
118," * The first evidence of time reversal symmetry violation was found in the kaon system, but no other signals have been discovered to date. Despite this, studying time reversal symmetry has become a crucial aspect of searching for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles.
 * There are various alternatives or extensions of the standard model, each implying specific ways of time reversal symmetry violation. These theories are formulated in terms of quarks and leptons, while nuclear low energy tests involve hadronic degrees of freedom. To relate hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom, effective hadronic potentials are introduced, which have been useful in treating nuclear structure and extracting effective hadronic coupling constants. However, relating hadronic degrees of freedom to quark degrees of freedom is challenging due to the absence of a complete solution of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at the energies considered.",0
119,"1. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by the absence of hydrogen and strong silicon lines in their spectra at maximum brightness. They are used as standard candles to measure distances to remote galaxies due to their uniform light curves and high luminosity.
2. The accreting white dwarf (WD) model is a plausible explosion model for SNe Ia. In this model, a WD in a binary system accretes material from a companion star, increasing its mass until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes.
3. The accreting WD model has made significant progress since the introduction of stellar wind from the WD. This model has been successful in sustaining stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.
4. The accreting WD model predicts two main evolutionary paths leading to SNe Ia: the super soft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic channel. These paths determine the type of companion stars that lead to SNe Ia.
5. The companion star of Tycho Brahe's supernova remnant (SNR) has not been confirmed observationally. However, a group claimed to have identified a G2IV star as the companion by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the SNR.
6. The identification of the companion star of a SN Ia can be confirmed by observing the presence of broad wings in the blue side of absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star. This indicates that the star is located inside the SN ejecta.
7. The amount of Fe I in the ejecta of Tycho's SNR can be estimated by taking into account collisional processes in non-equilibrium and ionizations by photons emitted from the shocked ejecta. The resulting spectra can be used to identify the feature of Fe I absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star.",0
120,"1. Quantum entanglement is a physical resource that can be manipulated and characterized independently of its physical realization, and obeys a set of conservation laws. It is useful in making quantitative predictions and is regarded as a physical resource. The entropy of entanglement is a well-established measure of entanglement for pure states, but the quantification of entanglement becomes less clear for mixed states.
2. The density operator of a mixed state can be decomposed in infinitely many ways, leading to infinitely many values for the average entanglement. To circumvent this problem, various measures have been proposed, such as the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation. These measures give the value zero for certain states, which might be counterintuitive, but is unavoidable due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding a mixed state.
3. The problem of bipartite entanglement for an open system is one of tripartite entanglement for the system and environment. To characterize the entanglement in a more complete way, Nha and Carmichael introduced a measure of entanglement for open systems based on quantum trajectory unravelings of the open system dynamics. This approach considers the way in which information about the system is read from the environment, and the entanglement measure is contextual depending on the kind of measurements made.
4. The text also discusses the behavior of a cascaded qubit system coupled through the one-way exchange of photons. The system can produce unconditional entangled states, and the entanglement dynamics of this system are analyzed using quantum trajectory theory. The analysis demonstrates bimodality in the conditional dynamics, where the approach to the bell state is only one of two possibilities for the asymptotic evolution. This behavior is similar to that of a bimodal system in classical statistical physics in the limit of a vanishing transition rate between attractors.",0

* The difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is explained by angle-dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad-line region, caused by a dusty medium called the ""dust torus.""
* The dust in the torus absorbs incident UV/optical radiation and re-emits the energy in the infrared. Type 1 AGN show more emission in the near-IR than Type 2 AGN for the same intrinsic luminosity.
* High-spatial resolution observations or high-luminosity objects can be used to probe the wavelength dependence of this anisotropy in the infrared, which can help distinguish between smooth and cloud-based torus models.
* The anisotropy in the infrared can be used to form isotropic AGN samples based on infrared fluxes, but it is important to understand the bias towards Type 1 AGN that may occur when invoking flux limits.
* The sample of quasars and radio galaxies at 12 microns presented in [xcite] was selected isotropically and can be used to study the intrinsic anisotropy of the infrared emission of the dust torus.

122,"1. * Continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) has achieved significant improvements in theoretical analysis and experimental implementation, with practical implementation systems demonstrating secure communication over tens of kilometers.* The security of such systems with prepare-and-measure (PM) implementation has been confirmed through the security analysis of the equivalent entanglement-based (EB) scheme. However, the traditional security analysis of the EB scheme in CVQKD only includes the signal beam and not the local oscillator (LO), which is necessary for balanced homodyne detection and within an eavesdropper's (Eve's) manipulating domain. This leaves security loopholes that Eve can exploit.
2. * In practical CVQKD implementation, the fluctuations of LO intensity can compromise the secret keys severely if Bob does not scale his measurements with the instantaneous LO intensity values.* This is because the excess noise caused by imperfect subtraction of the balanced homodyne detector (BHD) in the presence of LO intensity fluctuations can be exploited by Eve. Although monitoring LO intensity is common in practical systems, the effect of small fluctuations on the secret key rate is not yet fully understood.
3. * The paper analyzes the effect of LO intensity fluctuation on the secret key rate for reverse reconciliation under Eve's attack on the intensity of LO during key distribution.* The analysis shows that the truly secret key rate decreases rapidly over long distances or small channel transmissions with various values of LO transmission controlled by Eve. Subtracting the secret key rate estimated by Bob without monitoring LO intensity from the one with monitoring can estimate Eve's intercepted information.
4. * The paper also discusses the challenge of accurately monitoring LO intensity, especially for reverse reconciliation communication over long distances, and the potential impact of imperfections in BHD.* Proper monitoring and scaling of measurements with instantaneous intensity values of LO are crucial in the practical implementation of CVQKD to ensure security against Eve's attacks.",0
123,"1. The text discusses the development of a code for computing adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models, with a focus on accuracy and flexibility in choosing integration methods and determining all frequencies of a given model within a specified range of degree and frequency. The code is inspired by the work of @xcite and provides extensive documentation.
2. The equilibrium model is defined in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables, as well as mass, radius, and other physical properties. The code also introduces a new set of dependent variables for efficiently calculating modes of arbitrarily high degree in a complete model. Boundary conditions are obtained from series expansions and matched continuously to the solution in an isothermal atmosphere.
3. The code can solve the equations on the interval from the center to the surface of the star, including the atmosphere, and can handle both radial and nonradial oscillations. The programme permits solving these equations with two basic techniques: a shooting method and a relaxation technique. The eigenvalues are found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point.
4. The code uses a standard secant technique to find the eigenfrequencies as the zeros of a smooth function, and allows for scanning through a given interval in the frequency range to look for changes of sign of the function. The programme also includes techniques for improving the precision of the computed frequencies, such as the use of a variational principle and Richardson extrapolation.",0
124,"1. Highly structured Hi distribution, including cavities, shells, and supershells, is a common manifestation in gas-rich galaxies.
2. Supershells are found in various galaxies, such as NGC 5775, NGC 4631, NGC 3044, and NGC 3556, and are interpreted as expanding supershells due to their loop-like or circular appearance and velocity range.
3. The two main classes of explanations for supershells propose internal or external sources of kinetic energy. The internal source model involves starbursts, stellar winds, and supernova explosions, while the external source hypothesis suggests infall of massive gas clouds on to the galactic plane due to gravitational interaction with neighboring galaxies.
4. The main difficulty with the starburst model for Hi supershells is the required input energies for the largest shells, which often require staggering numbers of supernova events.
5. Observations of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) around the Milky Way and signatures of interaction in M101 and NGC 4631 support the external source hypothesis.
6. Recent observations reveal galaxies with extremely large Hi supershells but no evidence of interaction or nearby companions, suggesting a new explanation for Hi supershells.
7. The proposed explanation is that Hi supershells are formed by radio jets plowing through the interstellar medium (ISM), accreting ISM gas, and sometimes inflating bubbles.
8. This new explanation allows for an internal energy source for the Hi shells, provides a natural explanation for any spatial symmetries seen in the Hi features, and resolves the energy problem.",0

126,"1. The paper discusses the principal eigenvalue of a fractional Laplacian with a zero-divergence drift on a bounded domain with a simply connected, 1-regular boundary.
2. The authors define the set of nonzero first integrals in a Sobolev space equipped with a norm coming from the Dirichlet form of the fractional Laplacian.
3. The main difficulty in the development is the roughness of general elements of the Sobolev space and the non-locality of the fractional Laplacian.
4. The authors use conditioning, approximation techniques, and properties of the Green function and heat kernel of gradient perturbations of the fractional Laplacian to define and study the principal eigen-pair.
5. The main result is that if the drift is of zero divergence, then the principal eigenvalue is bounded and the infimum is attained.
6. The authors note that the use of the Green function is more robust when dealing with limited differentiability and non-locality.
7. The non-locality of the quadratic forms also requires substantial modifications in the proof of the upper bound.

131,"1. AQL X-1 is a soft X-ray transient (SXRT) that shows similar properties to persistent low mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (LMXRBs) when in outburst. The large variations in accretion rate in SXRTs allow for the investigation of regimes for neutron stars that are inaccessible to LMXRBs. The origin of the low luminosity X-ray emission detected in the quiescent state of several SXRTs is unclear, but it is suggested that a millisecond radio pulsar (MSP) may turn on during this time, providing a link between LMXRBs and recycled MSps.
2. AQL X-1 has an orbital period of 19 hours and is the most active SXRT known, with over 30 X-ray and/or optical outbursts detected so far. The outbursts are generally characterized by a fast rise and slow decay, with the X-ray spectrum becoming harder as the luminosity decreases. The sharp decrease in flux leading to the quiescent state of AQL X-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts, but there are differences in X-ray luminosities and spectra due to the different efficiencies in gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars.
3. During the February-March 1997 outburst of AQL X-1, Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations led to the discovery of a nearly coherent modulation at 450 Hz (4.5 ms) during a type I X-ray burst and a single quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) peak at two different flux levels. The presence of a single QPO peak and the burst periodicity at 450 Hz may represent the neutron star spin frequency or half its value. However, the possibility of accretion onto the neutron star surface taking place in the quiescent state of AQL X-1 faces serious difficulties, as a low magnetic field would be required, which is unlikely for aql X-1 and LMXRBs with kHz QPOs.

3. The spatial coincidence between the LBV-like event and SN 2006jc led to follow-up observations in various wavebands, including X-ray, ultra-violet, optical, infrared, and radio.

5. A bright blue continuum was observed in the optical spectrum at early epochs, which had also been seen in type II SN 1988Z, but its origin remains unclear.
6. The optical light curve showed a rapid decline from 50 days after discovery, while near-infrared emissions brightened.
7. The near-infrared brightening and the fact that the redder side of the helium emission profile declined faster than the bluer side were interpreted as evidence of ongoing dust formation.

134,"1. The extinction curve describes how extinction changes with wavelength and is necessary for dereddening magnitudes and colors of astronomical objects and understanding the physical properties of dust grains. Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis (CCM) derived a mean extinction law that depends on one parameter, which they called @xmath0. They obtained a one-parameter family of curves that represents the UV to IR extinction law in terms of @xmath0, where @xmath0 characterizes the dust properties in the region that produces the extinction. Many authors have used this parameter to study extinction.
2. The interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes and reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam by absorption and scattering. The apparent magnitude of each star as a function of wavelength may be written as @xmath10, where @xmath12, @xmath13, and @xmath14 represent absolute magnitude, distance, and total extinction, respectively. The extinction as a function of @xmath15 may be obtained by comparing corresponding stars paired according to spectral properties. The magnitude difference obtained from equation ([mred]) and ([mcomp]) is given by @xmath18, where @xmath19 is a constant term and may be eliminated by normalizing with respect to extinction difference in two standard wavelengths @xmath20 and @xmath21. The extinction curves are generally normalized with respect to the B and V passbands in the Johnson system.",0

Grover's algorithm can search an unsorted database with a quadratic advantage over classical methods. It has been implemented in various physical systems, including superconducting qubits.
2. The text discusses the implementation of a three-qubit Grover search algorithm using four-level superconducting qubits (SQUIDs) in a cavity QED system. The scheme uses a three-qubit phase gate, which simplifies the implementation and reduces the possibility of errors compared to conventional gate decomposition methods. The authors also consider the effects of spontaneous decay and cavity decay on the performance of the algorithm.
3. The proposed implementation of the three-qubit Grover algorithm using SQUIDs has an estimated operational time of approximately 243 ns for the three-qubit controlled phase gate and 0.244 µs for single-qubit gates, resulting in a total implementation time of around 0.487 µs for two iterations. The authors also discuss how to minimize unwanted interactions between microwave pulses and cavity field modes.

140,"1. In the 1970s, many-body theory flourished, with much attention on many-body effects on XPS spectra from deep core levels in metals. Related effects included singularities near edges in absorption and emission spectra.
2. In metals, CB electrons can have various effects on the XPS peak from the core level. If the excitation is adiabatic, the screening of the core hole by CB electrons would lead to a shift of the peak to higher kinetic energy. However, if the excitation is swift, the CB electrons are shaken up and left in a non-equilibrium state.
3. This shake-up effect is analogous to removing a cork from a glass of water slowly or briskly, leading to different states of the water. In a metal, water waves correspond to plasmons, collective excitations of CB electrons. Shake-up effects show up as plasmon replicas in the spectrum.
4. The main peak corresponds to the system left in a quasi-equilibrium state, while subsequent peaks correspond to states with an increasing number of excited plasmons. Single-particle excitations can also occur, leading to a deformation and low-energy tail in both the main peak and plasmon replicas.
5. In graphene, the chemical potential is not inside an energy band or a band gap, making it a special case. Despite this, there is still a low-energy tailing in the XPS spectra. In doped graphene, the chemical potential is inside an energy band, leading to a tailing and collective excitations (2D plasmons) that contribute to the tail.
6. The authors address pristine and doped graphene, using a model based on one used by Langreth in the 1970s. The XPS line shape is derived for a 2D system, and results and comparisons with experimental spectra are presented.
7. The excitation process involves the photoelectron leaving the system and a core hole being left behind. The shape of the XPS spectrum depends on the speed of the process. In this work, the sudden approximation is used, assuming the core-hole potential is turned on instantaneously.

2. The thin-interface limit of two-sided phase-field models cannot eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness, and the standard equation of motion for orientation-field models is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter.
3. The inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase-field equations is challenging, and the standard approach cannot be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation.
4. The precision and performance of phase-field models have been enhanced in the last decade, but physical effects due to the diffuseness of the interface must be controlled to guarantee precise simulations.
5. The thin-interface limit is used to analyze the equations of the phase-field model under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale, yielding effective boundary conditions that contain all effects of the finite interface thickness.
6. The antitrapping current was introduced to eliminate macroscopic discontinuities in the phase-field model, but it cannot be eliminated simply by the choice of appropriate interpolation functions.
7. There are two independent thin-interface effects, one proportional to the interface velocity and one proportional to the current, and a general solution to eliminate both effects does not seem to exist.
8. The size and shape of crystalline grains formed upon solidification are essential for materials properties, and phase-field models must be capable of dealing with the evolution of polycrystals during solidification and subsequent evolution of the grain structure.

143,"1. The fundamental atmospheric and physical parameters of stars, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, mass, and age, are crucial for chemo-dynamical studies of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group. Large spectroscopic surveys like SEGUE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO, and HERMES are used to determine these parameters and infer the characteristics of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. Spectroscopic methods are essential for accurately measuring metallicity, and high-resolution spectroscopy is used to correct low-resolution results. Spectroscopic parameters can be used alone or in combination with photometric information to fit individual stars to theoretical isochrones or evolutionary tracks and determine their mass, age, and distance.
2. A common method for deriving spectroscopic atmospheric parameters is to use the information from Fe and Fe absorption lines under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). However, both observational and theoretical evidence suggests that systematic biases are present in such analyses due to the breakdown of the LTE assumption, particularly at low metallicity and/or surface gravity. Recent studies have quantified the effects of non-LTE on the determination of surface gravity and metallicity, revealing substantial systematic biases. Developing sophisticated methods to reconcile these effects is essential for deriving accurate spectroscopic parameters, which is the focus of a series of papers. The first paper in the series utilizes the RAVE survey to formulate a methodology for deriving very accurate atmospheric parameters, focusing on the Balmer line method and on-the-fly NLTE corrections to Fe lines. The authors verify their method using a sample of standard stars and find significant systematic biases compared to standard 1D, LTE techniques for stellar spectral analysis. NLTE effects in iron are most prominent in low-metallicity stars, which is why the authors chose a metal-poor sample from the RAVE survey for their study.",0
144,"1. Weak gravitational lensing, which causes distortions in the light from distant objects due to the gravitational pull of massive structures in the foreground, has been detected in samples of high-redshift quasars (QSOs), intermediate-redshift galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It can manifest as angular correlations between these sources and foreground mass inhomogeneities, or as a coherent shear effect in the case of galaxies.
2. Another way to detect weak lensing is by using the fluxes of standard candles, such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). If the observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances, the effect of lensing can be seen as brighter sources lying behind regions of mass density excess, while fainter ones have mass deficits in their foregrounds.
3. The best example of a cosmological standard candle is SNe Ia, which have been extensively observed to determine the global geometry of the universe. Nuisance effects such as evolution, variations in individual SNe, and gray dust extinction have been studied and corrected for or shown to be small. Weak lensing, another nuisance effect, has been addressed theoretically and found to be unimportant given current uncertainties.
4. The largest homogeneous compilation of SNe Ia contains 74 SNe, and the authors use four different light curve fitting methods to estimate distances to SNe Ia. The final quoted distance is the median of the estimates of the four individual methods, and the uncertainty is the median of the error of the contributing methods.
5. The authors use APM galaxies as tracers of foreground mass density. APM provides near full coverage of the sky in the northern and southern hemispheres, and in the analysis, only the central regions of APM plates are used. The median redshift of the 55 SNe in the usable parts of APM plates is 0.423. The main goal of the work is to determine if the observed fluxes of cosmologically distant SNe Ia have suffered significantly from lensing-induced (de-)amplifications.",0

2. The low-temperature state of HF metals is a lattice-coherent Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles and coherently screened spins, transitioning to incoherent screening via independent Kondo scattering at higher temperatures.
3. Physical properties of HF metals are typically anomalous, with a non-monotonic temperature dependence of resistivity and rich structure in optics.
4. Theoretical treatments of HF metals are based on the periodic Anderson model (PAM) or its strong coupling limit, the Kondo lattice model.
5. Dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) has been a major framework for understanding HF metals, but it does not provide a method to solve the PAM.
6. Various methods have been used to solve the PAM, including numerical renormalization group, quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, and theoretical approaches like perturbation theory, iterated perturbation theory, and large-mean field theory.
7. The local moment approach (LMA) is employed to provide a many-body description of dynamical and transport properties of paramagnetic HF metals, making direct quantitative comparisons with experiment.
8. The LMA is a non-perturbative technique that introduces the notion of local moments, leading to a two-self-energy description that captures correlated spin-flip dynamics.
9. The LMA has been successful in describing the transport and optical properties of kondo insulators, particularly in strong coupling, where it exhibits scaling behavior and excellent agreement with experiment.",0
146,"1. The kinetics of polymer loop formation has been studied extensively, with recent focus on its importance in biology. DNA loop formation is crucial for genetic expression, replication, and recombination. For example, in E. coli, the Lac repressor-mediated loop is essential for the repressive regulation of Lac genes. Hairpin loop formation is the elementary step in protein folding and structure formation in RNA folding.
2. The cell interior is an active and nonequilibrium medium, with a DNA fragment about to loop subject to temporally fluctuating forces due to its dynamic environment. Recent experiments have shown that the power spectrum of the fluctuating force exerted on the cytoskeleton is an order of magnitude larger than expected from thermal equilibrium conditions. Single molecule experiment techniques have provided detailed information on DNA loop formation, such as the observation of LacI-mediated DNA loop formation and dissociation by monitoring nanoscale Brownian motion of a micron-sized particle attached to one end of the DNA.
3. Theoretical studies have investigated the effects of nonlinear elasticity, tension, and enzymes on DNA loop formation. A transfer matrix method was developed to calculate the semiflexible polymer end-to-end distance distribution function and loop formation probability. Similar results were obtained using an elastic theory of a semiflexible polymer. However, quantitative comparison to experiments is difficult due to the free energy given an arbitrary chain end-to-end distance.
4. Experimental studies have shown that static tension can increase the looping time for DNA loop formation, while fluctuating tension can reduce the looping time. A theory including the complexity of DNA loop formation and further controlled experiments are needed for quantitative comparison. Theoretical studies have also investigated the effects of static tension on protein-mediated DNA loop formation, showing that a tension of 0.5 pN can increase the looping time by more than two orders of magnitude for loop sizes larger than 100 base pair distance.",0
147,"1. Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the dynamics of close binary systems such as star-star or star-planet systems.
2. These interactions can lead to phenomena like synchronization, orbital circularization, tidal capture, disruption, and fall of an object onto the star.
3. The paper investigates the tidal interaction of a star and a point source (which can be a star or a planet) by considering the stellar evolution.
4. The evolution time scales of eccentricity or semimajor axis strongly depend on the orbital period and can take values up to 108 yr or more for some stellar models.
5. The study focuses on three types of stars with masses of one, one and a half, and two solar masses, without considering their rotation and magnetic field.
6. The problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star-planet system.
7. The low-frequency g-modes of stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides.
8. The tidal interactions are intense at small periastron distances, and a large number of exoplanets in stellar systems have been discovered, including short-period massive planets with an orbital period of a few days.
9. The paper's results can be directly applied to some of these systems, such as the system YBP1194, which has a solar twin star and a planet with a mass of 0.34 and a period of only 6.9 days.
10. The paper also discusses the possibility of a planet falling onto the star due to quasi-static tides and provides a plot showing the threshold as a function of planetary mass and orbital period.",0
148," * Nano-optics is the study of light on the nanoscale and involves overcoming the diffraction limit of light microscopy.
 * Early work in nano-optics focused on near-field optical microscopy, but recent advances in fluorescence microscopy have pushed the resolution of far-field imaging down to the nanometer range.
 * These subwavelength imaging methods rely on the accurate localization of individual fluorescent markers, which are isolated based on their optical characteristics or by selective or random activation.
 * The location of an isolated fluorescent marker is limited only by photon noise, not the diffraction barrier.
 * A key issue affecting these subwavelength imaging methods is the optical transparency of the media surrounding the light emitters.
 * Fluorescence microscopy provides noninvasive imaging of the interior of cells and allows the detection of specific cellular constituents through fluorescence tagging.
 * However, certain biological tissues or soft-matter systems can appear turbid due to intense scattering of photons, which can produce a blurred image with no apparent information about the source position.
 * Techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used to measure the distance between individual nano-objects without imaging their position.
 * FRET relies on the near-field energy transfer between two fluorophores emitting at different wavelengths and is not very sensitive to scattering problems.
 * The paper proposes a new approach to obtain information about the relative distance between two identical incoherent point sources in a disordered environment based on the analysis of the fluctuations of the emitted light.",0
149,"1. The text discusses the mechanical behavior of cells and how it can be explained using polymer physics models. It mentions the success of the glassy wormlike chain (GWC) model in describing the rheological data of polymer solutions and living cells over many decades with a minimum of parameters. However, the model was primarily concerned with viscoelastic behavior, while recent investigations have highlighted the glassy, fragile, and inelastic character of the mechanical response of living cells.
2. The text also discusses the extension of the GWC model to situations involving inelastic deformations, specifically reversible inelastic behavior where the deformation does not alter the microscopic ground state. It presents a theoretical framework for a polymer-based description of the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behavior of sticky biopolymer networks.
3. The text also highlights the importance of the prestressing force in cells, which is present even in the absence of external driving. It notes that increasing prestress is correlated with a higher stiffness of adhering cells, while the simple physical theory presented in the text predicts the opposite. It suggests that the cell actively adapts its structure such that a certain set of thermodynamic state variables remain in a physiologically sensible range, which implies that the cell will respond to stiff substrates or persistent external stresses by a biological remodelling that corresponds to an increase of certain parameters and possibly to a decrease of others.",0
150,"1. Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with non-trivial topological invariants and robust surface metallic states, typically realized in systems with strong spin-orbit interaction. However, all known TIs contain heavy or rare metal elements, which poses constraints on the search for topological materials. A proposed solution is to generate effective spin-orbit couplings from ubiquitous Coulomb repulsions among electrons. An extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice has been proposed to generate an effective spin-orbit interaction from a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the Hartree-Fock mean-field level, leading to a topologically non-trivial phase called a topological Mott insulator (TMI).
2. Despite theoretical proposals, the TMI phase has not been achieved in real materials, and its stability against competing orders and quantum fluctuations is unclear. Examining charge fluctuations with finite momentum over entire Brillouin zones and employing functional renormalization group methods have been proposed as ways to clarify the competitions among TMIs and charge density waves (CDWs). However, first-order thermal or quantum phase transitions not characterized by diverging order-parameter fluctuations are hard to capture by such theoretical methods. The most plausible symmetry-breaking competing with TMIs is a first-order quantum phase transition.
3. In a study of the TMI on the honeycomb lattice, it was found that a long-period CDW is much more stable compared to that of short period and competes severely with the TMI. However, reducing the Fermi velocity of the Dirac cones tends to stabilize the TMI. The realization of the TMI in the extended Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice was studied by controlling the Fermi velocity and employing a variational Monte Carlo method with many variational parameters. It was found that suppressing the Fermi velocity to a tenth of that of the original honeycomb lattice leads to the emergence of the TMI in an extended parameter region as a spontaneous symmetry breaking even when many-body and quantum fluctuations are taken into account.",0

* Graphene has attracted interest from various communities, including those working on atomic scale circuit devices and those searching for new topological phases.
* Both communities have sought ways to gap the massless Dirac spectrum, and the realization of a gate-induced band gap in bilayer graphene has brought the possibility of a graphene-based transistor closer to reality.
* However, the sub-gap conductance measured in bilayer graphene has introduced a new puzzle, as the gapped bilayer is not as insulating as it should be.
* The predicted topological gapless channel of transport along recently imaged AB-BA tilt boundary networks may solve this puzzle and realize the first observation of a topological surface(edge) state hosted by a structural topological defect.
* Theoretical interest in topological gapless modes hosted by structural topological defects has not yet resulted in an observed mode.
* Lattice dislocations in three-dimensional crystals are not directly accessible, but tilt boundaries have been observed in graphene.
* These tilt boundaries can host gapless modes of topological origin and form the first example of a naked structural defect hosting topological electronic states.

152,"1. Ionizable polymers in water can be classified as polyelectrolytes or polyampholytes, depending on the charge of their monomers.
2. Polyelectrolytes have a single sign of charged monomers, while polyampholytes have charged monomers of both signs.
3. The sequence of charged monomers on polyampholytes affects their behavior, including aggregation, self-assembly, and adsorption to charged surfaces.
4. Polymers anchored on a surface can form a brush structure if there is a strong repulsion between the polymers.
5. Electrostatic interactions in a polyelectrolyte brush can introduce additional length scales and affect the thickness of the brush.
6. At high grafting densities and charge fractions, most counterions are trapped inside the polyelectrolyte brush, and the thickness of the brush is determined by the competition between osmotic pressure and elasticity.
7. In a brush of overally neutral polyampholyte chains, most counterions are outside the brush and the electrostatic correlations tend to decrease the chains size and the brush thickness.
8. Brushes formed by grafted diblock polyampholytes have been studied using lattice mean field modeling and computer simulation.
9. The effect of chain stiffness, charge density, and grafting density on spherical brushes of diblock polyampholytes and interaction between colloids with grafted diblock polyampholytes have been studied using Monte Carlo simulations.
10. The paper studies planar brushes of flexible, semiflexible, and rodlike diblock polyampholytes using MD simulations in a wide range of grafting density and finds that the average brush thickness linearly depends on the grafting density, regardless of the chains' flexibility. However, the strength of this dependence is weaker in the case of the brush of flexible polyampholytes. The histograms of their equilibrium conformations are noticeably different, with inter-chain correlations being too weak in the brush of flexible polyampholytes and the brush properties being dominantly determined by single chain behavior. In the cases of the brushes of semiflexible and rodlike polyampholytes, collective behavior of the chains is dominant and dependence of",0
153,"1. The text discusses the use of scalar diquark fields to construct tetraquark currents in order to study the nonet scalar mesons as tetraquark states with new QCD sum rules. The authors take the scalar diquarks as point particles and describe them as basic quantum fields, then introduce color gauge interactions and construct tetraquark currents consisting of scalar fields. The numerical values obtained from the new sum rules are compatible with experimental data and theoretical estimations, and the diquark currents have the advantage of satisfying the two criteria of QCD sum rules more easily compared to conventional quark currents.
2. The text also discusses the contribution of intermediate pseudoscalar meson loops to the correlation function, which gives the scalar meson a Breit-Wigner width. The authors observe that the scalar mesons can be generated dynamically from the unitarized scattering amplitudes of pseudoscalar mesons, and they take into account those meson loops effectively by replacing the hadronic spectral density with the physical values and ignoring the energy scale dependence of the mass and pole residue for simplicity. The modified masses obtained from the QCD sum rules are shown to be better compared to experimental data.",0
154,"• The text discusses the use of a numerical method called pseudo-transient continuation (PTC) in power system long-term stability analysis. PTC is a theoretically-based method that can accelerate simulation speed and overcome numerical difficulties in both the long-term stability model and the quasi-steady-state (QSS) model.

• The paper presents three numerical examples to demonstrate the feasibility of the PTC method. The first two examples involve a 145-bus system where the QSS model met numerical difficulties, and the PTC method was able to provide correct approximations and faster simulation speed. The third example involves a 14-bus system that was long-term unstable, and the PTC method was able to capture the instabilities of the long-term stability model. The paper concludes that PTC can serve as an alternative method in power system long-term stability analysis.",1
155,"1. The study of anisotropic quantum scattering in two spatial dimensions (2d) has gained significant interest due to the potential for creating exotic and highly correlated quantum systems with dipolar gases. This includes phenomena such as anisotropic superfluidity, 2d dipolar fermions, and few-body dipolar complexes.
2. The recent production of ultracold polar molecules in optical traps has made it possible to realize these phenomena. There is also a long history of research on 2d quantum effects in condensed matter physics, including superfluid films, high-temperature superconductivity, 2d materials like graphene, and possibilities for topological quantum computation.
3. The development of experimental techniques for creating quasi-2d Bose and Fermi ultracold gases has provided unique opportunities for modeling these 2d effects in a highly controlled environment.
4. The anisotropy and long-range character of the dipole-dipole interaction in 2d systems presents challenges for traditional partial-wave analysis, as different partial waves become strongly coupled in the asymptotic region.
5. Recent progress has been made in the analysis of 2d and quasi-2d scattering of dipoles, including the study of 2d dipolar scattering in the threshold and semiclassical regimes with the dipole polarization directed orthogonally to the scattering plane.
6. The text describes a method for quantitative analysis of 2d quantum scattering on a long-range strongly anisotropic scatterer, which permits the description of 2d collisions of unpolarized dipoles. The method is based on the few-dimensional scattering method and has been applied to the dipole-dipole scattering induced by an elliptically polarized laser field in 3d free space.",0
156,"• G65.2-0.5, also known as G65.3+5.7, was identified as a supernova remnant (SNR) and initially observed in the 1970s and 1980s, but was then largely ignored until recently.
• New interest in the remnant is due to its potential to explain an unusual class of SNRs called thermal composite SNRs (or mixed morphology SNRs), which have a shell-like radio continuum morphology and a centrally-bright X-ray morphology caused by thermal, rather than synchrotron, processes.
• G65.2-0.5 is now classified as a thermal composite SNR because it meets the three requirements for this classification: it has a shell-like radio continuum morphology, emits thermal X-rays, and has a centrally filled X-ray morphology.
• The remnant's age has been estimated to be around 30,000 years, and it is located about 900 parsecs above the galactic plane. Its X-ray luminosity is lower than that of the archetypical thermal composite SNR, W44, due to a lower electron density.
• The remnant's membership in the thermal composite class is supported by optical and X-ray observations, as well as the absence of a bright pulsar at the location of the observed bright spot in the X-ray image. The remnant's evolutionary stage and potential interaction with molecular clouds are still being studied.",1
157,"1. Permutations are a basic building block for encoding various data structures such as integer functions, strings, and binary relations. A permutation of n integers can be represented in n log n bits, which is close to the information theory lower bound of n log n - log n bits.
2. Efficient computation of both the permutation and its inverse is often required in many applications. The lower bound of n log n - log n bits yields a lower bound of n comparisons to sort such a permutation in the comparison model.
3. Various sorting algorithms have been developed to take advantage of specificities of each permutation to sort more efficiently than the lower bound. These algorithms can be used to create encoding schemes for permutations.
4. Compression schemes for permutations do not necessarily support the inverse of the permutation or the application of the permutation in reasonable time.
5. The entropy of a sequence of positive integers adding up to n is n log n - log n. Succinct encodings of sequences can be used to represent sequences efficiently.
6. Bitmaps are a special case of sequences where the alphabet is binary. Raman et al. devised a bitmap representation that takes n H0 bits, where H0 is the zero-order entropy of the bitmap, while maintaining constant time for operations.
7. Grossi et al. extended the result to larger alphabets using the wavelet tree, which decomposes a sequence into several bitmaps. By representing those bitmaps in plain form, one can represent a sequence using n Hk bits of space, where Hk is the k-th order entropy of the sequence.
8. Estivil-Castro and Wood list various measures of disorder in permutations, such as the number of pairs in the wrong order, the number of ascending substrings, and the number of elements that need to be removed to leave a sorted list.
9. A down step of a permutation is a position where an element is followed by a smaller one. A run in a permutation is a maximal range of consecutive positions that does not contain any down step. There is an encoding scheme using at most n log n bits to encode a permutation covered by r runs of lengths l1, ..., r, which supports access to the r runs and their inverses in O(log n) time.",0

2. * Experimental evidence of chimera states has been found in chemical oscillators and optical coupled-map lattices, and they emerge naturally in mechanical experiments involving coupled metronomes. In neuroscience, chimera states are believed to explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep in birds and dolphins.
3. * In this paper, the authors identify various single and multi-chimera states in networks of non-locally coupled HR oscillators, both in 2D and 3D versions, and study the collective behavior of HR oscillators in relation to the values of network parameters.
4. * The study of chimera states in systems modeling neuron dynamics is significant and relevant for applications, as it verifies the existence of chimera states in coupled bistable elements and identifies a novel type of mixed oscillatory state (MOS) where desynchronized neurons are interspersed among those that are either stationary or oscillate in synchrony.",0
159,"1. Kauffman networks are disordered dynamical systems used to model genetic regulatory systems. They were studied using mean field theory and found to have a dynamical phase transition. The number of relevant elements in the network, which determine the attractors, was studied and found to have a probability distribution. These relevant elements can be subdivided into asymptotically non-communicating, independent modules. The scaling of the number of relevant elements with system size or as a percolation transition in the set of relevant elements can be used to describe the phase transition in random Boolean networks.
2. The annealed approximation, introduced by Derrida and Pomeau, was used to compute the properties of the attractors, but it was found to be reliable only in the chaotic phase and exact for a random map. The study of the relevant elements is complementary to this approach and can be used to develop a new approximation scheme that works better in the frozen phase and on the critical line. This region is the most interesting because it reproduces some features of real cells and is the least understood. The distribution of the number of relevant elements and its connection with the properties of the attractors in the chaotic phase and on the critical line were also studied.",0

Turbulence in these systems is characterized by the presence of quantized vortices with quantized circulation, which form tangles and are more obvious than in classical turbulence.
2. The text also discusses the emergence of a new trend in turbulence study in multi-component BECs, which have characteristic features such as the presence of a (quasi) spin field. This allows for the possibility of novel turbulence, where both the velocity and spin fields are disturbed and various topological excitations are generated.
3. The text presents a study of turbulence in a spin-1 ferromagnetic spinor BEC, which is a typical multi-component BEC. The study focuses on the spectrum of the superflow kinetic energy and finds a Kolmogorov spectrum through the interaction between the spin and velocity fields. This spectrum is considered to be related to the vortex dynamics and is significant for understanding the turbulence addressed in the study.
4. The study also considers the possibility of a Kolmogorov spectrum in spin-superflow turbulence (SST) with hydrodynamic equations obtained from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The analysis is based on the approximations that the macroscopic wave functions are expressed by the fully magnetized state, the total density is almost uniform, and the magnitude of velocity is much smaller than the density sound velocity. The study finds that the velocity field satisfies a Kolmogorov spectrum with a non-dimensional coefficient, and the spectrum of the kinetic energy can obey the Kolmogorov spectrum.",0
161,"1. Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) are thought to have low accretion rates onto supermassive black holes, and are often explained by the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model rather than the standard disc model.
2. The ADAF model predicts a ""submillimeter bump"" in the spectral energy distribution (SED) and a high brightness temperature in radio bands, making future very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments promising for imaging accretion discs.
3. However, there is a gap between observations and the ADAF spectrum at low-frequency radio bands, indicating the existence of additional unknown emission that may be buried under the accretion disc emission.
4. About half of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs, and at least 25% of transition objects, have a compact radio core with nearly flat spectra in 0.5-arcsec resolution, suggesting jet domination.
5. Millimeter continuum observations of 16 LLAGNs using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA) revealed that at least half of the sources show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz, and that the inverted spectra are not caused by resolution effects but intrinsic properties of the cores.
6. Submillimeter fluxes measured with the SCUBA on the JCMT may be from the dust associated with host galaxies, and can be useful to estimate dust contamination in the NMA measurements.
7. The millimeter survey and analyses of submillimeter archival data for the 20 VLBI-detected LLAGNs reveal high-frequency radio spectra of LLAGNs with compact cores, and suggest that relative radiative efficiencies between the jet and disc are determined by some kind of physical parameter(s) in the central engine.
8. The existence of the ADAF will give radio astronomers a chance to make the direct imaging for accretion discs, and the vsop-2, a next generation space VLBI mission currently being planned, will provide a 38 micro-arcsec resolution at 43 GHz and a brightness-temperature sensitivity of 10^8 K, which can reveal disc structures of more than a dozen nearby LLAGNs",0
162," • Scattering, absorption, and reradiation of photons by dust grains affect the propagation of starlight and play a key role in regulating the energy balance in the interstellar medium.
• The degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends on the wavelength of the incident radiation, and this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law (or reddening law).
• Galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior, with the ratio of total to selective extinction (R0) being a commonly used measure of the slope of the extinction/reddening law.
• The extinction law can vary depending on the environment, with different values of R0 found in dense molecular clouds, high-latitude cirrus clouds, and the direction of the galactic bulge.
• The scatter in the horizontal branch (HB) of the differentially-reddened globular cluster NGC 4833 is used to measure the angular power spectrum of dust on scales smaller than the angular resolution of thermal emission maps.
• Interstellar dust causes extinction and reddening of starlight, reprocesses the energy, and can confuse cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements. It is therefore important to quantify extinction/reddening variations on the smallest scales possible.
• The photometry of NGC 4833 is presented, and the construction of simulated cluster data sets is discussed. The methods for measuring the extinction law are outlined, and their application to NGC 4833 and simulated data sets is used to estimate the accuracy of each method. The angular power spectrum of cirrus in the direction of NGC 4833 is described, and possible future extensions of this work are discussed.",1
163,"1. Heavy fermion systems are characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales, with the Kondo scale marking the screening of local magnetic moments by conduction electrons. This screening is a many-body effect that entangles the spins of the conduction electrons and local moments. Below the coherence temperature, which tracks the Kondo scale, a paramagnetic heavy fermion liquid emerges, characterized by a large fermi surface with Luttinger volume including both the magnetic moments and conduction electrons. The coherence temperature of this metallic state is small, indicating a large effective mass.
2. The Kondo screening competes with the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which indirectly couples the local moments via the magnetic polarization of the conduction electrons. The competition between Kondo screening, which favors paramagnetic ground states, and the RKKY interaction, which favors magnetically ordered states, is at the heart of quantum phase transitions. Two radically different scenarios have been put forward to describe this quantum phase transition: the standard Hertz-Millis picture, in which the quasi-particles of the heavy-fermion liquid remain intact across the transition and undergo a spin-density wave transition, and alternative scenarios, in which the quantum critical point is linked to the very breakdown of the quasi-particle of the heavy-fermion state and a topological reorganization of the fermi surface across the transition is expected.
3. Recent experiments show that a change in fermi surface topology must not necessarily occur only at the magnetic order-disorder quantum critical point (QCP). In fact, even in YBa2Ru3Si2 it has been shown that the fermi surface reconstruction can be shifted to either side of the QCP via application of positive or negative chemical pressure. In this paper, the authors address these questions through an explicit calculation of the fermi surface topology in the framework of the Kondo lattice model (KLM).
4. The KLM describes an array of localized magnetic moments of spin, arising from atomic orbitals, that are coupled antiferromagnetically via the exchange interaction to a metallic host of mobile conduction electrons. The authors present detailed dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) calculations aimed at the investigation of the KLM ground state. They map out the magnetic phase diagram as a function",0
164,"1. The discovery of a resonance at 125 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a major step towards understanding the origin of mass of fundamental particles. This discovery may also affect the field of gravitation, particularly in models where the Higgs field has nonminimal coupling to the general relativity sector.
2. Nonminimal coupling between the Higgs and spacetime curvature may be beneficial for having the Higgs responsible for inflation and as a suppression mechanism for the contribution to dark energy expected from quantum fields.
3. Upper bounds on the gravitational interaction of Higgs bosons from LHC experiments have been discussed, and bounds on the crosstalk between the Higgs particle and gravity can also be obtained from strong-gravity astrophysical objects.
4. The presence of a strong spacetime curvature deforms the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, affecting the mass of fundamental particles such as the electron. However, nucleons are minimally affected by strong curvature.
5. Peculiar wavelength shifts are predicted for electronic transitions and are strongly suppressed for molecular transitions. Attention has been focused on the possibility of couplings to the only non-null curvature invariant, the Kretschmann invariant.
6. White dwarfs can be used to obtain limits on the coupling of the Higgs field to a specific curvature invariant by means of spectroscopic observations. A carbon-rich white dwarf, BPM 27606, has been studied using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT).
7. The search for coupling between the Higgs (or any scalar field permeating the whole universe) and spacetime curvature arises naturally within the framework of field theory in curved spacetime. The Lagrangian density for an interacting scalar field in a generic spacetime is given by equation (ef{eq:lagrangian}), where the coupling constant between the Higgs field and the Ricci scalar is a free parameter.
8. The mass of fundamental fermions, such as the electron, is changed proportionally to the Higgs vacuum expectation value due to the presence of coupling of the Higgs field to space-time curvature. This implies that all molecular transitions only depending on the nuclei mass should be unaffected by the Higgs-curvature coupling at leading order.",0

166,"1. The interstellar medium (ISM) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into distinct phases: hot ionized gas, warm neutral medium, and cold neutral medium. Star formation is restricted to cold dense gas and is strongly correlated with the molecular gas content. However, the presence of molecules may not be the cause of star formation but rather a marker of the right conditions for gravitational collapse. Understanding the links between star formation, the ISM, and galaxy evolution is crucial, and identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold, molecular gas is able to develop is key.
2. The gas temperature sets the characteristic size and mass of prestellar cores in post-shock regions within magnetized, star-forming clouds. Tracking molecular chemistry is crucial to accurately represent small-scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star-forming clouds. Molecular gas is found predominantly in dense, cold regions where dust shielding and self-shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field intensity. The transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas, called photodissociation regions (PDRs), have been studied extensively, and their structure is determined by a variety of non-linear, coupled processes in the ISM. Implementing these processes in a numerical simulation is highly non-trivial, and three-dimensional simulations of finite, but representative, portions of galactic disks have attempted to replicate a supernova-driven ISM, with varying degrees of success. However, studies on the atomic-to-molecular transition within large-scale, three-dimensional simulations have received less attention.",0

- The discovery of an overdensity of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been interpreted as an intervening population of stars at a certain distance that may represent a dwarf galaxy or tidal debris. This overdensity, labeled the VRC, has been analyzed and found to be a massive foreground population with about 5% of the angular surface density of the LMC itself. This conclusion, if true, would have profound consequences for the interpretation of galactic microlensing studies, as this stellar foreground population could be responsible for a significant fraction of the microlensing signal toward the LMC.
- However, this explanation for the LMC microlensing optical depth has been challenged on several grounds. The MACHOTEAM has found no evidence for a foreground population at a certain distance in their extensive photometric database, and the feature found by MACHOTEAM is unlikely to be the VRC. Gould (1997) has argued that any luminous foreground population would have to meet certain criteria in order to be consistent with surface photometry of the LMC. Johnston (1998) has analyzed the ZHAO (1998) proposition and concluded that an ad hoc tidal streamer to explain the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC would cause unobserved overdensities or require precise alignment with the LMC.

4. A Banach space is uniformly convex if given any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if ||x|| = ||y|| = 1 and ||x - y|| > ε, then ||(x + y) / 2|| < 1 - δ. Kim and Lee gave a characterization for uniformly convex Banach spaces in terms of the BPBp in 2014.",0
170,"1. The text discusses the importance of accurately modeling neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections for the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments. The contribution of multi-nucleon events, specifically two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations, is essential for a proper description of data at typical neutrino energies of a few GeV. The authors present a fast and efficient method for calculating inclusive 2p-2h responses in the relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG) using the frozen nucleon approximation. This method reduces the number of nested integrals needed to evaluate the inclusive 2p-2h electroweak responses from 7 to 1, making it well-suited for computing neutrino cross sections folded with the neutrino flux.
2. The frozen nucleon approximation is validated by comparing the calculated 2p-2h response functions with exact results. The authors find that the frozen approximation works properly for computing the phase space function for two-particle emission in the range of momentum transfers of interest for neutrino experiments with accelerators. However, the presence of virtual delta excitations requires the introduction of a ""frozen"" propagator, which is an average over the Fermi sea. The frozen approximation becomes more accurate as the momentum transfer increases and can be used to implement 2p-2h models in Monte Carlo codes currently available.",0
171,"1. The reverberation mapping technique is used to estimate the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by measuring the time lag between variations in the continuum emission and the broad emission lines. This time lag is interpreted as the light travel time across the broad line region (BLR). The size of the BLR can then be used, along with the velocity dispersion of the broad emission lines and the assumption of virial equilibrium, to estimate the mass of the SMBH.
2. The reverberation mapping technique has been used to estimate the SMBH masses in a limited number of AGNs, as the technique is observationally taxing and demands a large amount of telescope time. However, a correlation has been found between the BLR size and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100 Å, which can be used to estimate SMBH masses from single-epoch spectra and calibrate other surrogate relations used for black hole mass estimates. This correlation is useful for low luminosity AGNs, as the time lag between the variations of the broad line and the continuum is expected to be of the order of hours to days, compared to several months for high luminosity sources. Therefore, monitoring programs of short durations but fast sampling are required to estimate the reverberation time lags for low luminosity AGNs.",0
172,"1. Broad emission iron lines are common features in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries, and are thought to originate near the black hole due to radiation being reflected off the accretion disc.
2. The spin of the black hole affects the shape of the iron line, with a higher spin value resulting in the innermost stable orbit being closer to the black hole. This inner edge of the accretion disc is often used to estimate the spin value.
3. The Laor model is a widely used model for relativistic disc spectral lines, but it assumes a maximally rotating Kerr black hole and does not allow for the spin value to be fitted. Other numerical codes have been developed with similar functionality.
4. The Laor model can still be used to estimate the spin value by identifying the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit, but it tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution.
5. The text compares the Laor model to another relativistic model, and finds that the Laor model tends to overestimate the spin value and has insufficient energy resolution, particularly for lower spin values.
6. The text also discusses the importance of correctly re-binning data with respect to the instrumental energy resolution in order to obtain statistically relevant results.",0

The text discusses the use of the ""displace, cut and reflect"" method to generate axially symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations, which can be used to model galaxies or accretion disks. These solutions can be static or stationary, and can include radial pressure, radial tension, electric fields, and magnetic fields.
2. The method is applied to spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's field equations in isotropic coordinates to generate static disks made of a perfect fluid, i.e. with radial pressure equal to tangential pressure. This results in disks with well-behaved density and pressure.
3. The article also explores the generation of disks with halos using different known exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for static spheres of perfect fluid in isotropic coordinates.
4. The article concludes with a discussion of the results, noting that the disks generated using this method have positive surface energy density and equal radial and azimuthal pressures, making them potentially useful for modeling realistic galaxies.",0

2. The breakdown of an external symmetry is not dangerous, while the breakdown of an internal symmetry leads to inconsistencies in the quantum theory.

The STE-Quest mission is a medium-sized candidate for launch in 2022/2024 by the European Space Agency to test Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) by measuring the gravitational red-shift and testing the universality of free fall with a space-clock comparison and atom interferometer. The mission aims to find possible deviations from predictions of General Relativity (GR) and is a complex mission comprising a space and ground segment.
2. The STE-Quest payload primarily consists of two instruments, the atomic clock and the atom interferometer, and equipment for the science links and precise orbit determination. The atomic clock is a rebuilt of the high-precision PHARAO clock used in the ACES mission with an optically derived microwave signal for short-term stability. The atom interferometer uses interference between matter waves to generate an interference pattern that depends on the external forces acting on the atoms under test. The science links comprise optical and microwave time & frequency links to compare the on-board clock with distributed ground clocks and allow to compare distant ground clocks to one another using the on-board segment as a relay.",0

178,"1. The Mott-Hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid-Mott insulator transitions in various systems, including Josephson arrays and granular superconductors. Recently, the transition has been observed and studied in a system of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. The possibility to manipulate and test the many-body behavior of a system of trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice has attracted significant theoretical and experimental interest, with potential applications in quantum computation.
2. The short-range correlations not included in the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz are studied using perturbation theory to find corrections to the short-range behavior of the one-particle density matrix. These corrections are relevant for experimentally observed expansion patterns, which are important for determining the location of the insulator-superfluid transition.
3. The cold bosonic gas in the optical lattice can be described by a bosonic Mott-Hubbard model, which is studied using various approximation schemes, including the Gutzwiller mean-field ansatz, density-matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo.
4. The perturbative approach used in the insulating state is identical to the one in [xcite], although the goal was different, focusing on studying corrections to the phase diagram. The article is organized into sections that introduce the model and its mean-field solution, outline the general perturbative approach, present and discuss numerical results, and discuss implications for expansion patterns in both bulk systems and a harmonic confining potential.",0

2. * A dynamical model called MAVANs proposes that relic neutrinos could form a negative pressure fluid and cause cosmic acceleration through an unknown scalar field called the ""acceleron.""
3. * In this model, the neutrino mass depends on its number density and changes with the evolution of the universe, affecting the equation of state parameter and dark energy density.

182,"1. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons are mostly liberated from hadrons. Its phase transition structure is a central aim of research in hot and/or dense QCD, with ongoing experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The QGP can also be found in the early universe and the cores of super-dense stars.
2. The text discusses a calculation of the QGP thermodynamic properties using the one gluon exchange (OGE) scheme in the Landau Fermi liquid theory framework. The calculation is a generalization of a previous work, taking into account weakly interacting quarks, finite temperature, and baryon density. The OGE scheme is used to evaluate the potential energy of the QGP in the Fermi liquid model.
3. The calculation results in a phase diagram showing the critical temperature and baryon density for the QGP phase transition. The one gluon exchange interaction causes the QGP to form at smaller baryon densities and temperatures compared to the lattice QCD predictions. The hadronic pressure is also taken into account, showing a forbidden region for certain bag pressure values and zero baryonic chemical potential.
4. The text also discusses the effect of the one gluon exchange interaction on the phase diagram of the QGP with massless quarks, causing the system to reach the deconfined phase at smaller baryon densities and temperatures. The results depend on the bag pressure and the QCD coupling constant values. Future work includes adjusting the phase diagram for the relation between the bag constant and the QCD coupling constant, generalizing the method for non-constant coupling and bag pressure, and adding gluon interactions to the present calculations.",0
183,"
- A conformally symmetric model for strong interactions at low energies was proposed in ref. [xcite], based on the observation that the dynamical equations of gauge theories retain their flat-space-time form when subject to a conformally-flat metrical field. The model describes quarks and gluons as oscillating with a universal frequency inside a closed universe (AdS universe), and photons as freely traveling through flat space-time.
- The model comprises one real scalar field and one complex scalar field. A solution for the real scalar field leads to AdS confinement, via the associated conformally flat metric. Under a certain condition, one obtains a light scalar field associated with confinement and a very heavy complex scalar field associated with electromagnetism.
- An apparent interference effect was observed around the √s = 2.55 GeV threshold in the invariant-mass distribution of ϒ(2S) events, which could be due to interference between the typical oscillation frequency of 190 MeV of the ϒ(2S) pair and that of the gluon cloud. This effect might be explained by scalar glueball exchange between the quarks, which interferes with the natural quark oscillations. The scalar glueball could be just a light scalar glueball, albeit much lighter than found in previous refs. It may decay into photons via virtual quark loops, and through photons into e+e− pairs, but the probability for such reactions to occur is extremely remote.",0
184,"1. The term ""stochastic resonance"" was introduced in the 1980s to describe the effect of nonmonotone dependence of a system's response on noise, particularly in the study of periodic advance of glaciers on earth.
2. Stochastic resonance is the phenomenon where the transmission of a signal can be improved by the addition of noise. This is because the perturbed signal may be observable and inference can be done on the signal, even if the original signal is not observable due to being below a certain threshold.
3. The optimal level of noise, at which the signal can be best estimated, is called stochastic resonance. This level can be determined using statistical quantities such as the Shannon mutual information, Kullback divergence, or the Fisher information quantity.
4. The paper discusses the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for a model with a threshold and a subthreshold constant and non-negative signal, which is perturbed by adding a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process. The paper proposes two schemes of observations: observing the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold, and measuring the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold.
5. The paper proposes two different estimators for the schemes and studies their asymptotic properties. It also notes the presence of stochastic resonance in the context of hypotheses testing, where the overall probability of error is nonmonotonic dependent on the noise level.
6. The paper establishes asymptotic properties of estimators given by the generalized method of moments for two models, and gives an example of stochastic resonance based on a process where the phenomenon appears pronounced.
7. The paper also discusses the use of ergodic diffusions as noise in the problem of stochastic resonance, and notes that characterizations of classes of ergodic process that enhance the stochastic resonance can be done but not in a simple way. The paper also notes that the analysis of the overall probability of error seems to put in evidence something new with respect to the current literature.",0
185,"1. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have been found to have mainly d-wave pairing symmetry, with a predominant d-gap symmetry up to the superconducting critical temperature. This symmetry has been determined through try-crystal phase-sensitive measurements and thermal transport measurements. However, above a certain temperature (~7K), there is no direct evidence for this type of symmetry from thermal conductivity measurements.
2. The symmetry of the order parameter and the effect of pinning of vortices play a crucial role in determining the correct angle pattern in thermal conductivity measurements. A field-cooled procedure is used to rule out the influence of pinning of vortices, which is affected by the distribution of oxygen vacancies, defects, and impurity centers.

187,"1. * Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models have attractive properties such as calculable soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms and renormalization group invariant soft terms, but they suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass-squared parameters leading to tachyonic states.
2. * The original solution to this problem is to add a universal scalar mass to the AMSB soft SUSY breaking terms, resulting in the ""minimal"" AMSB (mAMSB) model with a parameter space of m0, m3/2, and sign(μ).
3. * An alternative setup for AMSB is hypercharged anomaly mediation (HCAMSB), a string-motivated scenario with SUSY breaking localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region, leading to anomaly mediation becoming the dominant source of SUSY breaking in the visible sector.
4. * The bino mass in the mSSM can be the only soft SUSY breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation, leading to a small or large perturbation to the spectrum depending on its size.
5. * The combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation can lead to phenomenologically viable spectra for a wide range of relative contributions, addressing the shortcomings of each other's models.
6. * The hCAMSB model should be easily distinguishable from the mAMSB model at the LHC if m6 is not too large, due to the presence of chargino candidates in cascade decay events.

189,"1. The convection-diffusion model is a partial differential equation that has been used to describe various phenomena in science and engineering. It can be expressed as a semi-linear parabolic PDE and can be solved numerically using various techniques such as finite element method, lattice boltzmann method, finite-difference scheme, and higher-order compact finite difference schemes.
2. Researchers have developed various numerical schemes to solve the convection-diffusion equation, including a nine-point high-order compact implicit scheme proposed by Noye and Tan, and a fourth-order compact finite difference unconditionally stable scheme by Dehghan and Mohebbi. These schemes have different levels of accuracy and stability.
3. The text also discusses the use of the differential quadrature method (DQM) to solve the convection-diffusion equation. The DQM is an approximation to derivatives of a function that is the weighted sum of the functional values at certain nodes. The weighting coefficients depend only on the grids, which is why a uniform partition in each direction is used. The text also discusses the use of modified cubic b-splines as base functions in the DQM.",0
190,"• The text discusses the use of bolometer arrays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths to detect dusty objects at extreme redshifts, which may be missed in surveys at other wavelengths due to obscuration and unfavorable correction factors. The discovery of ""SCUBA galaxies"" in the late 1990s led to a shift away from optocentric views of galaxy formation and evolution. However, efforts to study these galaxies in detail were initially met with pessimism due to the lack of plausible optical counterparts.

• Recent progress in the study of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) has been made through radio imaging of survey fields, which has allowed for the detection and identification of a diverse population of SMGs. These galaxies have been found to have a range of properties, including some with broad lines and X-ray detections, morphologically complex galaxies, extremely red galaxies, and galaxies with obscured active nuclei and/or superwinds. Spectroscopic redshifts for these galaxies have been difficult to determine, but accurate redshifts reported by Chapman et al. (2003, 2005) have facilitated measurements of molecular gas mass and constraints on gas reservoir size and dynamical mass. These data suggest that SMGs are massive systems and provide some of the strongest tests of galaxy formation models to date. However, a detailed understanding of SMGs remains a distant goal, and confusion and selection biases may have skewed our understanding of this population.",1
191," * The text discusses the use of multi-object spectrographs on 4m-class telescopes to construct large samples of faint galaxies with measured redshifts, which allows for the computation of the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies as a function of redshift and the observation of the evolution of the galaxy population. Several deep, faint galaxy redshift surveys have been conducted and the results show that the population of blue, star-forming galaxies has evolved strongly since z~1, while the population of red galaxies shows at most modest signs of evolution. However, there are differences in the LFs derived from these surveys due to various selection effects and systematic errors.
* The text also discusses the evolution and environmental dependence of the galaxy LF based on data obtained during the course of a redshift survey of the Corona Borealis Supercluster. The survey resulted in over 400 redshifts in the Corona Borealis Supercluster and roughly 300 in a background supercluster. The LF analysis is limited to galaxies with R<17.77 and the survey data is used to compute the LF for both field galaxies and for the two superclusters individually. The results are discussed in the context of previous work and the Hubble constant and deceleration parameter are used to compare to the most recent work in the field.",1
192,"1. Rapidity gaps, regions without hadronic activity in collisions, have been observed in hadronic collisions at HERA and the Tevatron, and are attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons.
2. At the Tevatron, a fraction of dijet events exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets, indicating that color singlet exchange effects in QCD events are relevant at high momentum transfers.
3. Bjorken predicted a gap fraction of order one percent, in terms of a fraction of dijet events due to color-singlet exchange and a survival probability of rapidity gaps.
4. The two-gluon exchange model, with the two-gluon exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part, is used to calculate the color singlet fraction.
5. The color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons, leading to a decrease in the observable gap fraction as the contribution from gluon-induced dijet events is reduced.
6. Recent measurements by the CDF and D0 collaborations show no such effect, and the D0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet transverse momentum.
7. The two-gluon exchange model has limitations and the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction is essentially nonperturbative, but within an unitarized model, non-perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters, the survival probability of gaps and a universal Coulomb phase shift.",0

194,"1. LMCX-2 is a persistent LMXB (Low Mass X-ray Binary) with a neutron star primary and a low mass secondary star. The secondary is transferring mass to the primary via Roche-lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk that produces X-rays.
2. Most persistently bright LMXBs are neutron star systems, which can be divided into two groups: Z sources and Atoll sources. Z sources are usually the brightest in X-rays and have higher accretion rates, while Atoll sources have lower accretion rates and show fragmented island-like regions in their color-color diagrams.
3. The main physical difference between Z sources and Atoll sources is thought to be the strength of the neutron star magnetic field and their evolutionary history.
4. LMCX-2 is a Z source and has an accretion rate around the Eddington limit, making it one of the most X-ray luminous LMXBs known. However, due to its extra-galactic nature, its X-ray flux is rather low.
5. The system parameters of LMCX-2, such as the orbital period, are not well constrained. Estimates for the orbital period range from 6.4 hours to 12 days, and no periodic variability was detected in 6 years of MACHO data.
6. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, narrow emission lines have been detected in other LMXBs, such as SCOX-1 and X1822-371, which are interpreted as coming from the irradiated side of the donor star.
7. The authors applied the technique of Bowen fluorescence to LMCX-2 and detected a periodic signal in their spectroscopic dataset, which they identify as the orbital period. They also detected narrow emission lines in the Bowen region, which they identify as coming from the irradiated side of the companion, giving the first ever constraints on the system parameters of LMCX-2.
8. The authors created average spectra for each individual night and normalized the continuum flux to one by dividing each average spectrum by a low order spline fit. They found that both spectra are dominated by the very narrow high excitation HeII 4686 emission line, while Bowen emission is present",0
195,"1. The axial anomaly, a fundamental issue in quantum field theory, has been analyzed using the renormalization procedure and the path integral formalism. An alternative approach by Dolgov and Zakharov interprets the anomaly as an infrared phenomenon, originating from a singularity in the chiral limit of the triangular diagram's absorbitive part. This infrared interpretation complements the more familiar ultraviolet interpretation from the renormalization procedure.
2. The Dolgov and Zakharov approach has been related to specific effects in physical reactions, such as polarized radiative decays of particles. The axial anomaly plays an essential role in interpreting spin-dependent parton distribution and can be connected to polarized radiative decays. The corresponding decay rates for definite helicity states have been calculated, and the structure of mass singularities and their cancellation has been examined.
3. The paper discusses the kinoshita-lee-nauenberg (KLN) theorem and its application to the axial anomaly. The theorem is crucial for understanding the cancellation of mass singularities in polarized processes. The authors also highlight the non-smooth behavior of the axial anomaly in the chiral limit and its manifestation in helicity changing processes.
4. The authors extend the Dolgov and Zakharov approach to the study of the radiative pion decay, calculating the differential decay rate for the process with an outgoing lepton undergoing an helicity flip. They also study the behavior of the inner bremsstrahlung contribution to the pion decay rate in the collinear and infrared limits, considering separate cases for right-handed and left-handed outgoing leptons. The mass singularities cancellation mechanism is found to occur differently based on the polarization of the outgoing lepton.",0

• The goal of salient object detection is to select the most significant object in a scene, which has various applications such as recognition, image and video compression, video summarization, media re-targeting and photo collage, image quality assessment, image segmentation, content-based image retrieval and image collection browsing, image editing and manipulating, visual tracking, object discovery, and human-robot interaction.
• A large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years, and they involve two main steps: selecting objects to process and segmenting the object area.
• Models have bypassed the first challenge by focusing on scenes with single objects, and they perform well on the second step, as shown by high performances on existing biased datasets.
• However, it is unclear how current models perform on complex cluttered scenes with several objects, and there is a lack of suitable benchmark datasets and a widely-agreed objective definition of the most salient object.

2. * The maps associated with cobordisms can be used to detect exotic smooth structures on 4-manifolds with boundary.
3. * A key example is the nucleus of an elliptic surface, which can be shown to be homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to another 4-manifold using the Heegaard Floer invariants.
4. * The original definitions of the vector spaces and maps in Heegaard Floer theory involved counting pseudoholomorphic disks and triangles in symmetric products of Riemann surfaces, with the Riemann surfaces related to the 3-manifolds and cobordisms via Heegaard diagrams.
5. * Sarkar and the third author showed that every 3-manifold admits a Heegaard diagram that is nice in the sense that the curves split the diagram into elementary domains, all but one of which are bigons or rectangles.
6. * This allows for a combinatorial description of the Heegaard Floer homology of any 3-manifold and the hat version of Heegaard Floer homology of null homologous knots and links in any 3-manifold.
7. * The goal of the paper is to give a combinatorial procedure for calculating the ranks of the maps associated with cobordisms between 3-manifolds with the property that the induced maps are surjective.
8. * This case includes all cobordisms for which the first homology is torsion, as well as all those consisting of only 2-handle additions.",0
198,"1. * The paper extends the results of Yetter, Gerstenhaber, and Gerstenhaber and Schack on the deformation theory of associative algebras and poset-indexed diagrams of associative algebras to a deformation theory for arbitrary pasting diagrams of categories, functors, and natural transformations.
2. * The paper establishes that obstructions are cocycles for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general, and considers deformations of pasting diagrams in which specified functors or natural transformations are required to be deformed trivially.
3. * The paper makes explicit a point overlooked in previous theorems: the cochain maps constructed in those theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimensional compositions in the pasting diagram. However, the cochain maps are independent of those choices up to algebraic homotopy, and thus the isomorphism type of the deformation complex for a pasting diagram is well-defined in either the homotopy category or derived category of cochain complexes over a ring.
4. * The paper uses the cochain maps of the previous section to give explicit examples of deformation complexes associated to various shapes of commutative pasting diagrams. It also shows that cochain maps induced by two different associations of the 2-dimensional composition are not actually equal, but only chain homotopic.
5. * The paper begins with the simplest example, a ""commutative pillow with triangular cross-section,"" and then considers more complex examples involving 1-dimensional composition. It also discusses the relationship between the deformation complex and the (dual) mapping cylinder of a chain map between mapping cones.",0
199," * The text discusses the importance of understanding the physical picture behind observable phenomena in physics, and the need to select essential degrees of freedom in complex theories.
* An example is given of crystals, where the fundamental degrees of freedom are ions, electrons, and the electromagnetic field, but in order to understand electric conductivity and heat capacity, it is more useful to work with ""heavy electrons"" with dynamical mass, phonons, and their interaction.
* The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is identified as the most important QCD phenomenon for understanding the low-energy properties of nucleons and their low mass.
* In the low-energy regime, light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks which interact by the exchange of Goldstone bosons (pseudoscalar mesons), vector and scalar mesons, and are subject to confinement.
* The symmetry structure of the dominant 6q configuration in the nucleon overlap region induces an additional effective repulsion, related to the ""Pauli forbidden state"", and the s-wave relative motion wave function has a node at short range.",1
200," • The text describes a calcium phosphate-coated implantable medical device that minimizes immune response and stores and releases one or more medicinally active agents.
• Cardiovascular stents, used to enlarge coronary arteries, often cause inflammatory restenosis, leading to re-narrowing of the vessel and requiring repeat surgical treatment.
• The immune response is triggered by damage to the vessel lining during surgical procedure, which can be minimized through surface modifications to implanted medical devices.
• Polymer film coatings are commonly used for surface modification, but even biodegradable polymers can cause inflammatory response and may be quickly depleted, leading to exposure of the bare metal surface and further inflammation.
• The text suggests the use of calcium phosphate materials, which are fully bio-compatible and bio-resorbable, for coating implantable medical devices.
• Hydroxyapatite ceramics, a member of the calcium phosphate family, have been used for biomedical applications, including matrices for drug release control.
• The use of calcium phosphate coatings, including HA coatings, has been limited by their brittle behavior and thickness. However, HA coatings have shown excellent biocompatibility and provide accelerated integration of the implant with the surrounding tissue.
• The bio-resorption rate of such coatings can be controlled through adjustment of their crystallinity and chemical composition.

201," * The text describes a nerve guidance conduit (NGC) for nerve repair and regeneration. The NGC is made of a porous polymeric sheet with aligned nanofibers and an outer fibrous tube. The NGC is designed to improve mechanical strength, facilitate cell migration and directional axonal regeneration, and prevent infiltration of scar tissue.
* The NGC is fabricated using a combination of the solvent evaporation method and the salt-leaching method. A PCL solution is poured onto a petri dish and acupuncture needles are placed on top to form multi-channels. The dish is then moved to a hood to let it air dry. After the PCL sheet is formed, it is immersed in deionized water to dissolve the salt and produce pores. The needles are removed, leaving multi-channels on the PCL sheet. The sheet is then cut into a rectangular shape and wound in a spiral fashion to form the NGC.
* The NGC has a spiral structure with surface channels that increase the surface area available for cell migration and attachment. The aligned set of electrospun fibers in the surface channels ensures that the regenerating nerve will come into contact with aligned fibers. The chambers at the proximal and distal ends of the conduit allow for nerve stumps to be sutured without tension.
* The NGC is tunable such that its length and diameter can be varied depending on how it is to be used. The length and the outer diameter of the conduit depend on the size of its intermediate sheet, which is the spiral structured porous layer of the NGC. The method of fabricating the conduit does not limit its length, thus enabling the application for longer gap repair/regeneration for PNI.",1

- The invention relates to methods and apparatus for providing ventilatory assistance matched to a subject's respiratory need, suitable for spontaneously or non-spontaneously breathing subjects requiring long-term assistance, particularly during sleep.
- Current ventilatory devices do not accurately match the amplitude and phase of mask pressure to the subject's spontaneous efforts, leading to discomfort or panic. Larger amounts of asynchrony reduce the efficiency of the device.
- During sleep, there are changes in the neural control of breathing and the mechanics of the subject's airways, respiratory muscles, and chest wall, leading to a need for increased ventilatory support. Ideally, a ventilatory assistance device should match the phase and degree of assistance to the subject's spontaneous efforts, automatically adjust the degree of assistance to maintain at least a specified minimum ventilation, and continue to work correctly in the presence of large leaks.
- Most simple home ventilators either deliver a fixed volume or cycle between two fixed pressures, failing to meet the goal of adjusting the degree of assistance to maintain at least a given ventilation. They also largely fail to meet the goal of closely matching the subject's respiratory phase.
- Servo-ventilators measure ventilation and adjust the degree of assistance to maintain ventilation at or above a specified level but still fail to meet the goal of closely matching the phase of the subject's spontaneous efforts. Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) tailors the pressure vs time profile within a breath to unload the subject's resistive and elastic work, but it has disadvantages, such as overestimation of V(t) in the presence of leaks and reliance on the subject's chemoreceptor reflexes to monitor the composition of the arterial blood.
- The invention discloses a method for calculating the instantaneous phase in the respiratory cycle as a continuous variable, using identifiable features of a prototype flow-vs-time waveform and fuzzy logic to determine the phase.
- The method can be used to calculate respiratory airflow, average respiratory rate, and provide ventilatory assistance in a spontaneously breathing subject by ascribing a desired waveform template function, calculating the instantaneous phase, selecting a desired pressure modulation amplitude, and setting delivered pressure to the subject.",0

*- The text describes an invention for removing a gas (such as oxygen) from a liquid (such as water) using a mechanical, cylindrical gas scavenger machine that has a reduced height compared to a traditional stripping tower with a sump for chemical scavenger treatment. The machine includes a vessel with multiple partitions that divide the vessel into gasification chambers, each with a vapor space and an inlet for introducing the liquid. A mechanism ingests and mixes a second gas (such as nitrogen) into the liquid to displace the first gas and create a turbulent area. A vent in each chamber removes gas and liquid, and the outlet chamber may optionally function in secondary oxygen chemical scavenging.

*- The method involves introducing a continuous flow of liquid with a first gas into the inlet chamber, where it flows past partitions into the gasification chambers. A flow of second gas is introduced into the liquid by gas ingesting and mixing mechanisms, creating a turbulent area and allowing the second gas to physically displace the first gas. The first gas is forced out of the liquid as bubbles to the upper portion of the vessel where it collects in the respective vapor space of each chamber and is removed. The fluid, progressively more free of the first gas, underflows each partition and flows out of the vessel.

  * Magnetic field compensation systems are used in imaging systems with magnetic fields, such as scanning electron microscopes.
  * Compensation fields should be homogeneous if interfering fields are homogeneous, and pairs of Helmholtz coils are often used to generate homogeneous compensation fields.
  * A device for compensating magnetic fields is disclosed in U.S. Publication No 2005/019555A1, using three coil pairs and an analog controller.
  * Systems may also use only one coil per space axis for compensation, but the compensation region is smaller than with Helmholtz coils.
  * A single magnetic field sensor is typically used for measuring the magnetic field, but this does not allow for detecting homogeneity or inhomogeneity of the magnetic field.

• The invention is related to electron multipliers used in photomultipliers and particle detectors, specifically channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates.
• There are two types of conventional electron multipliers: discrete dynode multipliers and continuous electron multipliers.
• Discrete dynode multipliers consist of dynode stages that initiate and amplify a cascade of electrons, with each stage biased at a high negative voltage relative to the anode.
• The gain of a discrete dynode multiplier is given by the equation G D =γ I γ SE N−1, where γ SE is the average number of secondary electrons emitted by an electron from one dynode impacting on the next sequential dynode and N is the number of dynodes used in the detector.
• Continuous electron multipliers, such as channel electron multipliers and microchannel plates, employ one or more high resistivity glass channels or tubes, each of which acts as a series of continuous dynodes.
• The gain of a continuous electron multiplier can be modeled as a series of discrete dynodes and is given by the same equation as for discrete dynode multipliers.
• The foil electron multiplier, in accordance with the present invention, encompasses a next generation design of electron multipliers that uses a sequential series of thin foils in an evacuated enclosure to multiply electrons in a series of transmission stages.
• The gain of a foil electron multiplier is maximized by maximizing the electron transmission through the foil, maximizing the transmission through the support grid, and maximizing the secondary electron emission yield of the foil material.
• The gain advantage of the foil electron multiplier over conventional multipliers lies in the term γ SE +1, which represents the secondary electron yield from a primary electron exiting a foil and the continuation of the primary electron with the secondaries that it produces.",1

• Unlike prior inventions that used shutter glasses, the control for the viewing glasses in the 3-D Phenomenoscope is not a wired, wireless, or infrared signal, but information calculated in real-time from successive frames of the motion picture.
• The lenses of the viewing glasses may take 3 different states: clear-clear, clear-darkened, and darkened-clear.
• The viewing glasses are able to process successive digital images, identify lateral movement and synchronization events, and cause the lenses of the viewing glasses to assume the appropriate right-left lens states.
• The 3-D Phenomenoscope allows for older or motion pictures produced before the invention of the 3-D Phenomenoscope to be viewed with a 3-dimensional effect.
• The battery-powered viewer glasses are controlled in real-time by an intelligent processor packaged with the glasses, so 3-dimensional viewing works equally well whether the movie is viewed on a TV, DVD player, PC, or in a movie house.
• The 3-D Phenomenoscope is not limited to the Pulfrich effect and can be extended to other motion picture video effects that result from the processing of the motion picture images by a processor on the viewing glasses, and the resulting control of the viewing glasses lenses.",1

The anodized layer is sealed and overlaid with a porous vacuum deposition of nickel to form a second electrode. This sensing element is suitable for excitation by a ten Hertz sine wave alternating current electrical voltage and is used in a solid state electronic measurement circuit to measure relative humidity.
2. The manufacturing process for the sensing element includes anodizing the aluminum bore, depositing nickel particles in the anodized layer using vacuum deposition, sealing the anodized layer, and vacuum depositing a thin, water vapor pervious electrode over the nickel-impregnated sealed anodized layer. This process results in a sensor with a doped dielectric layer formed by the nickel impregnated sealed portion of the anodized layer, which is vapor pervious and electrically conductive.
3. The sensor functions by combining capacitance and resistance in a suitable manner such that its total impedance varies essentially linearly proportionally with the relative humidity. The impedance of the sensor changes almost instantly in response to relative humidity changes due to the thin and molecularly porous dielectric and second electrode. The sensor is self-contained and forms its own protection for the humidity-sensitive portion in its bore, while the surrounding atmosphere may circulate freely through the bore for free exchange of atmospheric molecules with the dielectric layer.",0

411,"• A Military Working Dog (MWD) is a canine trained to support military operations, including explosive and illegal narcotic detection, patrol, and tracking.
• Robby's Law, enacted in 2000, promotes the adoption of MWDs after their military service, giving first priority to former handlers, then to others capable of humanely caring for the MWD, and finally to law enforcement agencies.
• The Department of Defense (DOD) uses three systems to track different types of information about MWDs, including information related to their removal from service. These systems are WDMS, the Central Repository, and ROVR.
• Prevalent medical conditions among adopted MWDs include skin, dental, and musculoskeletal issues. The most common medical conditions are skin conditions or ear infections, dental disease or injury, arthritis or degenerative joint disease, and degenerative lumbo-sacral stenosis.
• Adopted MWDs need preventative care, including vaccinations, heartworm prevention, and dental cleanings. The average age of most MWDs at adoption is about 9 years old.
• Assistance with privately provided veterinary care is available through nonprofit organizations, such as the U.S. War Dogs Association and the American Humane organization. Owners of adopted MWDs may also purchase veterinary services through DOD if they have access to medical services at military installations.",1
412," * The Comanche helicopter program was established in 1983 to replace the Army's light helicopter fleet, with the goal of designing a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing armed reconnaissance and attack missions.
* The successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware, is critical to achieving these capabilities.
* In 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program to meet budgetary constraints, reducing funding and extending the development phase by 3 years. The restructure also called for two flyable prototypes to be produced and the production decision to be deferred.
* The Army proposed a program restructure that would allow it to acquire six additional aircraft within the Secretary's funding constraint by deferring developmental efforts to fiscal year 2002 and beyond. This restructuring continues risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and of higher program costs.
* Under the Army's restructured program, operational testing will not begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing the risks associated with the highly concurrent Comanche program. This approach may result in the need for significant and costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance, as seen with other aircraft systems such as the T-45A and C-17.
* The Comanche's performance and capability depend heavily on the development and integration of on-board, embedded computer systems, but software development problems, delays, and configuration management issues still exist. These issues, if not resolved, could degrade the aircraft's performance and capability and delay first flight.
* Maintainability requirements are important to achieving lower operating and support costs and wartime availability goals, but key maintainability requirements such as direct maintenance man-hours per flight hour, mean time to repair, and fault isolation may not be achievable. Failure to meet these parameters collectively could affect the ability of the Comanche to achieve lower operating and support cost and wartime availability objectives.",1

The program has options and waivers to increase access and reduce the reporting burden on working families while minimizing potential payment errors. FNS monitors program accountability through a quality control system that measures states' performance in accurately determining food stamp eligibility and calculating benefits.
2. *To be eligible for food stamp benefits, a household's gross income must not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level and the value of its assets must not exceed $2,000.* Recipients of TANF cash assistance are automatically eligible for food stamps, and states have the option to extend categorical eligibility to families receiving TANF-funded benefits or services. FNS offers options for states to allow households to own a vehicle worth more than the amount allowed in current regulations and remain eligible for food stamp benefits.
3. *States are penalized if their payment error rate is higher than the national average, which was 8.9 percent in fiscal year 2000.* Food stamp payment errors can be caused by inadvertent or intentional errors made by recipients and caseworkers. In fiscal year 2000, the states overpaid food stamp recipients about $976 million and underpaid recipients about $360 million. Almost all states used one or more options or waivers to change their food stamp eligibility determination process, with the primary reason being to increase access to food stamps.",0

However, there are concerns about HUD's capacity to manage such an increase due to ongoing organizational reform and potential lack of resources for new initiatives.
 * The budget proposal includes a large increase in the Section 8 housing assistance program, but there are concerns about the accuracy of HUD's budget proposals for this program. There are inconsistencies in past requests, and it is unclear whether the Department's budget request includes the use of unexpended project-based balances.
 * The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program provides communities with grants for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income people. However, there are concerns about the implementation and security of IDIS, the system used to monitor CDBG and other formula grant programs, and the potential impact on budget request offsets and unobligated balances.",0

  * The readiness mission provides medical services and support to the armed forces during contingency operations, while the benefits mission provides medical services and support to members of the armed forces, their family members, and others eligible for DOD health care.
  * DOD's health care mission is carried out through military treatment facilities and by civilian health care providers through TRICARE.
  * The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is responsible for ensuring the effective execution of DOD’s health care mission.
  * In 2009, DOD determined that consolidating the aging LRMC and 86th MDG clinic into one new facility would be more efficient and cost-effective than pursuing two separate renovation or reconstruction projects.
  * The replacement medical center will be operated and maintained by the Army, with the Air Force to provide clinical services that are currently offered at the 86th MDG clinic.
  * DOD used beneficiary population data as of March 2010 and data on historical patterns of patient migration to identify the areas served by the proposed replacement medical center.
  * DOD officials considered beneficiary population data, contingency operations, and changes or expected changes in troop strength known at the time when developing facility requirements for the replacement medical center.
  * However, more recent posture changes, announced in January 2012, are currently being assessed by military medical officials for their impact on the replacement medical center.
  * DOD has been reducing its military posture in Europe since German reunification in 1990, and today, LRMC is DOD’s only remaining tertiary care medical center in Europe.",0

3. ICE officers have discretion in various phases of the alien apprehension and removal process, with the most discretion in the initial phases of initiating removals, apprehending aliens, issuing removal documents, and detaining aliens.
4. Officers exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis, particularly for aliens with humanitarian issues and those not targeted by investigations, with guidance and approval from supervisors.
5. ICE guidance on the exercise of discretion during the alien apprehension and removal process is not comprehensive, and there is no mechanism to ensure that officers receive consistent information regarding legal developments.
6. ICE has updated some training for officers responsible for making alien apprehension and removal decisions, but more comprehensive guidance is needed to support officer decision making in cases involving humanitarian issues and aliens who are not primary targets of ICE investigations.
7. ICE officers rely on formal and on-the-job training, guidance from supervisors, and field operational manuals to inform their decision making regarding alien apprehensions and removals.
8. ICE has not completed efforts to provide officers with complete and up-to-date guidance to reflect expanded worksite and fugitive operations enforcement efforts, and there is no time frame for completing these revisions.",0

3. The Privacy Act of 1974 is the primary law governing the protection of personal privacy by federal agencies, regulating the collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of personal information.
4. SSA's disclosure policy has been revised to comply with about 25 statutes, including the Privacy Act, and places the burden on federal agencies to justify withholding information requested.
5. SSA's disclosure policy is more restrictive than most federal agencies and the Privacy Act, with specific conditions for disclosing information to law enforcement agencies.
6. SSA's disclosure policy allows for the sharing of nontax information with law enforcement under certain conditions, but only after considering factors such as the nature of the alleged criminal activity and the agency making the request.
7. SSA's disclosure policy is promulgated through regulations outlined in its ""Program Operations Manual System"" (POMS) and Emergency Messages, and is designed for implementation at all levels of the agency.

420," * The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) establishes a national policy for managing hazardous waste to minimize threats to human health and the environment.
* RCRA governs the management of hazardous waste from generation to final disposal and applies to waste from both current and past industrial operations.
* Waste associated with cleanups, often referred to as remediation waste, must be managed under RCRA if it contains a hazardous component.
* RCRA's requirements can negatively affect cleanups by increasing cost and time and leading parties to choose less aggressive remedies.
* The three most significant requirements under RCRA that unnecessarily add cost and time to some cleanups are land disposal restrictions, minimum technological requirements, and requirements for permits.
* Land disposal restrictions and minimum technological requirements primarily add costs by setting stringent standards for treating and disposing of hazardous waste.
* Requirements for permits can add time and costs to some cleanups.
* Exempting contaminated soil at a Superfund site from these requirements could reduce treatment costs by nearly 80 percent.
* Parties often choose less aggressive remedies, such as leaving remediation waste in place, to minimize or avoid RCRA's requirements.",1
421," • Before 1996, Medicare program integrity activities were underfunded and performed by insurance companies under contract with CMS, leading to reduced ability to conduct audits and review medical claims.
• HIPAA established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) in 1997, providing CMS with dedicated funding for program integrity activities, which increased about 63% from fiscal years 1997 through 2005. MIP funds are primarily allocated to support contractors' program integrity efforts for the traditional Medicare program.
• CMS generally spent the largest share of MIP funds on audit and medical review, while spending the smallest percentage on provider education. However, CMS's allocation approach does not take into account data on the effectiveness of one activity over the other or allow CMS to determine if activities are yielding benefits commensurate with the amounts spent.
• From fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2005, CMS increased the allocation for provider education by about 590%, due in part to CMS's decision to use MIP funds for outreach activities to groups of like providers. CMS plans to further increase expenditures for program integrity in fiscal year 2006, with an additional $112 million appropriated under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA).",1

* The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was signed into law in 2001, creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and giving it responsibility for securing all modes of transportation, including aviation. TSA oversees security operations at the nation's more than 450 commercial airports, including passenger and checked baggage screening operations.
* TSA has taken a number of actions to enhance the training of screeners and Screening Supervisors, but has encountered difficulties in providing access to recurrent training due to insufficient staffing and a lack of high-speed Internet/intranet connectivity at some training facilities.
* TSA has enhanced its basic screener training program and established a basic training program for screeners composed of a minimum of 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60 hours of on-the-job training. However, a recent study by the DHS OIG found that while incorporating standard operating procedures into the curricula was a positive step, a number of screener job tasks were incompletely addressed in or were absent from the basic training courses.

Ginnie Mae has several different products, including Ginnie Mae I, Ginnie Mae II, and Multiclass Securities Program, which offer varying levels of customization and risk for investors.
2. *Ginnie Mae's market share of new issuances has declined significantly over the past 20 years, from 42% in 1985 to 7% in 2004.* This decline is due to rapid growth in the conventional MBS market, as well as a decline in FHA and VA loan origination. Ginnie Mae's market share of outstanding MBS has also declined, from 54% in 1985 to 10% in 2004. Despite this, Ginnie Mae continues to finance the great majority of FHA and VA loans, and its securities represent roughly 90% of the market for FHA and VA loans.
3. *Ginnie Mae faces challenges in meeting the needs of its stakeholders, adequately disclosing loan information, working within its commitment authority, improving its data systems, and ensuring adequate capacity to plan, manage, and oversee contractors.* The agency has taken steps to address these challenges, such as expanding its product offerings, improving disclosure, and implementing measures to improve data systems and contract management.
4. *Ginnie Mae's outstanding volume of MBS has declined in recent years due to a decline in the outstanding volume of FHA and VA loans, as growing numbers of borrowers refinance in the conventional market.* This has led to a decline in the overall credit quality of FHA and VA loans, which could potentially raise the cost of servicing the government-backed loans in Ginnie Mae's pools and increase borrowers' interest rates.

The DNS is coordinated by a set of 13 root servers, and the U.S. government has played a significant role in its implementation and management. In 1998, the U.S. government announced its intention to transition the management of the DNS to the private sector, leading to the creation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
2. ICANN has made progress in increasing competition in the registration of domain names, but has faced challenges in addressing other guiding principles of the transition, such as increasing the stability and security of the Internet, ensuring representation of the Internet community in domain name policy-making, and using private, bottom-up coordination. In 2002, ICANN's president concluded that the organization faced serious problems and needed fundamental reform.
3. The transition of the DNS to ICANN has taken longer than anticipated, and the Department of Commerce, which is responsible for general oversight of the transition, has faced criticism for its limited public assessment of the process.

The ATA program lacks clear measures and a process for assessing sustainability, or the extent to which assistance has enabled partner nations to achieve and maintain advanced counterterrorism capabilities. State has not developed clear measures and a process for assessing sustainability and has not integrated the concept into program planning. This is an issue because sustainability is the principal intended outcome and focus of program assistance.
3. State has not complied with a congressional mandate to report to Congress on U.S. international counterterrorism assistance since 1996. Additionally, State's annual reports on ATA contained inaccurate data regarding basic program information and did not provide systematic assessments of program results.

Some programs involved exceptional assistance to particular institutions, such as American International Group (AIG), because of its systemic importance or supported particular markets while others involved assistance to individuals through refinance or loan modification programs.

	The text also describes the process by which the decision to extend TARP was made, including the analytical framework and quantitative indicators used to make the decision. The decision to extend TARP was made at the highest levels within the Treasury Department and involved considerable deliberation on the effectiveness of existing government actions and the likely effectiveness of potential policy options.

The program aims to boost international business and tourism, increase airline revenues, and create economic benefits to the United States.
2. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and gave it responsibility for establishing visa policy, including policy for the VWP. DHS created the Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit in 2004 to oversee VWP activities and monitor participating countries' adherence to the program's requirements.
3. To qualify for the VWP, a country must offer reciprocal visa-free travel privileges to U.S. citizens, have a low refusal rate for visa applicants, issue machine-readable passports, enter into an agreement with the United States to report lost or stolen passports, accept the repatriation of citizens, enter into an agreement to share information regarding whether citizens and nationals traveling to the United States represent a threat to U.S. security or welfare, and not compromise U.S. law enforcement or security interests.
4. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 and the 9/11 Act added security requirements for all VWP countries and increased the frequency of assessments of the effect of each country's continued participation in the VWP on U.S. security, law enforcement, and immigration interests.
5. DHS implemented ESTA in 2008 to collect passenger data and complete security checks on the data before passengers board a U.S. bound carrier. ESTA reduced the burden on travelers by requiring biographical information to be provided only once every 2 years and informing passengers who do not qualify for VWP travel that they need to apply for a visa before they travel to the United States.
6. DHS has not fully analyzed the risks of carrier and passenger noncompliance with the ESTA requirement. Carriers complied with the ESTA requirement to verify ESTA approval for almost 98 percent of VWP passengers in 2010, but DHS does not have a target completion date for a review to identify potential security risks associated with the small percentage of",0

3. OMB and Treasury are responsible for leading government-wide implementation of the DATA Act, with OMB releasing policy guidance and Treasury developing technical guidance for agency submissions and publication of data.
4. OMB has taken steps to help agencies meet their reporting requirements, including issuing guidance on data definition standards, a standard data exchange format, and linking agency financial systems with award systems.
5. Challenges to effective implementation of the DATA Act include issues with internal controls over financial reporting, financial management systems, and information technology security and controls.

 * ARC is a part of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt and is a self-supporting, business-like enterprise that provides common administrative services.
 * Interagency contracting, like the one between OSC and ARC, involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services.
 * OSC used 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants for the organizational assessment, but the required steps for contracting were not taken, including seeking competition among Schedule vendors and demonstrating the necessity for a sole-source order.
 * The Competition in Contracting Act requires contracting officers to promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding government contracts.
 * GSA's Schedule program is considered a competitive procedure, but ordering offices are required to follow specific procedures, including preparing a request for quotes, evaluating contractor catalogs and price lists, and placing the order with the Schedule contractor that represents the best value.
 * ARC approved a written sole-source justification prepared by OSC, but it did not contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify a sole-source order.
 * OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer's representatives without authorization or training and, further, performed other duties that should have been reserved for the contracting officer.

However, the administration's reauthorization proposal aims to change FAA's financing system to one based more on cost-based charges.

• The proposed funding structure would shift funding for the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) to user charges on commercial aircraft and fuel taxes on general aviation aircraft, while contributions from the General Fund would cover ATO costs of providing services to military and other public aircraft. Funding for AIP, EAS, and part of RE&D would come from an equal fuel tax on both general and commercial aviation and a tax on arriving and departing international passengers.

• The administration's proposal also calls for changing FAA's budget structure by establishing two new budget accounts—Air Traffic Organization and Safety and Operations—to align with FAA's lines of business and proposed funding.

 • TOD can increase access to opportunities, promote transportation options, increase transit ridership, and reduce road congestion.

 • Stakeholders involved in TOD planning and implementation include local transit agencies, state and local departments of transportation, metropolitan-planning organizations, local governments, private developers, lenders, and business improvement districts.

 • FTA provides funds for transit projects that may spur TOD but does not have a discrete program for TOD. However, FTA has been expanding its role in TOD through research, coordination with other agencies, and a transit-oriented development planning pilot program.

 • Factors that support TOD include market demand for real estate, available land for development, supportive local residents, and efficient access to jobs and activity centers. Factors that hinder TOD include higher construction costs, lenders' reluctance to finance TOD, lengthy local-development approval processes, unsupportive local population, and unattractive land around transit stations.

 • Local governments can use a variety of policies to encourage TOD, including zoning regulations, station area planning, targeted infrastructure investments, and tax incentives. These tools are most successful when they align with local residents' preferences and market demand for development.",0

The ALMRS/Modernization project consists of three components: ALMRS Initial Operating Capability (IOC), Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), and technology modernization and rehost of selected systems. The project is expected to provide an efficient means to record, maintain, and retrieve land description, ownership, and use information.
3. The ALMRS IOC component is to provide support for case processing activities and information for land and resource management activities. The GCDB component is the database that will contain geographic coordinates and survey information for land parcels. The information technology modernization and rehost component consists of installing computer and telecommunications equipment and converting selected management and administrative systems to a relational database system.
4. As of April 30, 1995, about $262.8 million had been obligated for the ALMRS/Modernization project, and BLM has designated it as a mission-critical system. However, BLM has delayed the initial hardware installation for the Alaska and Wyoming state, district, and resource area offices due to a shortage of hardware funds in fiscal year 1995.

3. IAEA derives its authority to establish and administer safeguards from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), regional nonproliferation treaties, bilateral commitments, and project agreements with states.
4. The NPT requires non-nuclear weapon states to conclude an agreement with IAEA that applies safeguards to all source and special nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the state's territory, jurisdiction, or control.
5. IAEA's safeguards objectives are to account for the amount of nuclear material necessary to produce a nuclear weapon and to detect any diversion of nuclear material from peaceful use to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes.
6. IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program, including the use of short notice and unannounced inspections, environmental sampling, and the Additional Protocol.
7. The Nuclear Suppliers Group was established in 1975 to control the export of nuclear materials and equipment and requires countries receiving nuclear exports to agree to IAEA's safeguards as a condition of supply.
8. IAEA faces limitations in its ability to draw conclusions with absolute assurance about whether a country is developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program, including limited inspection rights and practical problems such as visa and travel arrangements.

Agencies are also required to establish administrative mechanisms for affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information and report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) about the number and nature of IQA complaints and their handling of such complaints.
2. OMB, which is responsible for developing governmentwide IQA guidelines and helping agencies meet the act's requirements, considers IQA a continuation of previous federal efforts to improve the quality of information. However, OMB officials concentrated their communication and outreach efforts on cabinet-level and regulatory agencies, and many independent agencies did not have IQA guidelines in place by the required deadlines.
3. IQA requests declined from over 24,000 in fiscal year 2003 to 62 in fiscal year 2004, primarily due to changes in how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and two other agencies addressed flood insurance rate map correction requests. In fiscal year 2004, over half of the substantive IQA correction requests originated from businesses, trade groups, or other profit-oriented organizations, and over one-quarter were generated by nonprofit or other advocacy organizations.
4. Agencies addressed all IQA requests filed during the 2-year period, but substantial requests were less likely to result in an initial information change but more likely to be appealed than simple or administrative requests. The impact of IQA on agencies could not be determined because agencies and OMB do not have mechanisms in place to track the effects of implementing IQA.",0

 * The relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance has been declining, with companies increasingly tapping securities markets for their financial needs.
 * Household sector has also become less dependent on bank loans for financing, with significant amounts of home mortgage portfolios, credit card debt, and automobile loans being financed by securities.
 * The Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds Accounts, which captures the entire framework of financial transactions in the economy, was used to assess the impact of mutual funds on deposits.
 * The Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry Association (SIA) agreed that the flow of funds into mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits.
 * Despite the growth in mutual funds, they still had less money than bank deposits at year-end 1994, but the mutual fund total had risen by almost $1.2 trillion since year-end 1989, while the deposit total was $89 billion less.
 * The impact of mutual funds on deposits is difficult to quantify, but a rough estimate suggests that it may have been sizable, but probably less than $700 billion from 1990 through 1994.
 * The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should have little if any effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy.

A majority of responding sponsors reported modifying the formulas of one or more of their DB plans, with a higher percentage of sponsors decreasing the generosity of their DB plan formulas for nonbargaining employees compared to those covering bargaining unit employees.
- The key reasons cited for changing the benefit formulas of plans covering nonbargaining employees were unpredictability or volatility of DB plan funding requirements, while global or domestic competitive pressures were the key reasons for changes to plans covering collectively bargained employees. Sponsors were more likely to convert a DB plan covering nonbargaining unit employees to a hybrid plan design than to convert DB plans covering collectively bargained employees.
- Sixty-two percent of responding firms reported freezing, or limiting future pension accruals for some or all plan participants, for one or more of their plans. The vast majority of respondents also reported either increasing or not changing employer or employee contribution rates for their 401(k)-type defined contribution (DC) plans, with generally as many reporting increases to contributions as reporting no change. Many respondents also plan to implement or have already implemented an automatic enrollment feature for their DC plans.",0
467," * A refugee is defined as a person outside of their country who is unable or unwilling to return due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
* The Refugee Act of 1980 provides a systematic and permanent procedure for admitting refugees to the US and encourages them to become self-sufficient as quickly as possible.
* Several federal, state, and local government agencies coordinate with private organizations to implement the admission and resettlement process.
* The President, after consultation with Congress and certain Cabinet members, determines the maximum number of refugees the US may admit each year, with the number actually resettled typically below this maximum.
* The nine national voluntary agencies determine where refugees will live in the US, with approval from the Department of State.
* In the last 10 years, refugees have come to the US from an increasing number of countries, with many arriving after living in refugee camps for years and having little formal education or work experience.
* Three federal agencies are involved in the refugee resettlement process: the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) approves refugees for admission, the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) processes refugees overseas and partially funds services to meet their immediate needs, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) provides temporary resettlement assistance.
* ORR funds cash and medical assistance as well as social services to help refugees become economically self-sufficient, with grants provided to state refugee coordinators who may be employed by a state agency or nonprofit organization.
* States also receive funding from ORR to award discretionary grants to communities particularly affected by large numbers of refugees or to serve specific refugee populations such as the elderly.",1
468," * The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to provide government-guaranteed flood insurance to homeowners and businesses, reducing the federal government's costs for repairing flood damage after disasters.
 
 * NFIP has mapped flood risks across the country, assigning flood zone designations based on risk levels, and offers two types of flood insurance premiums: subsidized and full risk. However, the inventories of repetitive loss properties and policies with subsidized premium rates have continued to grow.
 
 * To participate in NFIP, communities agree to enforce regulations for land use and new construction in high-risk flood zones and to adopt and enforce state and community floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood damage. Currently, more than 20,000 communities participate in NFIP.
 
 * NFIP's full-risk rates may not reflect actual flood risks, and increasing premium rates to fully reflect the risk of loss would generally require reducing or eliminating subsidized and grandfathered rates, which would increase costs to some homeowners.
 
 * A variety of actions could be taken to mitigate the disadvantages of increasing premium rates, such as phasing out subsidized rates over time or not transferring them with the property when it is sold, offering targeted assistance to those most in need, and requiring those who might forego coverage to purchase it.
 
 * To reduce expenses to taxpayers, NFIP needs to be able to generate enough in premiums to pay its claims, even in years with catastrophic losses, and decreasing the risk of losses by undertaking mitigation efforts could further reduce the extent of damage from flooding.
 
 * Encouraging private market participation could transfer some or all of the federal government’s risk exposure to the private markets and away from taxpayers, but identifying ways to achieve that end has generally been elusive.",0

470,"1. The SEC oversees mutual funds through its Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), Division of Investment Management, and Division of Enforcement. OCIE examines mutual funds to evaluate compliance with federal securities laws, determine if they are operating in accordance with disclosures made to investors, and assess the effectiveness of their compliance control systems. The Division of Investment Management administers securities laws affecting funds and advisers, reviews disclosure documents, engages in rulemaking, responds to requests for exemptions from federal securities laws, and provides interpretation of those laws. The Division of Enforcement investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws related to mutual funds.
2. The SEC regulates mutual funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Company Act was passed specifically to regulate mutual funds and other types of investment companies. Under the act, mutual funds are required to register with the SEC, subjecting their activities to SEC regulation. The act also imposes requirements on the operation and structure of mutual funds. Its core objectives are to ensure that investors receive adequate and accurate information about mutual funds, protect the integrity of fund assets, prohibit abusive forms of self-dealing, prevent the issuance of securities that have inequitable or ensure the fair valuation of investor purchases and redemptions.
3. The SEC has made significant changes to its traditional examination approach to better detect potential violations, including reallocating or planning to reallocate its staff to conducting targeted examinations focusing on specific risks and monitoring larger funds on a continuous basis. However, due to the limited number of SEC's examination staff relative to the number of mutual funds and advisers for which the agency has oversight responsibility, the decision to focus examination resources on particular areas involved tradeoffs that raise regulatory challenges.
4. Historically, routine examinations of mutual fund complexes have served as the cornerstone of SEC’s mutual fund oversight, accounting for 85 percent of the total fund examinations done from 1998 through 2003. However, due to resource constraints, SEC examinations typically focused on discrete areas that staff viewed as representing the highest risks of presenting",0

 * The open bank assistance included a $970 million capital infusion from the FDIC and $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management. The FDIC received $970 million in preferred stock of a collecting bank and a guarantee for $100 million payable in 1998 towards the retirement of the collecting bank preferred stock.
 
 * Despite the recapitalization, the First City banks continued to engage in high-risk lending practices and experienced problems with the quality of their loan portfolios, leading to operating losses and the erosion of capital.
 
 * The OCC, as the primary federal bank regulator for the lead bank, and the FDIC closely monitored the First City banks following the recapitalization and considered various resolution plans.
 
 * In 1991, OCC and FDIC developed a proposal for the banks' acquisition by a stronger institution, with the possible need for FDIC financial assistance. However, this proposal was rejected by the FDIC due to its estimated cost and the difficulty of quantifying certain items.
 
 * In October 1992, the OCC advised FDIC of its plans to close First City-Houston as soon as practicable due to its insolvency. The FDIC advised that it could accelerate its projected resolution to October 30, 1992. On that same day, the OCC declared the First City-Houston bank insolvent and appointed the FDIC as receiver. The Texas Banking Commissioner also closed First City-Dallas and FDIC exercised its statutory authority to issue immediately payable cross-guarantee demands on the remaining 18 First City banks.
 
 * The FDIC considered two alternatives to provide for the orderly resolution of the First City banks: liquidating them immediately or placing them under FDIC control and operating them as bridge banks until a sale could be arranged. The FDIC chose the latter",0

474," * Medicare is a federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled beneficiaries.
 
 * Claims are processed by a network of 49 claims administration contractors called intermediaries and carriers.
 
 * Intermediaries and carriers are currently selected through a process called nomination by provider associations, such as the American Hospital Association.
 
 * Medicare contracting for intermediaries and carriers differs from most federal programs as it is not required to conduct full and open competition for contracts and contractors cannot be terminated without a public hearing.
 
 * Medicare could benefit from various contracting reforms such as choosing contractors on a competitive basis, allowing contractors to specialize in specific functions, paying contractors based on performance, and terminating contracts more efficiently.
 
 * The use of only health insurers for claims administration may have made sense when Medicare was created, but the increase in information technology and the decline in the number of health insurers willing to serve as Medicare contractors suggests that the program should consider allowing other entities to administer its claims processing and related functions.
 
 * Medicare has repeatedly submitted legislative proposals to repeal the provider nomination authority and make explicit its authority to contract for claims administration with entities other than health insurers.
 
 * Allowing Medicare to have separate contractors for specific claims administration activities and offering financial incentives to contractors for high-quality performance may improve program management.

475," * The Department of Defense (DOD) aims to increase investments in modernization without increasing overall defense budgets.
 
 * DOD has focused on reducing the cost of support operations and their associated infrastructure to free up funds for modernization or other defense priorities.
 
 * The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) requested the Defense Science Board (DSB) to identify DOD activities that could be done more efficiently by the private sector and to estimate the expected savings from outsourcing.
 
 * The DSB's first report focused solely on outsourcing and privatization issues, while the second report had a broader scope that included other methods for reducing infrastructure costs.
 
 * The DSB's first task force concluded that DOD could realize savings of 30 to 40 percent of logistics costs and achieve broad improvements in service delivery and responsiveness by outsourcing support services traditionally done by government personnel.
 
 * The DSB's second task force report provided a new vision wherein DOD would only provide warfighting, direct battlefield support, policy- and decision-making, and oversight activities, while all other activities would be done by the private sector.
 
 * The DSB estimated that DOD could save about $30 billion annually by the year 2002, primarily through outsourcing support functions, including $6 billion from CONUS logistics infrastructure activities.
 
 * The DSB's estimate of $14 billion for CONUS logistics costs is conservative, as the Navy has reported that more than $8.5 billion of Navy resources was applied in fiscal year 1996 to maintenance programs in support of fleet ships and aircraft.
 
 * DOD has significant opportunities for reducing logistics costs and improving performance by changing its business processes, including using highly accurate information systems, consolidating certain activities, employing various process streamlining methods, and outsourcing where appropriate and more cost-effective.
 
 * Adequate competition has been key to achieving significant reductions in outsourcing, and DOD has achieved benefits from outsourcing, but it has been shown that public-private competition studies are necessary to ensure competition and achieve greater savings.",0

 * NRP's reporting compliance study consists of three major processes: casebuilding, classification, and taxpayer audits.
 
 * IRS plans to conduct detailed, line-by-line audits on 1,683 of the approximately 47,000 returns in the NRP sample to assess the accuracy of NRP classification.

478,"1. The 2000 Census was marked by poor planning, which unnecessarily added to the cost, risk, and controversy of the last national head count. To prevent repeating past mistakes, the Bureau was recommended to provide comprehensive information backed by supporting documentation in its future funding requests for planning and development activities.
2. The Bureau's three-legged stool strategy for the 2010 Census includes updating and modernizing the MAF/TIGER system, replacing the long form with the American Community Survey (ACS), and conducting a short-form-only census. This strategy is generally aligned with three of the Bureau's four key goals for the 2010 Census: increasing the relevance and timeliness of census long-form data, reducing operational risk, and increasing the coverage and accuracy of the census.
3. The Bureau's planning for the 2010 Census has improved compared with its efforts for the 2000 Census, but certain information gaps remain, such as the lack of complete life cycle cost estimates for the three-legged stool design, including ACS. The Bureau is taking a significant risk by pinning the success of its reform efforts largely on a survey that may not be an adequate replacement for the long form.
4. The Bureau's decision on how coverage evaluation data will be used in 2010 appears to be premature, as it has not yet determined the feasibility of refinements to the 2000 approach or alternative methodologies. The Bureau should research procedures that would allow adjustment, if necessary, for those purposes for which it is both legal and appropriate to do so.
5. The Bureau's 2010 planning process still contains certain weak points that if not addressed could undermine a cost-effective head count and make it more difficult to obtain the support of Congress and other stakeholders. The Bureau should develop a more rigorous plan that includes milestones for completing key activities, itemizes the estimated cost of each component, articulates a clear system of coordination among project components, and translates key goals into measurable, operational terms to provide meaningful guidance for planning and measuring progress.",0

• Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists play a crucial role in the MHSS medical readiness mission by providing mental health care that helps military active-duty personnel perform their duties before, during, and after combat or military operations. Psychiatrists can diagnose and treat mental conditions medically, while psychologists are trained in psychosocial approaches to diagnosing and treating mental illness.
• The MHSS created the PDP to increase the scope of practice of clinical psychologists in the military so they could treat their patients with psychotropic medication when needed. The PDP was established in response to a conference report dated September 28, 1988, and the Army’s Office of the Surgeon General was tasked with designing and implementing the program.
• The PDP faced several problems during implementation, including lack of a clearly defined purpose, difficulty recruiting participants, unspecified participant selection criteria, repeated changes in the curriculum, delays in granting prescribing privileges, and unresolved issues involving supervision.
• The MHSS has determined that it has at least as many uniformed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists as it needs to meet its current and upcoming readiness requirements. Therefore, there seems to be no current or upcoming need for psychologists who may prescribe drugs.",1

* JWST is facing technical challenges and risks, including the development of a new cryocooler system and the integration and testing of the various elements and major subsystems. The project has allocated schedule reserve to address these risks, but the exhaustion of schedule reserve on one element or major subsystem can impact the overall project schedule.
* The JWST project is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining, but all elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the critical path. This means that any delay to an activity on the critical path could reduce schedule reserve and potentially impact the overall project schedule.
* The project has used more than 30 percent of its schedule reserve established at the time of the replan in 2011 to address technical challenges. The final three integration and test efforts, which will take place over the next 3 years, have a set amount of time allocated, and any significant problems could easily use up the available schedule reserve.
* The project is taking proactive steps to reduce risk before testing needs to commence by ensuring the availability and readiness of test equipment and the cryogenic chamber to be used to test the optics of JWST. However, the unusual complexity of JWST and the potential for unforeseen technical challenges during integration and testing means that the project must prioritize the mitigation of issues when they arise.",1

2. Several environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, have led to the proposal or finalization of four key regulations affecting coal-fueled units.
3. These regulations have potentially significant implications for public health and the environment, including reducing SO emissions and mercury emissions from coal-fueled electricity generating units.
4. EPA has proposed new regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating units, which would impact the electricity industry, including coal-fueled generating units.
5. State environmental and electricity regulators, system planners, DOE, FERC, and other key stakeholders have a role in mitigating some potential adverse implications of these regulations.
6. DOE, EPA, and FERC have taken initial steps to monitor industry progress in responding to the regulations, including jointly conducting regular meetings with key industry stakeholders.

However, the Foundation has experienced significant financial, managerial, and internal control problems, and its liabilities substantially exceed its assets. The Foundation's financial condition casts doubt on whether it can continue its operations.

• The Foundation has spent approximately 63% of its revenues for its stated program activities from 1986 to 1992 and about 83% in 1993. The Foundation contracted with a travel agency for the purpose of facilitating travel services for Foundation members and others who planned to attend the commemorative events for the 50th anniversary of D-Day. There were allegations of financial impropriety against the Foundation and its then president, Anthony C. Stout, which were investigated and found to be unsupported.",1
493,"• Pension plans, both public and private, invest in defined benefit (DB) plans which promise to pay retirement benefits based on an employee's salary and years of service. The financial health of these plans depends on adequate contributions and prudent investments that preserve principal and yield an adequate rate of return over time.

• Hedge funds and private equity are investment options for pension plans. Hedge funds typically invest in a variety of financial instruments and seek positive returns while avoiding loss of principal. Private equity funds typically make longer-term investments in private companies and seek to obtain financial returns through long-term appreciation based on corporate stewardship, improved operating processes, and financial restructuring. However, both types of investments are considered riskier than traditional investments and may not be suitable for all pension plans.",1
494,"• The United States territories of American Samoa, CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have some discretion in setting Medicaid and CHIP eligibility standards and provider payment rates, but there are significant differences in how these programs are funded compared to states. The federal matching rate for territories' Medicaid programs is fixed at a lower end of the range available to states, and federal Medicaid funding in territories is subject to a statutory cap. These funding differences, along with differences in the costs of health care, have contributed to lower federal and territory Medicaid program expenditures in the territories.

• Territories have flexibility in administering their Medicaid and CHIP programs, resulting in differences in program eligibility and benefits. For example, Puerto Rico uses its CHIP funds to cover additional children in its Medicaid programs, while Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands base program eligibility on local poverty levels that are more restrictive than federal standards. Additionally, the territories vary in the range of benefits covered by their respective Medicaid programs, with some not covering all mandatory benefits due to limited funding and infrastructure.",1

 * EPA administers the program, oversees cleanups performed by the parties responsible for contaminating the sites, and performs cleanups itself. State governments also have a role in the Superfund process.
 
 * EPA maintains a list of hazardous sites, known as the National Priorities List (NPL), that the agency considers to present the most serious threats to human health and the environment. Only sites placed on the list are eligible for long-term cleanup financed by the agency under the trust fund established by CERCLA.
 
 * As of October 1997, there were 3,036 sites awaiting a NPL decision, representing only a portion of the sites that EPA has evaluated and classified over the history of the Superfund program.
 
 * EPA has completed cleanup construction at 585 of the more than 1,400 sites it has placed on the NPL. States have reported cleaning up thousands of sites under their own programs and authorities.
 
 * Responses to surveys of officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states indicate that 1,789 of the 3,036 sites classified by EPA’s database as awaiting a NPL decision are potentially eligible for the list. Another 1,234 sites are unlikely to become eligible for the Superfund program for various reasons.
 
 * Most of the 1,789 sites that are potentially eligible for the NPL pose risks to human health or the environment and are contaminated most often with metals and volatile organic compounds. Officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states who responded to a survey characterized the risks presented by about two-thirds of the potentially eligible sites, saying that about 17 percent of the sites currently pose high human health and environmental risks and another 10 percent of the sites potentially pose high future risks.",0

* Crude oil prices are estimated using forecasts provided by OMB, which are based on economic assumptions from the Troika (Council of Economic Advisors, Department of the Treasury, and OMB).
* DOD adds a refinement markup to account for the cost of refining crude oil into refined products, and nonproduct costs to cover DLA's overhead and other costs.
* The military services use the standard price and their estimated fuel requirements to develop their operation and maintenance budget requests.
* DOD utilizes its Defense-wide Working Capital Fund to purchase bulk fuel for customers, with the goal of remaining revenue-neutral over time.
* Differences between estimated and actual fuel costs from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 were primarily due to fluctuations in the market price of fuel and differences between the services' estimated and actual fuel consumption.
* DOD has not updated its current approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions or documented its rationale for the assumptions it uses in estimating the standard price.

DOD's budgeting process and the wide range of organizations focused on technology development further complicate the process. To address these challenges, DOD and Congress have established various technology transition programs, such as the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program and the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program. However, these programs represent a small portion of DOD's overall spending on technology development.

These programs, managed by DOD's Office of Defense Research and Engineering, aim to speed the transition of technologies into acquisition programs, introduce innovative and cost-saving technologies, and field test technology prototypes. Although these programs have shown promise, their impact on technology transition is still not fully determined due to limited performance measures and a small number of completed projects.

• The Study Group reviewed over 1,000 documents and identified 61 programs that specifically targeted girls’ delinquency, which were then assessed for methodological quality using DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs’ What Works criteria.
• The Study Group's methods for assessing studies and involving practitioners were consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards.
• However, 8 out of 18 experts criticized the What Works criteria for creating an unrealistically high standard, causing the group to overlook potentially promising programs.
• The Study Group found that few girls’ delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs.
• OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs be better prepared for evaluations of their effectiveness, but could improve its girls’ delinquency goals by developing specific plans for supporting such evaluations.
• The Study Group reported that among the 17 programs that had been studied, none provided conclusive evidence of effectiveness.

However, it is subject to oversight by Congress and conducts monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.
* The Federal Reserve operates in a unique public and private structure, consisting of the Board of Governors, the 12 Reserve Banks, and the FOMC. The Board of Governors is an independent regulatory federal agency located in Washington, D.C., and has broad interest in monitoring and promoting the stability of financial markets. The Reserve Banks are not federal agencies, but rather federally chartered corporations with a board of directors and member banks that are stockholders.
* The Federal Reserve derives income primarily from the interest on its holdings of U.S. government securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt acquired through open market operations. It also earns income from interest on loans to depository institutions, reimbursements for services performed as fiscal agent for Treasury and other agencies, and fees received for payment services provided to depository institutions.
* The Federal Reserve Act requires the Board of Governors to submit written reports to Congress twice each year containing discussions of the conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects for the future.

- An enterprise architecture is a blueprint that describes an organization's current and desired state in logical and technical terms, as well as a plan for transitioning between the two states. It is used to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability in business processes and systems. The concept of enterprise architectures has been around since the mid-1980s and various frameworks have been published by government agencies and OMB. Legislation and federal guidance requires agencies to develop and use architectures.

• Congress has enacted several laws to recognize the concerns and effects of hate crimes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, and the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1994.

• The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 expanded the scope of hate crime victims to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.

• The commerce clause, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, and section 2 of the 13th and 15th Amendments are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing Congress's authority to proscribe hate crimes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation.

• The commerce clause authorizes Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, including the use of the channels of interstate commerce, persons or things in interstate commerce, and activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.

• The Supreme Court narrowed the ""affects interstate commerce"" category with its decision in United States v. Morrison, rejecting the argument that Congress may regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.

• Hate crimes that involve interstate travel continue to be within the commerce clause's reach, but attempts to broaden the scope of hate crime legislation tied to findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes under the commerce clause are constitutionally suspect.

• Hate-driven denials by state officers or those acting under the color of law of equal protection or due process, or the right to vote fall within the scope of the legislative sections of the 14th and 15th Amendments, while hate crimes committed by private individuals not acting under the color of law are beyond their scope.

• East Asian governments have adopted various exchange rate policies, ranging from a ""linked"" exchange rate with the U.S. dollar in Hong Kong to a ""free float"" in Japan, with most choosing a ""managed float"" that allows for some intervention in forex markets.
• A pegged exchange rate policy can eliminate exchange-rate risk but may result in a loss of autonomy in domestic monetary policy and potential rapid changes in domestic prices.
• A ""managed float"" policy allows a country to intervene in forex markets when certain economic indicators reach critical levels, and China used this policy from 2005 to 2008 to appreciate its currency by 21% against the U.S. dollar.

534," * Reforming or limiting itemized tax deductions for individuals is being considered to increase federal tax revenue, increase the share of taxes paid by higher-income tax filers, simplify the tax code, or reduce incentives for inefficient economic behavior. However, limits on deductions may have adverse economic effects or change the distributional burden of the federal income tax code.
* In 2014, 30% of tax filers chose to itemize their deductions, with higher-income tax filers more likely to itemize and claim larger average total deductions. The majority of itemizers had incomes less than $100,000, but tax filers with an AGI over $1 million claimed 13.1% of all itemized deductions.
* Differences in income and the structure of certain provisions explain variation in itemized deduction claims. Tax filers in higher-income ranges claimed deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes at higher rates. Fewer tax filers in the highest income group claimed the home mortgage interest deduction, possibly due to a greater ability to pay for home purchases with cash.
* The four itemized deductions projected to contribute most to tax expenditures in FY2018 are the deduction for state and local income or sales taxes, the deduction for home mortgage interest, charitable gifts, and real estate taxes. These deductions are estimated to account for 17.8% ($241.2 billion) of the approximately $1.36 trillion in net individual tax expenditures.",1

536," * The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the listing and protection of species that are endangered or threatened with extinction, resulting in limitations on activities that could affect those species and penalties for taking individuals of a listed species.
 * Federal agencies are required to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether an agency project might jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify a species' critical habitat, concluding with the issuance of a biological opinion on the harm the project poses.
 * The exemption process is available for federal agencies, state governors, or permit/license applicants if a project cannot be conducted without jeopardizing species and the federal agency believes that the reasonable and prudent alternatives would thwart the project. The process offers the opportunity to consider extraordinary economic circumstances and provides for an independent administrative law judge hearing.
 * There have been only six instances in which an exemption was sought under the ESA, and only two in which it was granted. The historical prologue of these past applications may prove useful for future applications.
 * The ESA exemption process is used rarely, and the debate over ESA and species protection typically signals an intensification of an underlying and usually much larger struggle over the basic allocation of resources.",0
537,"• The net capital loss limitation was originally enacted to prevent taxpayers from manipulating the timing of the realization of their capital gains and losses to minimize their income tax liabilities. The limitation reduces a taxpayer's ability to deduct capital losses against other income without limit, which could significantly reduce their net federal income taxes.

• The current system, even without indexing the $3,000 loss for inflation, is more generous than the system that existed in 1978. The empirical evidence shows that capital gains are concentrated at the higher end of the income range, and most lower and middle income taxpayers are unlikely to be much affected by the expansion of capital losses because they do not directly hold stock or have their assets in tax-favored forms.",1
538," * The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) recognizes the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing.
* The NLRA applies only to ""employees,"" and not to supervisors. An employee is considered a supervisor if they have the authority to perform any one of 12 specified functions, if the exercise of such authority requires the use of independent judgment and is not merely routine or clerical.
* In the case of Kentucky River Community Care, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court established a three-part test for determining supervisory status under the NLRA. Employees will be considered supervisors if they hold the authority to engage in any one of the twelve supervisory functions identified in section 2(11) of the NLRA, their exercise of authority is not of a ""merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment,"" and their authority is held in the interest of the employer.
* The NLRA prohibits certain misconduct by both employers and unions that interferes with the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining. This includes verbal threats to adversely affect an employee's employment status or working conditions, and interrogation of employees as to union sympathy and affiliation.
* An employer's communication to its employees constitutes an unlawful threat for purposes of section 8(a)(1) if it contains a 'threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit' or if it is phrased in a way that conveys a management decision already arrived at to close the plant in case of unionization.
* The NLRB has long maintained that an employer may make anti-union, but noncoercive, speeches to their employees on company time and on company property without allowing a union an equal opportunity to reply. However, last-minute speeches made by employers and mass election speeches on company time to massed assemblies of employees within 24 hours before an election are prohibited.
* An employer cannot be compelled to allow the distribution of union literature on its premises if a union can reach employees through other channels of communication. However, if the employer's location and the employees' residences place the employees beyond the reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with them, the employer must allow the union to approach its employees on its property.

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a separate tax calculation with a broader base than the regular tax, including certain itemized deductions, the standard deduction, and personal exemptions. However, it does not include the benefits of lower capital gains tax rates and the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds.
2. The number of taxpayers subject to the AMT has significantly increased since 1987 due to inflation and the elimination of the capital gains exclusion in 1986. The Joint Tax Committee projects that over 9 million taxpayers will pay the AMT in 2009, covering 6.3% of all tax returns filed.
3. The AMT exemptions are not indexed to inflation, causing an increase in the number of taxpayers who are covered by the AMT. The shift in exposure to the AMT from the very highest income classes to the middle and upper middle income classes is dramatic over time.
4. The cost of correcting the AMT is significant, with indexing AMT exemptions costing $13.9 billion by 2008 and eliminating the credit limit provision costing many billions of dollars by 2008 or 2009.

However, opponents argue that it would increase costs for producers and result in higher retail food prices. Additionally, major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market may seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports.",1

 * Serbia has since held largely free and fair elections, but its transition to democratic and free market standards has been uneven. Organized crime and high-level corruption remain serious problems, and the global economic crisis has set back the country's economy.
 
 * Serbia has set integration in the European Union as its key foreign policy goal, but its prospects have been clouded by concerns over its relations with its former Kosovo province, which declared independence in 2008. U.S.-Serbian relations have also been affected by the U.S.'s role in promoting Kosovo's independence.
 
 * In May 2012, Serbia held parliamentary, presidential, and local elections. A coalition led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won the most seats in parliament, while Tomislav Nikolic of the SNS defeated incumbent President Tadic in the presidential runoff.
 
 * The new government, led by the Socialist Party of Serbia and including the SNS and the United Regions of Serbia, took office in July 2012. The government has focused on fighting corruption and improving the economy, but has faced challenges including the powers of the autonomous region of Vojvodina and tensions in the Presevo Valley.

 * In Florida v. Harris, the Court ruled that an alert by a trained drug-detection dog is sufficient to establish probable cause for a search of a vehicle.

 * Bailey v. United States addressed the question of whether the detention of an individual who has just left premises to be searched under warrant is permissible, and the Court held that it is when the individual is detained out of view of the house as soon as possible.

 * Missouri v. McNeely dealt with whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases. The Court rejected a per se rule and held that the existence of the ""destruction of the evidence"" exception must be determined on a case-by-case basis.",0

3. The campus-based programs have come to play a relatively smaller role in the federal student aid effort, with only 2% of the $125 billion of federal aid made available to students in FY2016 going to these programs.
4. The Federal Perkins Loan program, the oldest of the campus-based aid programs, was originally enacted in 1958 as a response to the space-race between the United States and the Soviet Union and concerns over national security.
5. The FWS program was originally authorized as the College Work Study program under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to stimulate and promote the part-time employment of students in institutions of higher education who are from low-income families.
6. The FSEOG program, which was originally enacted as the Education Opportunity Grants under the HEA, was extended and renamed as the FSEOG program in 1972 to serve as a supplement to the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program.
7. The campus-based aid programs were among the first of the federally funded student aid programs, each designed to increase access to higher education for students who demonstrated financial need.

- The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides federal assistance to workers who lose their jobs due to foreign competition, including funding for training and reemployment services, income support, and a tax credit for health insurance premiums.
- TAA was reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA) and is jointly administered by the federal government and the states, with funding provided by mandatory appropriations.
- Eligibility for TAA is based on job loss due to foreign trade and meeting specific statutory criteria, with a two-stage process for petitioning and applying for benefits.
- TAA benefits for individual workers include training and reemployment services, income support, and a tax credit for health insurance premiums.
- TAA training programs are decentralized and vary in duration and cost, with no federal limit on the amount of training funding an individual can receive.

• Gross job loss is the total number of jobs eliminated by all contracting firms in a given period, while net job loss is the result of greater gross job loss than gross job gains in a given period. Economists view net job loss as detrimental, but gross job loss as a normal part of a functioning market economy.

• A quarterly data series from the BLS shows that gross job loss and gains are each, on average, around 20 times higher than net job loss in any given quarter. The rate of job gains increased steadily from the beginning of the series in 1992 until the end of 1999, while job losses increased steadily from 1992 to 2001.

• Most of the gross job flows occur at existing firms, and are not due to new firms opening or old firms closing. Gross job loss is not incompatible with a healthy labor market.

• Trade liberalization has no effect on net employment, as shown by the historical experience of U.S. trade becoming progressively liberalized since the 1940s. Employment has steadily increased during the post-war period, and the unemployment rate has mirrored the business cycle, not trade patterns.

• The decline in manufacturing employment in recent years is primarily attributable to rapid technological change and efficiency gains, not trade.

• Public policies to protect workers against the risks posed by gross job loss can be justified on both social and economic grounds. If crafted properly, they have been shown not to reduce gross job gains, and they can arguably raise efficiency by addressing market failures.",0

To improve proteome coverage, samples are typically fractionated at either the protein or peptide level, or both. Regardless of the initial fractionation methods used, the final step in most strategies involves analysis of tryptic peptides by LC-MS/MS. Undersampling, where only a subset of the peptides are identified, can occur if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer.

601,"• The study found that the incidence of secondary, delayed hemorrhage was significantly higher in patients who underwent tonsillectomy (5.05%) compared to those who underwent submucosal uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy (smuppp) (1.45%).
• The study suggests that suturing both the muscular and mucosal layers of the tonsillar fossa in smuppp, as well as double-layer closure and approximating muscular and mucosal layers after tonsillectomy, might help postoperative oropharyngeal healing and decrease bleeding incidence.",1

<summary>

* The -lactam and -lactam scaffolds are important in various biologically relevant compounds and pharmaceuticals.
* The group has explored the synthesis of -lactams using aryl-, thioaryl-, and cyano-substituted anhydrides.
* One-pot four-component reactions (4CRs) are possible with thioaryl substitution.
* Computational studies suggest that cyanosuccinic anhydride reactions proceed by a Mannich-like mechanism via the enol tautomer.
* Related reactions reported by Castagnoli, Cushman, and Haimova likely proceed by this mechanism.
* The anhydrides used are poorly enolizable and require forcing conditions.
* Cushman and Haimova reported analogous reactions with homophthalic anhydride, which is highly enolizable and reacts at lower temperatures.
* The group explored Mannich-type reactions and related 4CRs of variously substituted anhydrides.
* Aryl-substituted succinic anhydrides showed some variation in reactivity, but direct attachment of an electron-withdrawing group resulted in higher reactivity.
* The diastereoselectivity was reversed in the case of cyanosuccinic anhydrides and could be controlled by resident stereogenic centers.

Note: The text provided seems to be a continuation of a larger document, and it is not clear what the specific procedures and results mentioned in the text refer to. The above summary is a general summary of the main points made in the text.",1
603,"1. The text discusses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in breast cancer, specifically focusing on the miRNAs -125a, -206, -145, -21, and -10b. These miRNAs have been found to have altered expression in breast cancer tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues.
2. Low expression of -125a, -206, and -145, and high expression of -21 and -10b, are associated with breast cancer. These miRNAs have been shown to play a role in the invasion, development, and metastasis of breast cancer.
3. The text also discusses the correlation between these miRNAs and various clinical pathological factors such as tumor size, lymph node metastasis, patient age, menstruation, and expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2, and topoisomerase 2a (TOP2A).
4. The study found that -145 and -206 were negatively correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis, while -145 was also correlated with negative ER, HER-2, and TOP2A. -21 exhibited high expression in older, postmenopausal patients with lymph node metastasis and positive HER-2, while -10b was related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and positive TOP2A.
5. The text concludes by stating that these miRNAs have the potential to be novel tumor markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer, and that further investigation is needed to determine their mechanism and potential as treatment targets in clinical applications.",0
604," • Transplantation is limited by organ shortage and unfavorable long-term success due to chronic allograft injury (CAI), which is caused by chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV), glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA).
 • The pathogenesis of CAI is poorly understood, but acute rejection episodes are an important risk factor. A model of transplantation in Fischer-344 (F344) to Lewis rat strain combination is used to study CAI, where immunosuppression is omitted.
 • Acute rejection in F344 to Lewis renal allografts is characterized by a strong mononuclear infiltration of the allograft interstitium and numerous leukocytes in the blood vessels. After resolution of acute rejection, the number of intravascular leukocytes decreases but remains chronically elevated.
 • A majority of blood leukocytes in day 9 allografts are monocytes displaying a unique state of partial activation regarding cell surface antigen and cytokine expression. These cells interact with graft endothelial cells and might trigger CAV, which is characterized by intimal hyperplasia.
 • In a gene array experiment, tissue transglutaminase (transglutaminase 2, TG2) was found to be upregulated by mononuclear leukocytes accumulating in the lumina of allograft blood vessels. TG2 is a protein that catalyzes posttranscriptional modifications of proteins, resulting in cross-linking of proteins and modifications via amine incorporation into proteins and via deamidation.
 • TG2 is involved in numerous cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell survival, phagocytosis, cell adhesion and migration, and cell signaling. It is expressed in virtually all compartments of the cell and can be attached to the surface and secreted into the extracellular space.
 • The study investigates TG2 mRNA and protein expression by mononuclear blood leukocytes isolated from Lewis to Lewis isografts and F344 to Lewis allografts and by respective renal tissue TG2 expressions compared to activated",0
605,"* The study involves the use of endothelial cells grown to confluence and stimulated with plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to produce extracellular vesicles or microparticles (EMps).
* The EMps were characterized and quantified using flow cytometric analysis based on CD31- and annexin V-positivity, and their size distribution was measured using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
* The EMps were introduced to a model patient's circulation, which was then circulated through a continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) filter for a period of 70 minutes.
* Flow cytometric analysis was used to measure the EMps levels in the perfusate at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 minutes of dialysis.
* The study found that counter-current dialysis using a standard clinical CVVH filter and under clinical conditions can remove EMps from a model patient's circulation.
* The decline in EMps levels due to dialysis is rapid, with 50% of clearance seen in the first 30 minutes and a relatively constant emp concentration from 40 to 70 minutes.
* The dialysate contained 5.7% of the original EMps concentration at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis.
* The study suggests that frequent changing of the CVVH filter and more efficient and selective EMps clearance can be realized by conjugating endothelium-specific antibodies to commercially available specialty CVVH filters.
* Clinical data support the protective role of CVVH in acute lung injury (ALI) management, and the study plans to assay patients pre- and post-dialysis to observe EMps concentration effects.",1
606," * Frequent angina is associated with greater physical limitations and decreased quality of life.
 * The goals of chronic stable angina management include controlling symptoms and reducing the risk of adverse clinical outcomes.
 * Maximum consideration should be given to management options that reduce angina symptoms, including physical activity programs and optimal medical therapy.
 * Optimal medical therapy includes anti-ischemic agents such as short- and long-acting nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers.
 * Nitrates reduce angina symptoms and prolong exercise duration and/or time to ST-segment depression.
 * A combination of drugs is often necessary for optimal symptom control.
 * Sublingual nitroglycerin increases exercise tolerance and is an important part of optimal medical therapy for patients with stable angina.
 * Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits of using routine prophylactic nitroglycerin spray in patients with stable angina.",0
607," * Residual and resistant microorganisms, including fungi like Candida albicans, are common reasons for failures in root canal treatments.
* Candida albicans is present in 20% of endodontic treatment failures and has a tendency to invade dentin, making it a key factor in periradicular diseases.
* The presence of Candida albicans in endodontic treatment failures may be due to coronal leakage after or contamination during the treatment.
* Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a gold standard for root-end filling materials due to its excellent sealing ability, biocompatibility, high alkalinity, radiopacity, antimicrobial effects, and resistance to fluid and blood contamination.
* MTA Angelus has advantages over ProRoot MTA, such as good marginal adaptation, good sealing, sealing ability in mineralized tissues with complete closure, and has been reported to be inflammation-free in most cases.
* MTA Angelus has an excellent antibacterial effect and a strong fungicidal effect against Candida albicans.
* A study compared the antifungal properties of fresh and set ProRoot MTA and MTA Angelus against Candida albicans and found no significant difference between the two materials.
* The study's null hypothesis was accepted, indicating that there is no difference in the in vitro antifungal properties of these two materials.",1
608,"* Motor and sensory deficits are often evident in the upper limb on the side contralateral to a stroke-damaged hemisphere.
* Subtle motor deficits have been found in the ipsilateral upper limb, demonstrating chronic persistence.
* Clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient to differentiate ipsilateral motor deficits, but laboratory testing has identified deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function.
* Kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb have been found in performance of specific motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination.
* Several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits have been suggested, including disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere, dysfunction of the uncrossed corticospinal track, or the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions.
* Most studies of ipsilateral deficits in stroke patients have concentrated on motor deficits, rather than sensory deficits.
* A study was conducted to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb of stroke patients and to examine the correlation between the two variables using a tracking and reposition sense test.
* The study found that stroke patients had a lower accuracy index in the metacarpophalangeal (mp) joint and a higher score of reposition errors in the joint reposition test compared to sex- and age-matched normal subjects.
* Ipsilateral sensory deficits showed significant correlation with motor deficits, indicating stroke patients would have difficulty in performing complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions using pure integrity of movement accuracy and proprioceptive sense.",1
609,"1. * The use of nanoparticles for targeted delivery of biopharmaceutical agents to specific cells has been a long-term goal, but specific binding mediated cell entry can be overwhelmed by non-specific enhanced cell uptake mechanisms.*
2. * A post-coupling methodology has been developed to attach targeting ligands to nanoparticles with controlled mol% attachment and ligand orientation, which has been used to create integrin-targeted imaging nanoparticles for specific delivery of siRNA to v3/5 integrin-receptor presenting cells in vitro.*",0

* The Millennium Cohort Study is the largest prospective study using primary data collection ever undertaken by the Department of Defense (DoD).
* The study began in 2001 and includes participants from the first enrollment cycle, which spanned 2001-2003 and comprised 77,047 participants.
* The study collected data on health, behavioral risk factors, and occupational characteristics related to military service that may be associated with adverse health outcomes.
* The study found that trouble sleeping, sleep duration of 5 hours compared to 7 hours, and sleep apnea were significantly associated with higher odds of incident diabetes.
* Several military service characteristics remained significantly related to the outcome, including no deployment, enlisted pay grade, administration/supply occupation, and having separated from the military since baseline.
* Binge or problem drinking and current smoking were also significantly associated with higher odds of new-onset diabetes after adjustment.
* Screening positive for depression, panic, other anxiety disorder, and PTSD were all significantly associated with higher odds of new-onset diabetes in adjusted models.
* The study suggests that the associations between type 2 diabetes risk and mental health conditions and sleep characteristics, if causal, may involve different pathways.
* The study is the first to consider mental health conditions other than depression as potential confounding factors and to measure their occurrence prior to the onset of diabetes.

611,"1. * A retrospective review of 13 patients with mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver was conducted, with radiological and clinical findings reviewed and classified into three types based on the extent of the cystic component on CT scans.*
2. * The three types of tumors are: multiseptated cystic (purely cystic with multiple thin septa), mixed cystic and solid (partially cystic with irregular thick septa and a solid portion), and solid (purely solid without a cystic portion).*
3. * The study found that mesenchymal hamartomas can show a wide spectrum of radiological features, including a multiseptated cystic tumor, mixed solid and cystic tumor, and even a solid tumor, with heterogeneous enhancement and absence of a tumor capsule being helpful in the differential diagnosis from other tumors.*",0
612,"1. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects people of all ages, but its prevalence increases with age and is more common in women. The prevalence of RA in Northern Europe and North America is estimated to be 0.5-1%, while in Southern Europe, it is estimated to be lower, at 0.45-0.66%. The annual incidence of RA is also lower in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe.
2. RA is associated with a significant economic burden for patients, families, and health care systems. The costs of RA are affected by methods of calculation, reimbursement policies, availability of drugs and social services, and country-specific treatment guidelines. In Italy, the costs of RA are expected to increase due to the aging population and the introduction of newer, costly therapies.
3. Studies have estimated the prevalence of RA in Italy to be around 0.5%, but most of these studies have been conducted in small communities or at a regional level. The largest study, which involved more than 4.5 million people, indicated that both the prevalence and incidence of RA progressively increase in both men and women up to the age of 80 years.
4. The severity and progression of RA have a great influence on the costs of the disease. Disease progression is associated with increasing functional impairment and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which may lead to work absenteeism and inability and hence increased indirect costs. The introduction of biological drugs for the treatment of RA highlights the role of economics in considerations for patient access to innovative but expensive treatments.",0
613,"1. A patient with missing teeth and restricted mouth opening due to oral submucous fibrosis and bilateral angular cheilitis was treated with sectional maxillary and mandibular final impression procedures, followed by fabricating maxillary hinged and mandibular sectional and hinged complete dentures.
2. The text also discusses various techniques for fabricating sectional and hinged tray/complete dentures for patients with restricted mouth opening (microstomia), including modified impression procedures and prosthesis design.
3. The use of sectional impression techniques and/or sectional dentures can help overcome clinical difficulties in constructing dentures for patients with limited mouth opening, but may require additional time, labor, and materials. This particular technique can be accomplished in any dental laboratory without using complicated machinery or attachment devices.",0
614,"• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality.
• The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Met, promote cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.
• HGF-c-Met axis activation is implicated in cellular invasion and metastases through induction of increased proliferation, migration and mobility, three-dimensional epithelial cell organization, and angiogenesis.
• Dysregulation of the HGF-c-Met pathway plays an essential role in mammalian development and is likely to be critical in many aspects of adult homeostasis. However, dysregulation of this pathway also plays a key role in malignant transformation by promoting tumor cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
• Overexpression of HGF and c-Met is observed in a significant portion of human HCC samples, and is associated with poor prognosis, aggressive phenotype, increased vascular invasion, increased microvessel density, and decreased mean survival time.
• Pharmacologic c-Met inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC, with several inhibitors in active clinical trials. These inhibitors can be broadly classified into biologic antagonists, c-Met adaptor protein inhibitors, small-molecule downstream pathway inhibitors, and small synthetic Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
• TKIs are the most common c-Met inhibitors in development, with two promising results in the phase 2 randomized setting for HCC: tivantinib and cabozantinib. However, it is unclear which genetic and molecular abnormalities implicated in HGF-c-Met dysregulation are predictive of sensitivity to c-Met targeted therapy. Ongoing trials must address the challenge of identifying patients most likely to achieve maximal benefit and minimal toxicity.",1
615," • Recent epidemiologic studies have confirmed an increased risk of certain types of malignancies, including breast, colon, and pancreatic tumors, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
• Several studies have suggested a potential link between the long-acting insulin analogue glargine and cancer risk, but the clinical implications remain controversial and further research is needed to determine if glargine is associated with increased cancer risk compared with other commonly used forms of insulin.",1
616," * Adamantinoma of the tibia is a slow-growing primary bone tumor, with approximately 300 cases reported in English literature.
* The most common site of metastasis is the lungs, but regional lymph node metastases are rare and there is limited information on their management.
* The relationship between osteofibrous/fibrous dysplasia and adamantinoma is controversial, with some authors considering them as a spectrum of disease.
* The text describes two cases of tibial adamantinoma, one of which presented with groin metastases initially diagnosed as cutaneous eccrine carcinoma.
* A review of inguinal nodal metastatic adamantinoma is outlined, with a table of 10 cases reported in English literature since 1930.
* Adamantinoma can be divided into two main groups based on histology and biological behavior: classical and differentiated adamantinoma.
* Risk factors for metastases include male sex, persistent pain, symptoms of less than five years duration, and inadequate initial treatment.",1
617,"1. * Antireflection (AR) technology is important for high-efficiency solar cells, and can be improved through the use of nanostructures made of wide bandgap materials, such as ZnO, which can be fabricated using techniques like pulsed laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and hydrothermal method.
2. * ZnO nanostructures, such as nanorod arrays, can exhibit better AR properties than other oxide compounds and have been shown to improve the efficiency of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells by 3% when used as the AR layer.
3. * The growth of ZnO nanowhiskers (NWS) on CZ silicon solar cells can be controlled through a seeding and growth two-step process in zinc salt and amide mixed solutions, which is low cost and has good potential for scale-up.
4. * The density and length of ZnO NWS can be optimized by controlling the time of growth, and the resulting NWS can reduce the reflectivity of the solar cells effectively and improve the external quantum efficiency in a large spectral region.
5. * However, long-time immersion of solar cells in aqueous solution during the ZnO NW growth process can deteriorate the solar cell performance. This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Key Technology R&D Program, Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, and Innovation Team Project of Zhejiang Province.",0
618," * Hyperhidrosis is a condition that affects 0.6 to 1.0% of the population and generally occurs in the axillae, palms, plantar surface of the feet, and face.
 * The principal characteristics of this condition include intense discomfort experienced by patients, affecting their social, affective, and professional lives.
 * Primary hyperhidrosis generally manifests in childhood and early adolescence, does not occur during sleep, and can be exacerbated by emotional stress.
 * Although various treatment options are available, such as topical and systemic therapies, iontophoresis, regional nerve block, and botulinum toxin injection, they have their limitations.
 * Video-assisted thoracic sympathicotomy (VATS) has been accepted globally as a form of treatment for primary palmar hyperhidrosis.
 * A study was conducted to compare two simplified methods for the treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis, in which the sympathetic chain was transected in merely one segment at the level of either the third or fourth rib.
 * The study found that the incidence of moderate to severe compensatory sweating was higher in the r3 (71.8%) group than r4 (33%, p=0.02).
 * No patient requested reoperation in either group, and no patient expressed regret after surgery.
 * The study suggests that r4 sympathicotomy decreases the extent of side effects but does not compromise efficacy, and should be the method of choice for the treatment of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.",0
619," * Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons with Lewy bodies.
 * The clinical diagnosis of PD is often straightforward, but it can be challenging in mild or uncertain cases and in differentiating it from other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration.
 * Molecular imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT can improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD and non-PD.
 * Dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands and the sympathetic innervation of the heart are popular molecular imaging tools used in clinical practice.
 * DAT SPECT abnormalities can support a diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian syndromes, but it cannot differentiate between the various types with sufficient accuracy.
 * Myocardial MIBG scintigraphy can assess the sympathetic cardiac nerve terminals in PD patients, but its test accuracy is limited.
 * A retrospective study compared the results of SPECT studies of striatal DAT receptors and myocardial MIBG scintigraphy with the clinical diagnoses in 34 patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes.
 * The study found that the combined use of DAT SPECT and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy improved the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD.",0
620,"1. A 73-year-old Korean man presented with a round nodule in the left perianal area, which was found to be a perianal infestation with the tick Amblyomma testudinarium. The patient had recently visited a rural county in South Korea and felt a pain of sting around his anus while defecating.
2. The tick was surgically removed and measured 25 mm in length and 18 mm in width, engorged with blood meal. The pedipalps had a long article II with approximately 2.5 times as long as the article III. The ornamented scutum was relatively small, and its punctuations were dark brown or brownish-black spots on a pale yellow background.
3. The skin reaction at the site where the tick had attached was intense, with a central amorphous eosinophilic material and surrounding inflammatory cell infiltrations. The epidermal defect was about 1.8 mm in width and adjacent epidermis revealed parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, and mild spongiosis.
4. The tick was identified as a female adult of A. testudinarium based on morphological characteristics. This tick is more common in the tropic areas, including Southeast Asia and the Indian peninsula. In Korea, it is distributed in Jeju Island and the southern coastal area of the mainland. This is the third reported case of human infestation of A. testudinarium in Korea.",0
621,"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy, with predominant involvement of the interventricular septum. It can be caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomere proteins, including cardiac troponin T (TNNT2).
2. Mutations in TNNT2 have been associated with a severe form of HCM, characterized by a poor overall prognosis with a high incidence of sudden death despite only mild left ventricular hypertrophy. However, the genotype-phenotype correlation of this gene still remains insufficient in Japanese familial HCM.
3. The phenotypic expression of TNNT2 mutations varies considerably, ranging from asymptomatic individuals with a normal life expectancy to those with sudden cardiac death or the need for an early heart transplant. Clinical parameters such as the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, the presence or absence of a left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and electrophysiology testing have not been predictive markers of poor prognosis.
4. Late gadolinium enhancement with cardiac magnetic resonance can be a predictive marker of the ventricular arrhythmia and poor prognosis in HCM. Genetic test-based risk stratification has been considered to be clinically informative, but the specific gene mutation cannot be the sole factor that dictates clinical phenotype. The development of a case-based method would be useful to treat and help each individual, and more attention needs to be paid toward searching for the modifier and environmental factors including diet, lifestyle, exercise, and the modification gene and polymorphism.",0
622,"1. Schistosomatidae is a family of digenetic endoparasites with complex life cycles that alternate between intermediate (freshwater gastropods) and definitive hosts (birds, reptiles, fishes, and mammals). The Schistosoma species can live in the human host for over 5 years. Schistosomiasis, caused by several Schistosoma species, is a chronic and debilitating disease and is considered a major public health issue by the World Health Organization.
2. The genomes of S. haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni have been sequenced, revealing that they carry a nuclear genome of approximately 385, 397, and 363 megabases, respectively. The genetic linkage map of S. mansoni has been obtained, allowing for gene discovery and function analysis, as well as the identification of genetic loci that determine important traits such as host specificity, virulence, and drug resistance.
3. Transcriptomic analyses have been used to study differential regulation in gene expression and the identification of splicing variants in Schistosoma. These studies have been essential in identifying gene-coding regions during the process of genome annotation and have revealed putative antischistosome candidate molecules to be used as vaccine targets. Transcriptomic studies have also been used to investigate specific tissues and life stages of Schistosoma, providing new insights into factors controlling schistosome development and immunity towards the parasite.",0
623,"1. * The study found that for patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sCLM), simultaneous resection of primary and liver tumors is a favorable strategy, but it is associated with a high morbidity rate due to greater surgical stress and longer operation time.
2. * The study aimed to determine which patients could benefit from staged resections instead of simultaneous resection by identifying predictive factors for postoperative morbidity and anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM. The study found that operation time greater than 8 hours was the only independent predictive factor for anastomotic leakage after simultaneous resection of sCLM.",0
624,"1. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the performance of daily activities and requires pharmacological treatment to achieve and maintain clinical control.
2. Inhalation is the most widely used approach for asthma treatment, allowing drugs to reach the lungs in a selective manner, increasing drug concentration in the airways, and reducing systemic adverse effects.
3. However, only half of all asthma patients use the prescribed medication correctly, and incorrect inhaler use can lead to treatment failure and difficulty in achieving clinical control.
4. The frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) ranges from 14% to 90%, with an estimated mean of 50%, reducing lung drug deposition to less than 20%.
5. Instruments that assess the difficulties patients face in using inhaled drugs might be useful to reduce those difficulties and improve treatment adherence.
6. There is no gold standard scoring system for assessing inhaler technique errors, but some instruments have been developed and used in a hospital to assess inhaler technique in patients with asthma and COPD.
7. The present study aimed to validate two scores quantifying the ability of patients to use MDIs or DPIs, identify the most common errors made during their use, and identify patients in need of an educational program for the use of these devices.
8. The study included patients diagnosed with asthma, in outpatient treatment for at least two years, between 15 and 65 years old, with at least four years of schooling, no hearing impairment, and who agreed to participate in the study. The study was conducted in three phases, including validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores, assessment of the content validity of the two scores, and assessment of the criterion validity and discriminant validity of the instruments.",0
625,"1. * Enterocin S37 is a bacteriocin produced by a strain of Enterococcus faecalis recently isolated from chicken feces, which has shown activity against foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni.* The bacteriocin is heat-stable, has a molecular weight of less than 10 kDa, and is sensitive to proteases, which suggests that it may be a Class IIa bacteriocin.* The activity of Enterocin S37 increased several folds during the purification process, and the combination of Enterocin S37 with certain K channel modulators, such as pinacidil, has shown to impact the growth of both sensitive and resistant Listeria monocytogenes strains.
2. * The antimicrobial sensitivity of a target strain to any given bacteriocin may depend on the ecological conditions under which it is grown, and variations in salt concentration, pH, the presence of membrane-disrupting molecules, or inducing cultures can have a significant impact.* The classification of Gram-positive bacteriocins is rendered difficult due to their heterogeneity, and as the number of Gram-positive bacteriocins identified has continued to increase, classification schemes have had to continuously evolve.
3. * Many Enterococcus strains from various ecosystems have been characterized as antagonists of broad range of foodborne pathogens, and the bacteriocins produced by enterococcal strains displayed heterogeneous structures and differences in their mode of action.* Most of the bacteriocin producers enterococcal strains were isolated not only from different types of food but also from broilers and animal secretions, and some of these bacteriocins exhibited high activities against broad spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-positive bacteria, like Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, and Gram-negative bacteria like Campylobacter or Salmonella, strains of medical interest.",0

- The study was conducted in compliance with various guidelines and regulations, and approval was obtained from the institutional review board.
* Twenty-eight children with spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3 were enrolled in a phase 1, open-label, escalating-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single intrathecal dose of nusinersen.
* Three lumbar punctures were scheduled during the study for drug delivery and/or follow-up collection of cerebrospinal fluid for safety and pharmacokinetic analyses.
* The majority of lumbar punctures were carried out using either a 22- (48%) or 25-gauge (37%) needle inserted in the l3-l4 (44%) or l4-l5 (29%) space.
* Nearly half (44%) of the lumbar punctures were guided using fluoroscopy.
* Of the 73 lumbar punctures performed, the majority (68%) had no complications; lumbar puncture-related adverse events were reported in 23 (32%).
* The most common adverse events were headache (9 events), back pain (9 events), and post lumbar puncture syndrome (8 events), and all events resolved without long-term complications.
* A subgroup analysis demonstrated that headache, back pain, and post lumbar puncture syndrome were observed more frequently when a 21- or 22-gauge needle was used, in older children (8 - 14 years of age), and in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3.
* The study suggests that using a 24-gauge needle or smaller atraumatic needle inserted with the bevel parallel to the dura fibers could reduce damage to the dura and decrease the risk for cerebrospinal fluid leak after lumbar puncture.",0
627," * Clinical governance (CG) is a strategy for improving quality of healthcare services.
 * The UK Department of Health introduced CG in 1997, and Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) applied it in 2009.
 * MOHME's CG model includes seven interlocking components and is based on systems awareness, leadership, ownership, teamwork, and communication.
 * CG implementation in healthcare organizations faces several barriers, such as insufficient knowledge and attitude toward CG, lack of resources, inadequate information technology systems, resistance to change, necessity of cultural change, and professional boundaries.
 * A qualitative study was conducted to capture facilitators and barriers in CG implementation from the viewpoint of curative deputies in Iranian medical universities.
 * The study's findings suggest that senior managers accept the importance of improving healthcare quality and believe that CG is a strategic goal to achieve central government targets.
 * Senior managers' knowledge and attitude toward CG, adequate resources, and a supportive culture are crucial factors affecting CG implementation.
 * Organizational commitment, effective interactions within and between departments, and embedding CG components in day-to-day work are also essential for successful CG implementation.
 * The study also identified several barriers to CG implementation, including lack of resources, resistance from medical staff, lack of support from physicians and medical staff, legal challenges, and inadequate supporting systems.
 * The authors suggest several solutions to overcome the barriers, including developing educational courses and workshops, raising staff awareness toward CG, developing a supportive culture, having all levels of staff commitment and involvement, effective communication, developing clinical guidelines, using incentive tools, and overcoming legal challenges.",0
628,"• Hydatid cyst disease is a significant zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus parasite, which is spread through contaminated viscera, water, soil, and vegetables.
• The disease is common in many parts of the world, including Iran, and is more prevalent in regions with traditional animal husbandry and close contact with animals.
• The prevalence rate of hydatid cyst in the intermediate host has been reported as 11.5%-34.6% in Iran, and the prevalence rate of human hydatid cyst has been reported as 1.1%-13.7% in different parts of the country.
• The study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical status of human hydatidosis in Khorasan Razavi province during 2011-2014, and the findings showed that the majority of patients were infected with a single cyst, and the most common clinical symptom was abdominal pain. Liver involvement was reported in 59.4% of patients, and 8.4% had multiple organ involvement. The study also found that 45.9% of individuals were in contact with dogs, and 64.4% of them washed the vegetables with water alone, indicating a need for better education on hygiene principles.",1
629,"1. * Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts (CHFCs) are rare, congenital liver cysts first described by Friedrich in 1857.
2. * CHFCs are thought to result from evagination of the foregut during embryogenesis and have specific characteristics, including four layers: pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mucus cells, sub-epithelial connective tissue, smooth muscle, and outer fibrous capsule.
3. * CHFCs are usually found in the left lobe of the liver, are mostly asymptomatic, and are typically located superficially in the median segments.
4. * CHFCs can be confused with other hepatic cysts, such as simple cysts, hydatid cysts, biliary cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, and bronchogenic cysts.
5. * The recommended treatment for CHFCs varies from observation to surgical excision, but most authors agree that cysts larger than 4-5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging lesions, and asymptomatic lesions with wall abnormalities on imaging should be surgically excised.
6. * Laparoscopic excision of CHFCs is a feasible and safe approach, but it is best suited to lesions in segments II to VI, the anterolateral portion of the liver.
7. * The subcapsular location, thick cyst wall, and benign nature of CHFCs make them amenable to laparoscopic excision with minimal morbidity.
8. * Reporting individual cases of CHFCs is important due to their rarity, and laparoscopic excision should be considered as a first-line treatment for superficially located unilocular hepatic cystic masses that present incidentally or asymptomatically.",0
630,"• The oral route is a preferred method of drug administration due to its safety, ease, and acceptability.
• Most conventional dosage forms are available as oral solid dosage forms, but low bioavailability and difficulty swallowing have led to the development of parenterals and liquid dosage forms.
• Liquid dosage forms have issues with accurate dosing and parenterals are painful, leading to patient noncompliance.
• The most popular oral dosage forms are tablets and capsules, but difficulty swallowing is a major drawback.
• Fast dissolving tablets, also known as mouth-dissolving tablets or orodispersible tablets, dissolve or disintegrate within 60 seconds without water and are absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth and gut.
• Orally dissolving strips are a more advanced form of oral solid dosage form, providing faster dissolution, higher flexibility, and better patient compliance.
• Orally dissolving strips have been developed as an alternative to fast dissolving tablets, with a faster dissolution rate, higher flexibility, and better patient compliance.
• Research is being conducted on the use of orally dissolving strips for the delivery of multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients.
• Orally dissolving strips of clobazam, a drug used to control epileptic seizures, have been developed and show improved bioavailability and palatability.",1
631,"1. * Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with the majority of survivors experiencing some degree of impairment.
2. * Recovery following stroke is complex and multidimensional, encompassing bio-medical, psychological, and sociological elements.
3. * Self-management practices by individuals with long-term conditions have been suggested as key to promoting recovery and improving health outcomes.
4. * Self-management interventions (SMIs) are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively, and their evaluation should consider whether people develop the skills to manage their own health and if this results in better health.
5. * The theoretical basis of an intervention should be established as a first step in estimating its possible outcomes, but currently, the mediators of change and theoretical premises in SMIs are unclear.
6. * The outcome measures used in SMIs should be assessed for their psychometric properties and whether they provide legitimate information to evaluate self-management.
7. * A recent international Delphi study resulted in a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties, the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist.
8. * The COSMIN list has good inter-rater agreement and reliability and represents the first critical appraisal tool that is based on the consensus of experts in psychometric theory.
9. * The current review aims to systematically examine the outcome measures adopted in stroke SMIs in terms of their methodology and the strength of their psychometric properties for use with stroke populations.
10. * The review focuses on the value of the outcome measures adopted within stroke SMIs according to their methodological quality, reliability, and validity for stroke populations, as judgments about the results and impact attributed to SMIs are dependent on valid and reliable measurement.",0
632,"1. * Osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee joint is a common cause of functional disability and reduced quality of life in older adults in India.
2. * Physiotherapists use both self-reported questionnaires and performance-based tests to monitor OA knee rehabilitation progress, with each having their own advantages and limitations.
3. * A study was conducted to examine the correlation between the self-reported Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire and the objective 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) in primary OA knee patients.
4. * The results showed weak to strong correlations between KOOS subscales and 6-MWT, BMI, and weight, while there was no correlation with age or height.
5. * The study also found that the KOOS sports and recreation subscale had the lowest mean score, while the KOOS quality of life subscale had the highest correlation with 6-MWT.
6. * These results suggest that the KOOS questionnaire can be a useful tool in assessing OA knee patients in India, but should be used in conjunction with performance-based tests for more valid results.",0
633,"1. * Obesity is a low-level, chronic inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy eating habits.
2. * Menopause, defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian function, is associated with adverse changes in lipoproteins, glucose and insulin metabolism, distribution of body fat, clotting, and vascular endothelium, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases in women.
3. * The hormonal changes during menopause are responsible for specific physical and metabolic remodeling that, when associated with weight gain and obesity, have a negative impact on women's health.
4. * A high-fat diet combined with ovariectomy may cause a decrease in energy expenditure and an increase in adipose tissue deposits, probably via enhanced uptake of triglycerides from chylomicrons. Therefore, it is essential to investigate both obesity and menopause, in particular the effects of estrogen on the inflammatory state, to improve women's quality of life.",0
634,"1. Hemoptysis is a common symptom in patients with respiratory diseases and can have a high mortality rate if massive.
2. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is a safe and effective treatment for both massive and chronic or recurrent hemoptysis.
3. A retrospective study of 344 patients who underwent BAE found that tuberculosis and bronchiectasis were the most common causes of hemoptysis.
4. The study also found that BAE was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 96% of patients, but recurrent hemoptysis occurred in 17.7% of patients within 1 month after the procedure.
5. The main responsible arteries for hemoptysis were the right bronchial artery, left bronchial artery, and combined right and left bronchial trunk.
6. The distribution and frequency of embolization of the arteries were consistent with previous studies.
7. Complications of BAE can include subintimal dissection, arterial perforation, and reflux of embolic material, as well as fever, chest pain, and dyspnea.
8. The long-term outcome of BAE may not be good in some patients, but it can be a life-saving treatment option for those who are poor surgical candidates.
9. BAE is a useful first-line treatment for hemoptysis arising from bronchial arterial sources, providing immediate bleeding control and reducing the need for surgery.",0
635,"1. Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and celiac disease (CD) can both cause lymphocytic gastritis (LG), a condition characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the stomach. However, the prevalence and contribution of these two conditions to LG is still a topic of controversy.
2. A study was conducted to investigate the relationship between HP and CD in pediatric LG by examining the gastric tissue of four groups of patients: normal controls, CD patients without HP infection, CD negative patients infected by HP, and CD patients infected by HP.
3. The study found that CD patients, regardless of HP infection status, had a higher number of IELs compared to controls. HP infected patients, regardless of CD status, had the highest number of lymphoid aggregates in the antrum.
4. The study also found that CD patients with associated HP infection showed a lower rate of LG, which might be explained by HP's limited role in cytotoxicity and its ability to converge the immune response towards a TH2 response and suppress the TH1 immune response. The study suggests that immunohistochemical analysis of CD8 lymphocytes in the antrum might help differentiate between CD and HP infection in undefined cases.",0
636,"1. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, is required for solid tumor growth and is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
2. Inhibition of angiogenesis with drugs could be an important tool in cancer treatment as it can limit tumor growth by preventing the formation of new blood vessels.
3. Anti-angiogenic treatments should have low toxicity and should not interfere with normal cell division, as angiogenesis also occurs during fetal development, menstrual cycle, and wound healing.
4. The targets of anti-angiogenic treatments are normal processes controlled by normal cells, not by tumor cells, making them less susceptible to drug resistance caused by tumor cell mutations.
5. In breast cancer, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human VEGF and prevents it from binding to its receptors, is approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2/neu-negative breast cancer.
6. Inhibition of VEGF binding to its receptors reduces tumor growth, microvessel density, and tumor-associated macrophage infiltration in breast cancer xenografts.
7. VEGF is a major chemoattractant for inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and T cells.
8. Inhibition of VEGF reduces angiogenesis and modulates immune cell infiltration of orthotopic breast cancer xenografts.
9. Angioinhibitors have been approved for the treatment of tumors and age-related macular degeneration, and are being tested in combination with conventional chemotherapy in clinical trials. Preventive angioinhibitory therapy may also be possible in the future.",0
637,"• Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common medical condition in postmenopausal women resulting from the loss of estrogen stimulation on vaginal and vulvar tissue.
• An estimated 32 million postmenopausal women in the US suffer from VVA symptoms including dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation.
• VVA is chronic, progressive, and will not resolve without treatment, and if left untreated, it can negatively impact women's quality of life, including sexual relationships and emotional well-being.
• The REVIVE survey, conducted among a large cohort of postmenopausal women in the US, highlights the poor understanding of VVA among women and concerns about the efficacy, convenience, and safety of VVA treatments.
• The survey findings emphasize the need for better communication between women and their healthcare providers (HCPs) about VVA and its treatment options.
• The survey results demonstrate that many postmenopausal women have low awareness and poor understanding of VVA and its associated symptoms, with only 25% of women specifically identifying menopause as the cause of their symptoms.
• The most commonly reported VVA symptoms among postmenopausal women are vaginal dryness (55%), dyspareunia (44%), and local irritation (37%).
• The survey findings indicate that women often do not understand that VVA is related to menopause, and effective patient education should begin with the explanation that VVA is a common medical condition associated with reduced estrogen levels after menopause.
• Healthcare providers should emphasize that OTC products do not effectively treat the underlying pathological causes of VVA and that certain prescription therapies directly improve the physical changes underlying VVA by increasing superficial cells and reducing parabasal cells and vaginal pH.",1

639,"1. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a significant predictor of coronary and cerebral vascular risk, and is commonly caused by atherosclerosis leading to narrowed arteries in the lower extremities.
2. Statins, which reduce lipid levels and have pleiotropic effects such as improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress, are often used to treat PAD.
3. A study was conducted to evaluate lipid peroxidation parameters and total antioxidant capacity in the serum of PAD patients before and after surgery, and to compare these parameters with those in a group of patients receiving simvastatin therapy.
4. The study found that PAD patients had higher concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, and enhanced oxidative stress as demonstrated by elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) compared to those treated with simvastatin.
5. The study also found that the total antioxidant capacity (expressed as FRAP) and thiol group concentrations in the serum of patients on statin therapy and in those before surgery were similar, but decreased following surgery in PAD patients.
6. The findings suggest that lipid peroxidation may be one mechanism through which several risk factors promote PAD, and support the efficacy of statin therapy in PAD.",0
640,"1. The use of herbal remedies, such as the FIJK herbal mixture, is popular in Nigeria, but there is little scientific data on their safety and efficacy.
2. A study was conducted to determine the effect of oral and repeated exposure to FIJK on rat plasma biochemical indices and liver morphology.
3. The results showed that oral administration of FIJK caused significant reductions in rat plasma protein levels and elevations in plasma triglyceride levels.
4. Additionally, the mixture decreased plasma HDL-c levels and increased plasma LDL-c levels, leading to an elevated atherogenic index.
5. The mixture also caused significant elevations in plasma ALT and AST levels, indicating potential liver toxicity.
6. The study suggests that the use of herbal remedies, including FIJK, should be regulated and subjected to scientific scrutiny to ensure safety and efficacy.",0
641,"• Autosomal recessive or X-linked disorders can be identified before pregnancy through carrier screening or carrier testing, which can benefit prospective parents by making them aware of possible genetic risks to their future offspring and the reproductive options available.
• Carrier screening is the detection of carrier status in persons who do not have an increased risk, while carrier testing is for persons who have a higher a priori risk based on personal or family history.
• Preconceptional carrier screening can be offered on an individual basis or as an organized screening program, with the goal of strengthening reproductive autonomy and informed decision-making.
• Studies have shown positive attitudes towards CF carrier screening from healthcare providers, patients, their relatives, and the general public. The NIH, ACMG, and ACOG have recommended preconceptional CF carrier screening for couples with no family history of CF.
• Traditional healthcare systems have hesitated to implement carrier screening programs for the entire population of couples planning a pregnancy due to concerns such as psychological impact, risk of stigmatization/discrimination, impairment of freedom of choice, medicalization, difficulty in reaching couples before conception, and provider-related barriers.
• Commercial companies have started offering preconceptional carrier tests directly to consumers, providing information about monogenic diseases and the risk of having affected offspring. These direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests have created a debate about their desirability.
• DTC testing for preconceptional carrier tests for autosomal recessive disorders raises ethical issues, such as the informed consent procedure, medical supervision and follow-up, and the appropriate use of existing resources.
• The current offer of preconceptional carrier tests through online providers, such as DNA Direct, DNA Traits, Pathway Genomics, 23andMe, and Counsyl, varies in the types of tests and information provided. The health council of the Netherlands emphasizes the need for criteria for a responsible offer of genetic DTC screening.",1

2. * The text also explores the debate around removal of asymptomatic hardware after fracture union, citing potential benefits like functional improvement and pain relief, but also challenges such as surgical complications.
3. * The authors conducted a study on patients admitted for removal of implants in an orthopedics department, finding that the most common reasons for removal were pain, discomfort, or prominent hardware, infected hardware, and implant failure.",0
643," * Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve atrophy.
 
 * Multiple factors are related to glaucoma, including high intraocular pressure (IOP) and low cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
 
 * Müller cells, the major type of glial cells in the mammalian retina, support and nourish retinal neurons, maintain extracellular ion homeostasis, and are involved in retinal function.
 
 * Reactive Müller cells can aggravate retinal damage by releasing cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-).
 
 * Increased glial production of TNF- contributes to the neurodegeneration in glaucoma.
 
 * -Aminoadipic acid (AAA), a six-carbon homolog of glutamate, induces specific glial toxicity through blocking the glutamate uptake.
 
 * The current study aimed to determine if AAA treatment inhibits Müller cell gliosis and protects against retinal abnormalities induced in a rat model of acute ocular hypertension (AOH) mimicking glaucoma.
 
 * The study found that AAA treatment rescued RGCs from the cell apoptosis induced in the AOH model and protected against AOH-induced RGC death through modulating Müller cell gliosis.",0
644,"1. Endoscopic resection of nonampullary duodenal superficial neoplastic lesions (SDNs) is challenging due to the risk of severe adverse events (SAEs) such as delayed perforation.
2. Surgical treatment often results in extensive resections, causing significant morbidity.
3. A new technique called laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with ligation device (LAEFR-L) has been developed to treat nonampullary SDNs.
4. LAEFR-L is a minimally invasive procedure that prevents exposure of the abdominal cavity to malignant cells during resection.
5. From June 2015 to September 2015, 5 patients underwent resection of nonampullary SDNs using LAEFR-L.
6. Complete resection was achieved in all cases, and no complications were reported.
7. LAEFR-L has two advantages over conventional full-thickness resection (FTR) procedures: it allows for intraluminal collection of the resected specimen, avoiding contact with the peritoneum, and it does not require proficient experience in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (ESD).
8. Tumor size and location are important factors to consider when determining the indication for LAEFR-L. Lesions smaller than 15 mm in diameter and not close to the ampulla of Vater may be candidates for this procedure.",0
645,"1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by defects in various enzymes necessary for cortisol synthesis, with 90-95% of cases caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). This results in some precursors being shunted into the androgen synthetic pathway, causing signs and symptoms of androgen excess.
2. The discovery of cortisone in the 1950s has led to effective management of CAH, with typical medical treatment consisting of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies and suppress adrenal androgens. However, recent reports reveal a high prevalence of small adrenal tumors in patients with untreated 21-OHD CAH.
3. Two of four cases of patients diagnosed with CAH and managed with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone developed adrenal masses, with two undergoing adrenalectomy due to increasing mass size and virilization.
4. The development of adrenal adenoma or carcinoma in patients with CAH is rare, but the incidence of adrenal masses appears to be higher in CAH patients and in heterozygotes than in the general population. The pathogenesis of adrenal tumor in patients with 21-OHD CAH is thought to be related to a consequence of ACTH hypersecretion, which results from the lack of glucocorticoid synthesis. Patients with 21-OHD CAH should maintain steroid medication to avoid the appearance of adrenal tumor, improve its symptoms, and normalize electrolyte disorder, particularly hyponatremia.",0
646,"• Self-rated health (SRH) has been validated as a tool to predict mortality and functional ability, and is often measured by asking participants to describe their overall health on a five-point scale.
• Low fruits and vegetables intake, high fat intake, and low physical activity have been associated with poor SRH and an increased risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.
• A study of adults in Miami-Dade County, Florida found that modifiable lifestyle behaviors such as low fruits and vegetables intake and high fat intake were associated with poor SRH in both males and females, while low physical activity was significantly associated with poor SRH in females only.
• The study had limitations such as the inability to establish causality and the lack of data on other factors that may influence SRH, such as socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors.",1
647,"1. Endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) has become a popular alternative to open surgery for treating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children, with high success rates reported in some studies. However, the success rates vary widely and can be as low as 55%. At the institution where the study was conducted, the overall radiographic success rate for patients and renal units after the first injection was 75% and 84%, respectively.
2. The study compared two different techniques for performing positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography: a high-pressure cystogram and a standard PIC cystogram. The study found no statistically significant difference between the two techniques in detecting de novo contralateral VUR in the case of preoperative unilateral VUR. The study also found that performing PIC cystography intraoperatively immediately after Dx/HA injection could not predict a successful surgical outcome.
3. The study found that a negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative vcug in only 80%. Therefore, the addition of intraoperative cystograms cannot replace postoperative studies. However, PIC cystography can detect occult reflux and prevent postoperative contralateral new onset of VUR in patients treated with unilateral VUR.",0
648,"1. * The accuracy of ultrasound in detecting fetal pathology depends on the sonographer's expertise and is affected by certain limitations, such as fetal head descent, skull bone ossification, maternal obesity, and oligohydramnios.
2. * Fetal MRI has an increasing role in diagnosing prenatal anomalies, particularly in cases of ventriculomegaly, due to advancements in MRI technology and better knowledge of fetal pathology. MRI can provide excellent contrast resolution, directly visualize the cortical region and the fossa posterior, and detect additional cerebral anomalies. However, its major limitations include the impact of fetal motion and lower spatial resolution compared to ultrasound.",0
649," • Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the US, with 226,160 new cases and 160,340 deaths expected in 2012.
• Bone is a common site of metastasis in lung cancer patients, and these bone metastases can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe pain.
• These SREs can significantly impair mobility and reduce quality of life in lung cancer patients, adding to the overall burden of the disease.
• A study was conducted to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and SREs on mortality among older lung cancer patients by analyzing a combined population-based cancer registry and Medicare claims database.
• The study found that having a bone metastasis was associated with increased mortality in lung cancer patients, but there was no additional effect of SREs on mortality among patients with bone metastasis.
• The study had some limitations, including the lack of validation of the procedures used to identify bone metastasis and the absence of information on functional status of patients, which is a predictor of outcomes.",1
650,"1. The study found that different smear layer removal methods from root canal dentin affect the bond strength of a fiber post cemented with adhesive resin to dentin. The higher bond strength results were obtained for the photodynamic diode laser and 37% orthophosphoric acid groups.
2. The smear layer produced by post space preparation should be removed for increased antibacterial effects and adhesive effectiveness. However, the study found that the photodynamic diode laser group showed higher bond strength than the other groups except for the 37% orthophosphoric acid group without the removal of smear layer.
3. The study suggests that it may be more effective to modify the smear layer when a self-adhesive system is used. Naocl (5.25%) and naci (0.9%) were not effective in removing the smear layer when used as a final irrigation. Orthophosphoric acid (37%) and edta (17%) were more effective methods in removing the smear layer than naocl, naci irrigants, and the photodynamic diode laser. However, the photodynamic diode laser and orthophosphoric acid were more effective at the cement-dentin interface than edta for bond strength of self-adhesive cements.",0

2. * The Human Microbiome Project in the USA and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) consortium in Europe are two major initiatives aimed at characterizing the microbial communities that inhabit multiple sites in the human body.
3. * Collaborations to investigate if there is a common core of bacterial species shared among all or the majority of human beings have also been initiated, resulting in the discovery of a common core of bacterial species in the human gut.
4. * The composition of the bacterial flora in the human gut is strongly dependent on the main nutritional source, with distinct bacterial profiles for omnivores, carnivores, and herbivores.
5. * Recent studies have shown that the human gut flora belongs mainly to two phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with a smaller representation of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria.
6. * The diversity of archaea in the human gut is but a fraction of the expansiveness of the bacterial species colonizing the gut, but it has been argued that archaea may yet contribute to the health status of the human gut.
7. * The composition of the bacterial flora in the human gut seems to strongly depend on the environment and the maternal input during delivery and upon breast feeding.
8. * The largest amount of variability between the gut bacterial flora can be explained by intersubject differences, and recent second generation, high throughput studies have revealed more details about the human bacterial communities.",0
652,"1. * Tazarotene, a topical drug commonly used for nail psoriasis, has been found to be effective in treating distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis in an open preliminary study of immunocompetent patients.
2. * The study reported that mycological cure was observed in subungual samples collected at the first follow-up visit in 40% of patients, and complete cure with complete clinical healing in all patients was observed at the end point.
3. * The fungistatic activity of tazarotene in vitro was investigated by disk diffusion assay, which documented the inhibition of the growth of T. mentagrophytes, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and T. verrucosum.
4. * The study also found that tazarotene can reduce hyperkeratinization in fungus-infected nails, which is beneficial in treating onychomycosis.
5. * The authors suggest that tazarotene could be useful in treating treatment-resistant forms of onychomycosis or those with enhanced nail thickening, but further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in terms of relapse and reinfection.",0
653,"1. Cardiac resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is an important treatment for heart failure and left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, but clinical non-response is reported in 25-35% of patients.
2. The study aimed to assess the acute haemodynamic response (AHR) of the implanted system and alternative LV endocardial pacing sites in patients clinically not responding to CRT.
3. The study included 24 patients who remained in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV despite at least 6 months of CRT and adequate medical therapy.
4. The results showed that in 5 out of the 9 acute haemodynamic non-responders with left bundle branch block (LBBB), the AHR could be increased above the 15% level by LV endocardial pacing.
5. The average AHR with the coronary sinus system was 9.6% (5.8-14.9%), and at the LV endocardial optimal position, it was 25.8% (19.0-34.3%).
6. The study concluded that endocardial LV pacing, guided by acute haemodynamic studies, could improve clinical outcome in patients not responding to conventional CRT, and the clinical response improved with a posterolateral position of the lead instead of the original apical or anterolateral lead location.",0
654,"• Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity.
• The disease may not show symptoms until the third or fourth decade of life, and only about half of patients will progress to renal failure.
• In young patients, there is no way to predict whether or when renal failure will develop, but several risk factors such as hypertension, renal hemorrhage, multiple pregnancies, male gender, and pkd1 disease genotype have been associated with a more rapid course.
• Complications associated with pregnant subjects with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis include maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, anemia, infected renal and hepatic cysts, pyelonephritis, and rupture of cerebral artery aneurysm during labor with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
• Spinal anesthesia can be safely performed for cesarean section in patients undergoing hemodialysis with careful and effective perioperative monitoring.
• An 80 kg 35-year-old full-term primigravida with oligohydramnios and ADPKD was scheduled for an emergency lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) and was hospitalized and hemodialyzed for two months to maintain blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and potassium values within acceptable limits.
• The patient was given spinal anesthesia in the L3-4 intervertebral space using 1 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (5 mg) with 25 mcg fentanyl in the left-lateral position with a 25 g spinal needle.
• The patient maintained normal hemodynamic and biochemical parameters postoperatively and did not require any hemodialysis.
• Pregnancy can exacerbate renal disease, and the pathophysiology is unknown. One hypothesis is that increased glomerular perfusion which normally accompanies pregnancy paradoxically causes further injury to the kidneys in patients with preexisting impairment of function.

655,"1. The study used data from 733 Karan Fries cows to analyze the fortnightly test-day milk yield (ftdmy) and its relationship to mastitis and parity.
2. The ftdmy was less in the first fortnight and increased gradually to peak in the third or fourth fortnight before declining steadily with advancement of lactation.
3. The ftdmy was generally higher in normal cows compared to mastitis cows, with the highest yield observed in the fourth parity.
4. The peak milk yield was attained earlier in subsequent parities compared to the first parity in both normal and mastitis cows.
5. The gamma type function was found to be a good model for predicting milk yield in both normal and mastitis cows, with a high coefficient of determination of variation and low root mean square error.
6. The study also found that the ftdmy and lactation curve parameters were affected by the incidence of mastitis, with a significant decline in yield (p < 0.01) but no effect on peak yield duration.",0
656," • The study found that ndga consumption in mice was associated with an increase in multiple tumor types and hemorrhagic diathesis, even at doses below its therapeutic dose. However, ndga extended the lifespan of drosophila, suggesting that its target(s) and mechanism(s) of action may be phylogenetically conserved.
 • The study found that the doses of ndga which extend murine lifespan appear to overlap the dosages which produce serious pathologies. In humans, the consumption of dietary supplements containing creosote leaf and stem extracts, which includes ndga, resulted in toxic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fulminant liver failure.
 • The study suggests that ndga reduces tumor growth rates but increases tumor formation. Inhibition of IGF-1R signaling can enhance rodent lifespan, but the response is sex and background dependent. Reduced IGF-1R activity alone is unlikely to be the major mechanism by which ndga extends murine lifespan.
 • The study found that ndga produces molecular damage at its optimum dosage for increasing lifespan, as evinced by the induction of cancers and modest liver and kidney toxicity in humans and mice. The study also suggests that the less toxic derivatives of ndga, such as tetra-o-methyl nordihydroguaiaretic acid, may also be capable of extending murine and drosophila lifespan.",0
657," • Genetic variation contributes to disease susceptibility and treatment response.
• Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the discovery of genetic variants contributing to complex genetic diseases and detection of pharmacogenetic markers.
• Personalized medicine aims to improve medical decision-making by promoting the identification of the optimal drug and dosage for a subgroup of patients, as well as situations of withholding treatment, preventive interventions, or targeted treatment options for individual patients.
• Biomarkers are diversely defined and can be measured in biospecimen, with a specific association with a health or clinical outcome.
• DNA biomarkers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), short tandem repeats (STRs), deletions, insertions, or other variation on the DNA sequence level, are stable over an individual's lifetime and can be used in both prospective and retrospective studies.
• Current applications of biomarkers in personalized medicine include diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction, with examples such as EGFR mutation testing in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to determine whether first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is indicated.
• The development of diagnostic tests undergoes a similar process as drug development, with phases I-IV establishing safety, technical properties, validation, and clinical outcome improvement, respectively.",1
658," * Myosin VA (Myova) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton.
 
 * Myova is made up of a pair of motor domains (heads), lever arms, a coiled-coil rod domain, and a cargo-binding domain.
 
 * Myova's movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following ATP hydrolysis, which is amplified by the lever arms to result in the motor's processive motion.
 
 * Calcium is required to activate the ATPase activity of Myova, but high calcium concentrations reduce motor processivity and can cause one or more calmodulins to dissociate from the lever arm, reducing the efficiency of the lever arm displacement amplification and the strain-dependent gating between the two heads.
 
 * Myova is able to maneuver through actin intersections and travel along actin bundles in vitro.
 
 * Myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to allow the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search, which may be facilitated by structural domains within the lever arms or at the lever arm/coiled-coil junction.
 
 * Tethered particle microscopy (TPM) was used to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual Myova motors and their subdomains.
 
 * The flexural stiffness of Myova subdomains was defined by TPM, and the results suggest that the lever arm/rod junction must be highly compliant to allow Myova to avoid intracellular obstacles and efficiently deliver cargo in vivo.
 
 * The potential for alterations in the lever arm stiffness with changes in intracellular calcium may provide a measure of tunability in regulating cargo transport and delivery linked to changes in the cell's ionic environment.",0

- A study was conducted to determine if clinical outcome after surgical resection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could be predicted by functional polymorphisms in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
- Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP73 genes were genotyped in a cohort of 346 esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent.
- In multivariate analysis, patients with EAC carrying the heterozygous MDM2 (rs2279744) t/g genotype had significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients carrying the wild-type t/t genotype.
- Patients with EAC harboring the homozygous CDH1 (rs5030625) ga/ga genotype had a significantly reduced survival as compared with patients carrying the wild-type g/g genotype.
- The study suggests that inter-individual differences in germ-line DNA have an impact on DFS in patients with EAC.
- The true drivers of clinical and biological diversity in esophageal cancer include the molecular aberrations of the cancer and the genetic make-up of the patient.
- SNPs in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can potentially alter the risk for metastatic or aggressive tumor, resulting in differences in clinical outcome.
- Altered expression of the AURKA, ERBB2, MDM2, CDH1, CDKN2A, and TP7",0

661,"• Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and it primarily spreads through the lymphatic system to locoregional lymph nodes. The status of these lymph nodes is crucial for staging the disease and determining prognosis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with the combined technique of radioisotope and blue dye is the standard method for determining axillary staging in early-stage breast cancer patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla. However, the use of radioisotopes has drawbacks, such as stringent regulations on training of staff and handling and disposal of radioactive material, and limited access in many hospitals worldwide.

• A magnetic tracer and a handheld magnetometer have been evaluated as a radiation-free alternative to the combined technique. A superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) tracer was administered interstitially in the breast, followed by identification of the SLNs with a handheld magnetometer. The magnetic technique was found to be noninferior to the combined technique with identification rates of 94.4%-98.0%. However, there was a discordance in SLNs identified between the magnetic and combined techniques, potentially leading to false-negative staging with the magnetic technique. The use of different-sized SPIO-based formulations has been evaluated to optimize the clinical application of the magnetic technique for SLNB, and the 59 nm tracer has been found to be the best performing magnetic nanoparticle tracer, approved for human use, in SLNB with a handheld magnetometer.",1

2. * Higher plasma vaspin concentrations are found in men with the metabolic syndrome and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to those without the metabolic syndrome or normal glucose tolerance. However, serum vaspin levels are negatively correlated with creatinine levels and are significantly reduced in Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients.
3. * A study was conducted to measure serum vaspin and adiponectin levels in subjects with normal renal function and renal insufficiency with or without T2DM and to compare various clinical parameters. The study found that serum vaspin levels were lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic individuals, regardless of renal function.
4. * Multiple regression analyses showed that the level of HbA1c was independently and significantly associated with the vaspin concentration in all subjects. The level of CrCL was found to be independently and significantly associated with the adiponectin concentration in all subjects. The serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were both higher in women than in men.",0
663,"1. Data from two clinical trials were used to test surrogate variables for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and explore the correlation between granulation tissue development and complete healing.
2. The trials involved patients with Wagner grade 3 or 4 DFUs larger than 1 cm, treated with intralesional injections of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (RHEGF) or placebo, in addition to standard care.
3. The main efficacy variable was granulation tissue development, with a median time to complete closure of 15 weeks.
4. Surrogate markers of complete healing were generated, including percent change in area, log healing rate, and ratio of log areas at the 2nd week and end of treatment (EOT).
5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated for each candidate surrogate variable to evaluate its capacity and quality of discrimination among individuals.
6. The most efficient predictor of healing was the granulation tissue covering > 75% of the ulcer area at the EOT, with 79.5% correct classification and a high negative predictive value.

664,"1. * The study compares the perioperative surgical trauma and its postoperative impact on the abdominal wall between two advanced minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, Needlescopic Transabdominal Preperitoneal (NTAPP) repair and Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) Transabdominal Preperitoneal (STAPP) repair.
2. * The results show that NTAPP repair has a significantly shorter operative time, smaller umbilical skin incision length, and less immediate postoperative pain compared to STAPP repair. However, both procedures have similar long-term results in hernia recurrence, abdominal wall mobility, and cosmetic satisfaction.
3. * The study suggests that the NTAPP procedure with smaller caliber trocars can further minimize surgical trauma to the abdominal wall tissue and offer distinct advantages in the immediate postoperative phase in reduced postoperative wound pain and shorter sick leave. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the benefits of needlescopic surgery.",0

2. * The study also found that TAA was associated with the absence of dyslipidemia, while abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was significantly associated with the presence of dyslipidemia. This suggests that the etiology of AA may differ between the ascending and descending aorta.
3. * The study reported a low prevalence of AAA in an Asian population and reinforced the impact of smoking on AAA. The results highlight the need to clearly define the usefulness of routine screening for AAA among Asian non-smokers.

671,"1. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with the highest incidence rates in Europe and North America. Mammography is the most commonly performed procedure for breast cancer detection, with digital mammography (DM) being more commonly used in the US due to its advantages over screen-film mammography.
2. DM has slightly higher sensitivity than screen-film mammography and is less likely to be lost or damaged. However, it still has limitations, such as false positives and the potential for tumors to be obscured by overlapping tissue, especially in women with dense breast tissue.
3. Tomosynthesis, also known as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), is a 3-D mammography technique that may help solve the problem of overlapping tissue and improve tumor detection. Newer prospective population-screening trials have provided more definitive results on the use of DBT.
4. Radiation exposure is a concern with mammography, but newer digital systems have been developed to reduce doses, such as a specific digital system using slot scanning with a photon-counting detector that eliminates scatter radiation and improves noise reduction and image quality.
5. False positives are a recurrent criticism of mammography, leading to unnecessary recalls and biopsies. DBT has been shown to reduce recall rates and increase cancer detection, particularly in women with dense breast tissue.
6. DBT has all the advantages of DM, such as fewer artifacts, consistent quality, and digital image processing. It can also eliminate the need for additional mammogram images and send patients directly to ultrasound without further mammography.
7. Synthetically reconstructed 2-D images can be made from DBT data, eliminating the need for double exposures and reducing the radiation dose to that of conventional mammography. Radiologist interpretation time is longer for DBT, but this may be offset by decreased recall rates and decreased need for additional views. The cost of a DBT system is greater than that of a DM system, but it is still a relatively low-cost innovation compared to breast MRI. DBT is undergoing further technological changes and is a focus of clinical research trials.",0

 • Diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine, is classified as an antitussive in the US FDA OTC monograph and has been shown to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in healthy volunteers and in those with chronic cough.
 
 • A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a diphenhydramine-containing multicomponent syrup, compared with a dextromethorphan-containing syrup and placebo, on cough reflex sensitivity in otherwise healthy subjects with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI).
 
 • The study found that diphenhydramine-containing medication significantly increased cough reflex sensitivity compared to placebo, while dextromethorphan did not.
 
 • The diphenhydramine-containing syrup proved to be a more effective antitussive than dextromethorphan, but the timing of the cough challenge may not have allowed for the maximal antitussive effect of dextromethorphan.
 
 • The study contributes the initial evidence demonstrating the ability of diphenhydramine to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in acute pathological cough, but further clinical trials are needed to evaluate this and other OTC cough and cold products.",0
673," * The global population is getting older, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Aging is a decreased ability to resist cellular stresses or insults and is a major cardiovascular risk factor.
 
 * The endothelium, which forms a monolayer that lines blood vessels, has a primary role in adjusting vascular function. Alterations in the control of endothelial processes often lead to atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as functional alterations in endothelial physiology, characterized by a reduction of vasodilator substance output and augmentation in endothelium-derived contracting factors.
 
 * Oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of oxidizing agents and opposing antioxidant systems, interferes with endothelial function by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. This reduction is due to the rapid inactivation of NO by superoxide anions produced in the aging vascular wall. Oxidative stress also causes inflammation, which directly triggers vascular dysfunction.
 
 * Exercise has been shown to improve endothelial function and restore NO availability, thereby slowing down age-related losses in endothelial function. Exercise training also upregulates antioxidant defense mechanisms and increases repair mechanisms for oxidative damage.
 
 * Aging is an important independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, which is manifest as endothelial dysfunction. Reduced NO bioavailability, decreased responsiveness to other endothelial-derived vasodilators, vascular oxidative stress, and inflammation are prominent features of the aging process that promote a vasoconstrictive, hypercoagulative, and proliferative state, favoring the development of atherosclerosis. Exercise training can prevent and restore age-related impairment of endothelial function by restoring NO availability and alleviating inflammatory processes.",0
674," • Axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast carcinoma, and worsens with an increasing number of metastatic lymph nodes.
• The number of metastatic lymph nodes depends on the number of removed lymph nodes, and it is difficult to assess axillary lymph node status reliably without removing sufficient numbers of lymph nodes.
• Recent studies suggest that the lymph node ratio (LNR) provides more useful prognostic information compared to nodal disease classification based on the number of metastatic lymph nodes.
• The LNR threshold value that separates patients into two prognostic groups with significantly different survival rates varies in different studies, and it is greater in series excluding n1 disease.
• Identifying a separate LNR threshold value for each n disease group may be useful in predicting prognosis in breast carcinoma patients with axillary metastatic lymph node(s).
• LNR is a more powerful prognostic factor than the number of metastatic lymph nodes and can be used to separate n1 disease patients into low- and high-risk prognostic groups for distant metastasis development.
• LNR is a useful tool in standardizing adjuvant therapy for patients operated in hospitals with different axillary dissection width and median number of removed lymph nodes, and in drawing reliable comparisons between treatment results coming from such different hospitals.",1

676,"1. Non-native biological invasions have caused significant environmental damage for centuries, such as the Phylloxera destroying grapevines in Europe and chestnut blight in North America.
2. Charles Elton's book on invasions in 1957 did not spark widespread research or policy response, but an international project in the mid-1980s led to increased research on the ecological and economic impacts of invasions.
3. Recent research has shown that impacts of invasions can occur at the ecosystem level, affecting nutrient cycles, fire cycles, and hydrology, and can subtly alter physical structures of ecosystems, affecting many resident species.
4. Molecular genetic research has revealed a great number of cases of hybridization and introgression between introduced and native species, leading to substantial evolution of native species and even the creation of new, more invasive species.
5. Genetic techniques are used to trace sources and routes of invasions, and introduced populations often combine genes from multiple source populations, producing novel genetic combinations.
6. The ""invasional meltdown"" phenomenon has been increasingly observed, where two or more introduced species facilitate each other's establishment or enhance each other's impact on native species.
7. Lag effects have been detected, where the full-fledged widespread establishment and impact of an introduced species lags for years behind initial arrival.
8. Critics of invasion biology argue that the problems are overblown, that introduced species can increase native biodiversity, that antipathy toward introduced species is xenophobic, that it is a hopeless battle to slow the spread of invasions, and that the methods used to combat invasive species are inhumane.
9. However, the majority of introduced species have not been studied, and modern invasion biology is very new, making it difficult to determine their impacts. Ecosystem impacts can be subtle and take a long time to manifest.
10. Preventing invasions or reversing/mitigating their impacts is possible through biosecurity measures, early detection and rapid response, and eradication or maintenance management methods. Incremental improvements in techniques are leading to higher success rates and fewer non-target impacts.",0

678," * Posterior transpedicular pedicle screw fixation is commonly used for managing unstable spines, often caused by trauma or burst fractures.
* Transpedicular short-segment fixation has been beneficial in managing thoracolumbar spinal fractures, but can be associated with loss of reduction and instrumentation failure.
* The use of intermediate screws in conjunction with short-segment fixation has been found to improve biomechanical stability, restore lordosis, and prevent screw breakage.
* A calf experimental model was used to compare the stiffness of a short-segment pedicle fixation using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws placed at the level of a burst fracture.
* The results showed that the addition of an intermediate screw decreased the range of motion (ROM) of the spine, indicating enhanced stability.
* The use of intermediate screws provided a smaller ROM in both the monoaxial and polyaxial groups, and increased stiffness in injured spines as compared to intact spines.
* The study suggests that the use of intermediate screws with posterior short-segment fixation, especially with monoaxial screws, provides a biomechanical rationale for managing unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region.",1

683,"• Inter-individual variations in ex vivo platelet aggregation during clopidogrel therapy have been correlated to reduced exposure of active clopidogrel thiol metabolite and differences in p2y12 receptor occupancy.
• High platelet reactivity during therapy with clopidogrel and low platelet inhibition are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting, in particular stent thrombosis.
• Carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 (cyp2c19) nonfunctional alleles have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary stenting.
• Clopidogrel undergoes two steps of bioactivation: first, oxidation to 2-oxo-clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes; then, in the second step, thiol metabolite is generated.
• A recent study suggested a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 (PON1) as the rate-limiting enzyme in the second step of clopidogrel biotransformation.
• A common polymorphism of PON1 (q192r) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq (aa) haplotype, and has been associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients with coronary stenting.
• A genome-wide association study (GWAS) did not find evidence of a significant association of SNPs located on or near the PON1 gene with variation in platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.

The patient in this case experienced medically intractable seizures caused by mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), which was confirmed through various diagnostic tests including EEG and neuroimaging. The patient's MTLE was determined to be caused by hippocampal sclerosis (HS), a common finding in MTLE.

• The text also discusses the possible mechanisms for how congenital toxoplasmosis may contribute to the development of HS and MTLE. One possibility is that the seizures caused by a calcified nodule in the brain due to toxoplasmosis may lead to the development of HS through the kindling phenomenon, a process in which repeated low-level stimuli result in seizure development. Another possibility is that the inflammatory reaction and resulting gliosis around the calcified nodule may impact the hippocampus and contribute to the development of HS. The text emphasizes the importance of comprehensive evaluation and careful management of seizures in patients with congenital toxoplasmosis, particularly those with calcifications in the perihippocampal area.",1

2. A 1992 National Institutes of Health conference concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers substantial advantages over traditional open cholecystectomy with similar morbidity and mortality rates.
3. A retrospective review of 70 cholecystectomy patients found that converted laparoscopic cholecystectomies had significantly higher charges ($19,922 vs. $13,042) compared to open cholecystectomies, with the difference attributed to laparoscopy charges.
4. Decision tree and sensitivity analyses showed that open cholecystectomy was more cost-effective, but if charges for laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be reduced to certain levels, it would become cost-effective.
5. Healthcare providers should evaluate cholecystectomy-related charges and conversion rates to improve cost-efficiency, reduce mortality and morbidity, and remain competitive in the market.
6. Matched-pair comparisons, decision tree, and sensitivity analyses can help institutions evaluate and modify their procedures to become cost-efficient in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",0
686,"• The study found that partial remission (PR) or ""honeymoon period"" in type 1 diabetes patients is characterized by a reduction in daily insulin requirements and improved disease control. The definition of PR has been revised based on insulin-dose-adjusted A1C (IDAA1C) levels, which show a strong correlation with stimulated C-peptide levels. The underlying mechanisms of PR are largely unknown, but restoration of residual beta-cell mass activity in an insulin-sensitive environment is believed to play a role.

• The study found that PR occurred in 56.2% of patients with type 1 diabetes, without any case of complete remission. The absence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis was significantly associated with a higher frequency of PR, particularly in boys. Lower A1C levels at diagnosis were also associated with a higher chance of PR, particularly in girls. The duration of PR was not impacted by A1C levels at diagnosis, but patients with PR had better metabolic control up to 3 years after diagnosis.

• The study did not find a correlation between PR and long-term type 1 diabetes evolution, including metabolic control and complications, or occurrence of severe hypoglycemia. However, the study had low numbers of events, and a short-term effect of PR on metabolic control was suggested in patients with PR durations between 510 and 570 days.

 * The prevalence of oral lesions in the elderly population differs according to various factors such as socioeconomic differences, medical and dental history, treatment expenditure, and handicap.
 * A study was conducted to find the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions in 5,100 geriatric patients in India.
 * Of the 5,100 patients, 3,264 patients (64%) presented with various oral lesions, with males being more affected than females.
 * The most commonly diagnosed lesions were nicotinic stomatitis (43%) due to tobacco use and denture stomatitis (34%) due to long use of prostheses.
 * The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions was found to be higher in older patients than in the younger population.
 * The study also found that 110 patients (2%) were diagnosed as having malignancies, all of whom were diagnosed as having squamous cell carcinoma.",0
688,"1. A patient with a history of chronic hearing loss and trismus was misdiagnosed with otitis media and a temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) disorder, leading to unnecessary treatments and a delay in appropriate treatment for a rare chondroblastoma with malignant potential in the temporal bone.
2. The study emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis, especially for a mass in the temporal bone, as tumors such as chondroblastoma can become malignant under inappropriate treatment. A total en bloc excision should be the first choice for treating chondroblastoma in the temporal bone, but accurate, early-stage diagnosis is crucial due to the difficulty of surgical resection in later-stage cases.",0
689," • Regular structured exercise has well-documented benefits for cardiovascular and metabolic function, reducing the risk of chronic health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
• Exercise alone reduces visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic lipid, which are independently associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk.
• It is unclear whether increased levels of habitual activity and reduced sedentary behavior have similar health benefits in reducing adipose tissue depots.
• Higher levels of physical activity and lower levels of sedentary behavior are associated with lower levels of visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic lipid, but this association is not straightforward.
• Objectively measured physical activity is not greatly predictive of risk at an individual level, and the associations between habitual physical activity levels, sedentary behavior, and metabolically detrimental fat depots remain uncertain.
• Regular structured physical activity reduces visceral adiposity and intrahepatic lipid, reflecting current physical activity guidelines that advocate structured exercise for health benefits.",1
690,"1. The source is a retrospective case series of fireworks-related ocular injuries during the Diwali festival over five years in a tertiary eye care hospital in North India. The study included 53 eyes of 45 patients, with most injuries affecting the right eye and occurring in males. The severity of ocular damage was greater in those who ignited the fireworks themselves.
2. The majority of the injuries were closed-globe injuries, but five eyes had open-globe injuries. Eighteen eyes underwent surgical management, with corneal and scleral tear repair, cataract extraction, and pars plana vitrectomy being the most common procedures. Five eyes developed phthisis bulbi, and one eye was enucleated.
3. The study highlights the extent of ocular morbidity and visual loss due to firecracker injuries, with three children having no light perception and 10 children having vision worse than 3/60 in the injured eye.
4. The study suggests that immediate measures such as prohibiting the manufacture and sale of dangerous fireworks, public awareness about the possible dangers, prophylactic measures, and expert primary ophthalmic care are required to reduce ocular morbidity and noise pollution caused by firecrackers. Firework displays at public places by professionals should be encouraged during Diwali and other major celebrations.",0
691,"1. * Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common disorder characterized by an isolated elevation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with a normal free thyroxine (FT4) level, and is considered to represent early, mild thyroid failure.
2. * The clinical significance and optimal treatment of SCH are controversial, and are confounded by controversies regarding the correct upper limit of the reference range for serum TSH. The treatment of SCH is typically considered only for pregnant women, infertile individuals, those with symptoms, or those at high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism.
3. * The prevalence of SCH varies according to population, age, sex, race, region, and method of TSH measurement, and is defined as a TSH level greater than 4.0 to 6.0 miu/l. The prevalence of SCH is relatively high and ranges from 4% to 20% in the adult population.
4. * Higher levels of TSH are associated with an increased BMI, worsening blood pressure (BP), and altered lipid levels. SCH is also associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.
5. * The impact of SCH on the cardiovascular (CV) system has recently become an important topic of research, and SCH can lead to impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function and an increased risk of incident heart failure in older individuals with a high CV risk.
6. * The European Commission has funded a trial, the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) study, to assess the multimodal effects of thyroid hormone replacement in 3,000 adults 65 years of age and older with persistent SCH. This trial will evaluate CV events, disease-specific and health-related quality of life, muscle function, and cognitive function.",0
692," * The anaerobic, gram-positive bacillus Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
  * Antimicrobial drugs can disrupt the normal intestinal flora, allowing C. difficile to flourish and release toxins that induce C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).
  * Diagnosis of CDAD widely uses an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B released by the C. difficile cells.
  * However, the low detection sensitivity of EIA for the CD toxins has been reported, and there is currently no definite method of determining whether diarrhea is caused by CD toxins present at concentrations below the detection sensitivity of EIA in patients with EIA toxin-negative stool or whether diarrhea is due to a cause other than CD toxins.
  * If EIA testing is performed on C. difficile isolates cultured from the same specimen, an EIA GDH-positive and toxin-negative stool specimen may give a toxin-positive result.
  * Bacterial content is higher in specimens containing colonies in solution compared to stool, and therefore toxin concentration may also be markedly higher.
  * If a specimen is GDH positive, follow-up testing with a nucleic acid amplification test, such as PCR, is recommended to compensate for the low sensitivity of EIA.
  * The present study investigated patients who had submitted stool specimens for CDAD diagnosis using EIA and found that patients with toxin-negative stool may be dismissed as non-CDAD and thus overlooked in terms of treatment and infection countermeasures.
  * The study also found that patients who tested positive for C. difficile on culture but negative for toxins in their stool had milder symptoms, despite having toxin-positive isolates.",0
693,"1. * The DREAM trial was a large, international, multicenter study designed to determine if ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with IFG or IGT.
2. * The trial found that participants who received rosiglitazone had a significant increase in insulin secretion and a significant decrease in proinsulin to c-peptide ratio compared to those who received a placebo. There was no significant change in these measures for participants who received ramipril versus placebo.
3. * After adjusting for age and insulin resistance, rosiglitazone significantly increased insulin secretion and reduced proinsulin concentrations over time compared to placebo. Ramipril did not have a significant effect on these measures.
4. * After accounting for baseline -cell function, rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes, but adjusting for the change in -cell function attenuated this preventive effect.
5. * The study suggests that rosiglitazone, but not ramipril, improved measures of -cell function over time in people with IFG and/or IGT, and that some but not all of the effect of rosiglitazone on diabetes prevention/delay is mediated through its effects on -cell function.",0
694,"1. Microbial communities differ from monocultures in terms of the toxins they degrade, natural products they produce, and their capacity to grow in certain environments. A complete understanding of microbial metabolism must consider both individual strains in pure culture and the combinatorial interactions supported by complex communities.
2. Interacting partners in microbial communities share metabolites such as hydrogen, acetate, amino acids, fixed nitrogen, or glucose. The dynamics of these interactions can be extrapolated from the individual characteristics of the participating strains.
3. A general model of metabolic interaction would account for the variety of metabolites that can be exchanged and the genotypic diversity of the strains that exchange them, without requiring detailed biochemical characterization of each individual participant.
4. Optimization-based techniques of flux balance analysis have been successful in describing metabolic systems. These approaches can be extended to higher-order systems of multiple strains in coculture.
5. Certain pairs of auxotrophic E. coli strains can complement one another's growth in minimal media by cross-feeding essential metabolites, a relationship referred to as synthetic mutualism in trans (SMIT).
6. The SMIT interactions constitute a class of synthetic genetic interactions, reflecting and elucidating the genetic and metabolic network from which they derive.
7. A quantitative and predictive theoretical model can reveal the extent to which complex metabolic interactions emerge from the relatively simple topology of the biochemical reaction network.
8. The study of SMIT interactions can identify biosynthetic modules and detect more distal correspondence in the metabolic network, providing insights into the emergent phenotype of microbial communities.",0
695," • Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome (BSS) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by the progressive formation of adnexal skin tumors, such as trichoepitheliomas, cylindromas, and spiradenomas, due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CYLD on chromosome 16q12q1",0
696,"1. * Biological scaffold materials derived from dermis, pericardium, and small intestine submucosa of human, bovine, and porcine origin have been used in soft tissue repair applications such as hernia repair, breast reconstruction, staple-line reinforcement, and orthopedic applications. These scaffold materials are particularly useful in clean-contaminated or contaminated settings due to their rapid revascularization and clearance of bacteria.
2. * Absorbable polymer scaffolds, such as Dexon and Vicryl, have been developed and used primarily in damage control situations. However, these scaffolds lose mechanical strength and are resorbed fairly quickly, making them less than ideal for hernia repair applications which require more long-term support of the repair site until tissue remodeling is complete.
3. * More recent absorbable scaffold designs, such as Gore Bio-A, Tigr Matrix, and Phasix Mesh, utilize long-lasting polymers that degrade more slowly. These scaffolds have been evaluated in animal studies and clinical trials, with promising outcomes for hernia repair applications. However, larger, more comprehensive clinical trials are needed to fully understand the long-term capabilities of these scaffolds.",0
697,"• Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, mediated by van genes, has been a significant issue in healthcare for over 25 years, with vanA and vanB being the most prevalent.
• In Denmark, there has been a dramatic increase in vanA-positive Enterococcus faecium infections since 2012 due to multiclonal outbreaks.
• Current guidelines recommend screening patients at risk and implementing isolation precautions for VRE carriers, using selective culturing and/or PCR detection of vanA or vanB genes.
• A study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert vanA/vanB assay and its impact on infection control decision-making in a Danish laboratory serving a population of 800,000 inhabitants.
• The laboratory implemented the Xpert vanA/vanB assay in autumn 2014 to manage long-lasting VRE outbreaks, providing results within an hour.
• The study compares the Xpert vanA/vanB assay with the culture-based method and PCR for detecting vanA and vanB genes, reporting sensitivities ranging from 43.5% to 100% and specificities from 79.2% to 99.6%.
• The study found that the Xpert vanA/vanB assay saved 141 isolation days and 292 transmission risk days, but also resulted in six additional transmission risk days and 13 additional isolation days due to false-negative or false-positive PCR results.
• The authors emphasize the importance of considering psychosocial consequences of VRE outbreak situations and isolation precautions for patients and staff members.
• The study received non-financial support from Roche Diagnostics a/s and MSD, and the authors contributed to the conception, design, data acquisition, analysis, and manuscript drafting.",1
698,"1. * The study found that aldosterone antagonism, either alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), is effective in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in both normal and diabetic hearts.
2. * The study showed that treatment with an MR antagonist (ru) was generally better in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts compared to treatment with an ACEi (capt) or ARB (los) alone. However, in diabetic hearts, ru was generally similarly effective as capt or los treatment.
3. * Dual therapies involving ru were similarly effective as capt + los therapy, whereas triple combination was generally equal to or the most effective strategy in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal or diabetic hearts.
4. * The study found that the relative improvement in cardiac function or effectiveness of RAAS blockers was greater in diabetes than in control hearts, with the exception of pmax for ru given after ischemia.
5. * The study suggests that MR signaling is detrimental for all cardiac parameters in nondiabetic hearts during ischemia as well as reperfusion phases, whereas in diabetic hearts, at least for pmax, it may be detrimental only during the ischemia-induced phase of I/R injury.
6. * The study showed that ru importantly improves diastolic function (as measured by dp/dt) in diabetes, especially when given after ischemia, and thus early-stage ru treatment may represent a novel strategy for treating diabetes-induced diastolic dysfunction.
7. * The study suggests that optimal usage of drug(s) alone or in combination may require their selection based on several criteria, including their relative benefit in the normal versus pathological state, whether being considered for prevention or treatment strategy, on the specific cardiac parameter that might need to be improved, and on the optimal rate of cardiac function recovery required for a given condition.",0

- Modern nasal surgery aims to improve both the cosmetic appearance and natural functions of the nose.
- Acoustic rhinometry is a common method used to measure nasal cavity geometry, and it has shown a close correlation with rhinomanometry measurements.
- Nasal cavity dimensions have significant associations with nasal airflow.
- The study evaluates changes in nasal dimensions of healthy Iranian volunteers for cosmetic rhinoplasty using acoustic rhinometry.
- The study found that right d1, bilateral d2, and left mca2 did not change significantly after surgery without a decongestant, while bilateral d1, bilateral d2, and both mca2 decreased significantly with a decongestant.

700,"1. * Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in many economically developed nations, accounting for about 30% of all deaths. Its incidence is still increasing, and ongoing research aims to investigate and prevent the early development of cardiovascular risk factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.
2. * The beneficial effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been proven in several observational and experimental studies. The lipid lowering action of n-3 PUFAs was detected at the beginning, and they were used for the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders. Their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiarrhythmogenic effects were observed later.
3. * Atherosclerosis is now considered a systemic disease featured by low-grade arterial inflammatory lesions that can develop through the disease progression. In physiological conditions, endothelial cells synthesize and release adequate amounts of nitric oxide and prostaglandins and maintain a downstream balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules. However, in the presence of atherosclerosis, this balance disrupts, leading towards an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, with further progression of the disease.
4. * N-3 PUFAs and their eicosanoid derivatives may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response. The two PUFAs families, omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, differ in location of the last double bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule. The human body can produce almost all fatty acids, except linoleic acid (LA, c18:2 n-6, precursor to the n-6 series of fatty acids) and -linoleic acid (ALA, c18:3n-3, precursor to the n-3 series of fatty acids). These two PUFAs are named essential fatty acids because the body cannot synthesize them.

701,"1. * The understanding of H. pylori-induced inflammation leading to cancer is based on the work of three pioneering pathologists: Rudolf Virchow, Pelayo Correa, and Robin Warren.
2. * Virchow is considered the father of modern pathology and first proposed the idea that cancer arises from initially normal cells in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. Examples of inflammation-induced cancers include acid reflux-induced esophageal adenocarcinoma and inflammatory bowel disease-associated colon cancer.
3. * Correa developed a model for gastric cancer development, hypothesizing that the development of the more common intestinal subtype of gastric cancer results from a stepwise process beginning with chronic atrophic gastritis and progressing to intestinal metaplasia and cancer over the next 30-50 years.
4. * Warren, along with Barry Marshall, discovered H. pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. They were aware of the relationship between gastritis and cancer and speculated that H. pylori may have a part to play in gastric cancer.
5. * H. pylori infection is a definite (group 1) carcinogen and is a significant risk factor for both intestinal and diffuse-type gastric cancer. H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk of developing gastric cancer.",0
702,"• Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NAMD) is a leading cause of visual loss among the elderly population. Before the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, only prevention of visual acuity loss could be achieved in a limited number of patients with different treatment options.
• Intravitreal treatments with bevacizumab and ranibizumab have led to the majority of patients preventing baseline visual acuity loss and achieving visual improvement in some patients. Multicenter studies and comparative studies have shown that both drugs are effective in preventing visual acuity loss and improving visual acuity in up to 40% of patients.
• A study comparing the functional and anatomical outcomes of bevacizumab therapy to ranibizumab therapy on an as-needed treatment regimen for NAMD in Turkish patients found no significant difference between the two groups in regards to change in visual acuity and central retinal thickness at all time points.
• Both groups had similar mean injection numbers, baseline intraocular pressure, and complication rates. The study found that both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were effective in stabilizing visual acuity in NAMD patients after 12 months of follow-up.",1
703,"• Severe hypoproteinemia (SHP) in preeclampsia (PE) is associated with increased risk of poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, including cesarean section (CS), severe hypertension, abnormal liver or renal function, ascites, and abruptio placenta. The percentage of CS in SHP was 93.7%, and the incidence of abnormal liver or renal function in SHP was significantly higher than in mild hypoproteinemia (MHP). SHP PE is also associated with a higher risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes than MHP PE, deserving closer surveillance during pregnancy.

• The pathophysiologic mechanisms of PE are unclear, but it is believed that defects in placental implantation and function ultimately display as the development of PE. SHP in PE indicates that the conditions are further exacerbated, affecting the function of various organs. Placental vascular spasm in PE increases blood flow resistance from mother to the fetus, resulting in chronic fetal hypoxia, which can lead to intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight. Women with SHP PE were more likely to deliver preterm infants and have lower average birth weight and fetal growth restriction than those with MHP PE.",1
704,"1. * The development of the VEGF-A monoclonal antibody, Avastin, has been successful in treating various human cancers such as colorectal, lung, and renal cell carcinoma. However, its recent withdrawal for treating breast cancer in the US highlights the limitations of anti-angiogenic treatments and the need for careful cost-benefit analysis.
2. * Other growth factors, such as VEGF-C, VEGF-D, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Placental Growth Factor (PIGF), may promote resistance to Avastin and contribute to tumor angiogenesis. The role of these growth factors in cancer is context-dependent and may vary based on the presence of other VEGF family members or the diverse expression of VEGF receptors on various cell types.
3. * During the past 20 years, various agents have been developed to modify or inhibit VEGF signaling pathways, including VEGF-A inhibitors, VEGF receptor inhibitors, PTK inhibitors, and transcription factor inhibitors. Other VEGF family members have also been identified, increasing the diversity of signaling induced by the VEGF family of ligands. Agents specifically targeting VEGF family members and their receptors are currently in various stages of development, and a key challenge will be identifying specific cancer indications in which clinical benefit can be achieved.",0

2. * The study found three asymptomatic P. vivax infections that were missed by both microscopy and RDT. These cases were only detected by nested-PCR using specific primers.
3. * The study highlights the importance of using molecular methods, such as nested-PCR, in addition to microscopy and RDT for active case surveillance in endemic settings to improve sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for malaria detection and prevention of re-introduction.",0
706," * Over the last two decades, new immunotherapy approaches to cancer treatment have been developed due to increased understanding of the immune system and how tumors can circumvent it.
* Some of these investigations have led to approved agents for standard clinical use, such as infusional cytokine therapies, intravesical BCG therapy, and an active cellular therapy for advanced metastatic prostate cancer.
* Other agents have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials and are expected to be approved, such as a monoclonal antibody targeting a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor for advanced melanoma.
* To be clinically approved, these treatments must demonstrate safety and positive impact on patient care and outcome.
* Some agents may be best used in combination with other immune-activating or conventional therapies, but this presents challenges for clinical development and evaluation.
* Identifying markers of biological response, ideally associated with clinical outcome, is needed to evaluate these agents used in combination.
* For antigen-specific vaccines, it has been relatively straightforward to evaluate immune responses to the target antigen as a biomarker of immunological efficacy. However, there are few instances in which target antigen immune response has been associated with clinical benefit.
* Appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive for broadly active immune modulating agents such as anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies or TLR agonists.
* Studies with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have sought to identify whether amplification of other T-cell costimulatory molecules or antibodies to defined antigenic tumor-associated proteins might be useful as biomarkers.
* For whole cell tumor vaccines where there is not a specific defined antigen being targeted, surrogate antigens known to be expressed by the tumor vaccine have been used as a means of monitoring immune responses from the vaccine.",1
707,"1. Bone mass density and architecture are dependent on mechanical factors, and cell mechanical stimulation promotes proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic lineage.
2. Stress shielding can cause bone loss through remodeling due to decreased loading, and solutions such as design variations and controlled-stiffness implants have been proposed.
3. A new approach is the development of smart implants that integrate systems for bone mechanical stimulation using the converse piezoelectric effect.
4. An in vivo study was conducted using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films as a substrate for MC3T3 cells to explore the concept of using piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect for osteoblast mechanical stimulation.
5. The study found that total bone area was significantly higher around actuated devices compared to static controls, and the increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation.
6. The study also found that the mineral apposition rate was significantly higher around actuated devices, and there was a marked elevation in osteopontin (OPN) detection around actuators.
7. The results suggest that the generated strains were enough to elicit a response, and the increased OPN expression was most likely associated with mechanical stress.
8. The study highlights the need for further studies to evaluate accurately the bone-material interface and the possible effects of the material and electrical current if coating damage occurs.
9. The study suggests that piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect may be used to effectively stimulate bone growth at the bone implant interface, but new materials with better biocompatibility should be developed.",0
708,"1. The study found that serum L-fucose levels are directly indicative of the degree of tissue destruction in oral cancer and can be used as a biochemical indicator of cancer detection, staging, therapeutic success, prognosis, and posttreatment evaluation. However, further investigation on a large scale is needed to prove its effectiveness as a tumor marker in the diagnosis and management of oral cancer.
2. L-fucose is a monosaccharide that is important in many signaling pathways and is increased in cancer and other diseases. Fucosylation of glycoproteins, the addition of L-fucose at the terminal end of the oligosaccharide chain, is one of the most important features that mediate several specific biologic functions. Tumor cells alter their surface by increasing fucosylation levels to escape recognition, which contributes to numerous abnormal characteristics of tumor cells such as decreased adhesion and uncontrolled tumor growth.",0

4. Adipose cells were isolated and adipose cell size was determined using a Beckman Coulter Multisizer III.
5. LCN2 mice gained more body weight and increased adiposity, particularly when fed an HFD or aged.
6. Food intake and energy expenditure were not significantly different between wild-type and LCN2 mice.
7. LCN2 mice displayed cold sensitivity and could not survive when exposed to cold temperatures for extended periods.
8. LCN2 mice expressed significantly lower levels of UCP-1 and PGC-1 genes in brown adipose tissue, leading to decreased thermogenic capacity.
9. LCN2 mice had decreased insulin sensitivity and increased hepatic glucose production, leading to fasting hyperglycemia.",0
710," * Twenty-two male Wistar rats were obtained and divided into two groups: weight-bearing (WB) and non-weight-bearing (NWB).
  * Both groups were given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone injections to induce non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).
  * The WB group was allowed to move freely in their cages, while the NWB group had their hindlimbs unloaded using a tail suspension system.
  * The femoral and humeral heads were harvested, fixed, decalcified, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess ONFH.
  * ONFH was defined as the presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic osteocyte nuclei in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis.
  * Seven of the 11 WB rats and six of the 11 NWB rats developed ONFH, with no significant difference between the two groups.
  * Both WB and NWB rats showed diffuse presence of empty lacunae in the bone trabeculae and surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis.
  * The humeral head of both WB and NWB rats appeared normal, with no signs of ONFH.
  * The study suggests that weight bearing is not related to the development of non-traumatic ONFH in rats, but the rat model may not be useful for observing the mechanism of femoral head collapse.
  * The aetiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of non-traumatic ONFH remain unclear.",0
711,"1. * Nurses are underengaged in health policy processes due to lack of awareness of policy issues and processes, inadequate knowledge and skills, and limited opportunities to contribute to policy decisions. This is partly attributed to gender differences in the healthcare system, with nursing being predominantly viewed as a woman's occupation and men more likely to be in positions of power and decision-making.
2. * Studies have emphasized that nurses can engage in policy processes directly by assuming formal leadership positions and indirectly through lobbying and advocacy with policy-makers via professional organizations. However, nurses have not been adequately supported to generate evidence to inform policy decisions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where they have inadequate training and mentoring in research.
3. * A critical theory perspective was applied to examine how nurses had been involved in national health policy processes in Kenya, eliciting the perspectives of nurses and decision-makers working at various levels of the healthcare system. The study found that nurses were not adequately involved in policy development processes, with limited participation in all stages of policy development and poor communication of policies from the national level.
4. * The study suggests that to enhance nurses' engagement in policy processes, there is a need to strengthen their research abilities, establish mechanisms for their views to reach national level decision-makers, and develop leadership and advocacy skills within nursing. Nurses should also unite to build a strong voice to advocate for improvements in national policies that affect their work and quality of care.",0
712,"1. The study found that among 73 neonates with urinary tract infections (UTIs) admitted to the neonatal division of Bahrami Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran between 2004 and 2012, E. coli was the most prevalent organism (64.4%). Other isolated organisms included enterobacter (19.2%), klebsiella (13.7%), and S. epidermidis (2.7%). No cases of proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, S. aureus, or enterococcus were found.
2. E. coli was found to be mostly resistant to ampicillin (93.6%), cefixime (85.7%), and cephalexin (77.3%). However, it was most susceptible to cefotaxime (63.6%), norfloxacin (100%), and ciprofloxacin (100%). Enterobacter was highly resistant to amikacin (100%) and ampicillin (92.8%), but sensitive to ceftazidime (100%) and norfloxacin (100%). Klebsiella and S. epidermidis were completely resistant to ampicillin.
3. The study found that UTIs in neonates were mostly caused by gram-negative bacteria (95.8%). This finding is consistent with most past studies. However, the study did not find any cases of proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, or S. aureus, which have been reported in previous national studies. The authors emphasize the importance of continuous assessment of uropathogen epidemiology in the neonatal period, as UTIs can be hard to diagnose and can potentially lead to systemic infection with life-threatening and long-term sequelae. The authors also suggest that clinicians should consider the prevailing antibiotic sensitivities of local bacterial isolates before opting for an empirical regimen.",0
713," • Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders that cause a deficiency in an adrenal enzyme, leading to altered cortisol and aldosterone secretion. The most frequent CAH variant, accounting for 95% of all affected patients, is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), caused by inactivating mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2).
• The study investigates the frequency of white matter changes and temporal lobe structures dysgenesis in patients with CAH due to 21-OHD. The study included 26 patients with a mean age of 27.4 ± 8.2 years, who were followed at the department of endocrinology in Mahdia and Sfax, Tunisia. The diagnosis of CAH was based on clinical and biochemical criteria, including elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and androstenedione, and the ACTH stimulation test.
• The study found that eleven patients (42.3%) showed MRI abnormalities, including white matter hyperintensities, moderate right temporal lobe atrophy, globular hippocampus, partially empty sella, and cortico-subcortical atrophy associated with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Chronic hyperandrogenism due to non-compliance with treatment may be the main mechanism involved in the genesis of brain MRI abnormalities.
• The study suggests that hormonal imbalance during brain development and corticosteroid treatment could contribute to brain MRI abnormalities in CAH patients. More extensive studies are required to define better the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens.",1
714,"1. The human genome sequencing project has led to the need for biologists to become skilled at analyzing genomic DNA data, which can appear featureless but contains rich information about gene function.
2. Different scientific communities may define ""gene function"" differently, so universal vocabularies are needed to facilitate communication and collaboration.
3. Genes can be annotated (assigned names and functions) through experimental characterization or by predicting evolutionary relationships.
4. Homologous genes (those that have a common ancestor) often have similar tertiary structures and functions, so identifying homologs can help predict gene function.
5. However, homology is not a perfect indicator of function, as homologs may have different molecular mechanisms or non-homologous genes may have overlapping functions.
6. Gene annotation is currently limited to a minority of human genes, but the use of domain resources such as Pfam and InterPro can help predict the functions of uncharacterized genes.

716,"1. * Stem cells in the lung have been identified and characterized by their role in airway repair and injury response, with functional tenets including self-renewal, proliferation, and multipotency.
* Recent studies suggest that deregulation of this stem cell-based repair mechanism may be related to the earliest stages of lung malignancies, and that lung cancer stem cells may play a key role in lung tumorigenesis. These stem-like cells have the ability to rapidly proliferate into phenotypically diverse progeny, express high levels of anti-apoptotic and drug-resistant proteins, and may explain why chemotherapy is frequently ineffective against localized recurrence and metastatic disease.",0
717,"• The study evaluates the impact of urethral plate characters, such as shape and width, on the success of tip urethroplasty for managing primary anterior penile hypospadias in 100 children. The study found that patients with a urethral plate wider than 8 mm (group A) had a significantly lower fistula rate and fewer failed 8 fr calibrations compared to patients with a urethral plate narrower than 8 mm (group B).

• The study also found that patients with a flat urethral plate had a higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibrations compared to patients with a cleft or deeply grooved urethral plate, although not statistically significant. The study suggests that urethral plate augmentation with a buccal mucosal graft (BMG) may improve results in patients with a narrow and inelastic urethral plate. The study concludes that tip urethroplasty has good cosmetic and functional results and can be used for primary anterior penile hypospadias, but plates that are flat may need augmentation by BMG to improve results.",1
718," * The study aimed to develop a prototype to measure the bracket debonding force in vivo and assess its accuracy and precision.
  * A polypropylene plier was modified to include a strain gauge, an electronic circuit, and a specific software for recording the bracket debonding force.
  * The prototype was calibrated using weights ranging from 0.5 kg to 6 kg, and a simple linear regression analysis was applied to adjust the data.
  * The accuracy and precision of the prototype were measured using weights of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 kg, and the measurements were taken by two examiners who did not standardize the position of their hands on the pliers.
  * The exposed enamel surface was lightly abraded with #600 grain silicon carbide abrasive paper in a polisher to obtain a flat enamel surface.
  * The maxillary central incisor brackets were bonded to the enamel using a specific procedure, and the specimens were stored in 100% relative humidity at 37°C for 24 hours.
  * After storage, the specimens were divided into two equal groups: group 1 (bracket debonding with the prototype) and group 2 (bracket debonding by tensile testing in a universal testing machine).
  * The bracket debonding force was recorded by the software in kgf, transformed into newtons, and divided by the bracket area to obtain resistance values in mpa.
  * The prototype showed no significant difference in the mean bond strength obtained in group 1 (2.96 mpa) and group 2 (3.08 mpa).
  * The prototype was found to be a safe method for preserving the enamel surface, as the composite resin remained completely bonded to the enamel after bracket debonding.",0
719,"1. * The study found that Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection was more prevalent in older women, those with less education, single women, women who reported unprotected sex with a nonsteady partner, and women who reported multiple sex partners in socially-marginalized young women from low-income communities in coastal Peru.
2. * The study highlights the importance of screening and treatment programs for TV infection, as it is often asymptomatic and can contribute to long-term prevalent infection, continued spread, and adverse reproductive health outcomes. The screening and treatment of sex partners of infected women should also be prioritized as a public health measure to prevent reinfection and reduce infection prevalence and complications in untreated males. Further studies are needed to determine if screening and treatment of TV will improve the reproductive health and birth outcomes of women.",0
720," * Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by specific types of seizures, EEG patterns, and cognitive impairment.
 
 * LGS is difficult to treat, with many drugs reducing seizures initially but losing effectiveness over time, leading to polypharmacy and cumulative side effects.
 
 * Diagnosing LGS can be challenging due to heterogeneous causes and variable clinical and EEG features.
 
 * A few randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have shown that felbamate, lamotrigine, and topiramate reduced the occurrence of atonic and tonic-clonic seizures in children with LGS.
 
 * Valproic acid is considered the most useful initial medication for drop attacks, atypical absences, and myoclonic seizures in LGS, although caution is needed in children under 2 years old.
 
 * Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, was granted orphan drug status for the adjunctive treatment of LGS in the US and is approved for treatment of LGS in children 4 years of age and older.
 
 * Rufinamide's mechanism of action involves decreased firing of high-frequency sodium-dependent action potentials and prolongation of sodium channel inactivation.
 
 * Rufinamide has a wide spectrum of anticonvulsant effectiveness in animals and a good safety profile in animals and humans, with minimal cognitive side effects.
 
 * Rufinamide is well absorbed orally, has low protein binding, and is eliminated primarily via metabolism, with a low plasma binding rate suggesting minimal drug-drug interactions. However, careful elucidation of drug-drug interactions is necessary in conditions like LGS, where polypharmacy is usual.",0
721," * Interpopulational variation in sexual chemical signals may contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation in many animals.
 * Phenotypic plasticity in sexual signals can lead to signal divergence in different environments, which can be amplified by sexual selection and lead to differences in mating preferences.
 * In the Iberian wall lizard (Podarcis hispanica), chemical compounds secreted by the femoral gland of males convey information about social status and genetic quality.
 * Researchers hypothesized that interpopulational variations in femoral gland secretions within P. hispanica might lead to reproductive isolation and promote speciation processes.
 * They studied five distinct populations of Iberian wall lizards in central Spain, which live in close proximity without geographical barriers but maintain distinct morphotypes and genetic differences.
 * The researchers analyzed the morphological characteristics, chemical compounds in femoral gland secretions, and chemosensory recognition abilities of these lizards.
 * They found significant differences in morphology, femoral gland secretions, and chemosensory recognition between the populations.
 * The results suggest that there could be premating reproductive isolation between some, but not all, populations of this lizard.

723," * Rubella infection during early stages of pregnancy has a 90% potential of passing through the placenta and reaching the fetus.
 * Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is a major complication of rubella, and can be prevented through vaccination of susceptible people or women in reproductive age.
 * The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent CRS, which affects an estimated 110,000 infants each year in developing countries.
 * The most commonly used rubella vaccine globally is derived from the Ra27/3 virus strain, which provides more immunity and has a similar immune response to natural infection.
 * In Iran, the rubella and mumps vaccines were added to the national vaccination plan in 2003, resulting in a decrease in the appearance of measles and rubella for less than one case per million.
 * A study in Kermanshah, Iran, found a significant increase in immunity against rubella in vaccinated versus unvaccinated girls (99.3% vs 79.6%).
 * The study also found a highly significant decrease in the rate of negative antibody from 20.42% to 0.7% after mass vaccination.
 * It is proposed that studies on the immunity status against tetanus, diphtheria, and other diseases be conducted regularly, and that vaccination of vulnerable society members be made if necessary.",0
724," • The use of cell type specific molecular markers and gene-specific RNA probes has enabled the description and analysis of developmental morphogenesis in various biological systems.
• Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) is a common technique used to visualize gene expression patterns by detecting RNA transcripts in whole mounts, but its uses are diverse and include medical and prenatal diagnostics.
• The use of fluorescent methods for detecting transcripts has several advantages over chromogenic methods, such as higher quality three-dimensional imaging, multiplexing different RNA species, and covisualization of RNA with proteins.
• Quantum dots (QDS), a new type of inorganic fluorophore, have ideal optical properties for use in biology, including strong fluorescent signal emission, wide excitation spectra, narrow and tunable emission spectra, large separation between the excitation and emission, and resistance to photobleaching.
• QDS have been used for in situ hybridization in clinical biopsies for the detection of multiple mRNAs with successful conjugation to oligonucleotide probes.
• The use of QDS for detecting multiple mRNAs in WISH protocols and their high fluorescence intensity make them a potential candidate for RNA detection in whole embryos.
• However, previous efforts to use QDS for fish experiments have met with aggregation issues and were time-consuming, and studies have pointed out difficulties in using QDS for fish experiments, including steric hindrance, degradation of QD conjugates, and adherence to tubes and tips.",1

• The majority of pancreatic cancer cases are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has the most aggressive tumor biology and metastatic potential.
• Demographic and clinical factors significantly impact the survival of PDAC patients, with surgical resection having the most dramatic influence.
• Two new Cox regression models were developed to estimate survival for patients with resectable and unresectable PDAC, and an interactive online clinical calculator was created.
• The calculator has limitations, such as the absence of standard errors and reliability/generalizability checks, making its clinical use uncertain.
• A web-based prognostic tool was developed using SEER data and Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for various covariates, to estimate survival and conditional survival probabilities.
• The tool's reliability and generalizability were proven by its calibration and discrimination abilities, and it is available for clinical practice.",1

• The diagnosis and management of CLI were based on the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) or its revised consensus (TASC II).
• PTA was the first-choice procedure for revascularization, except in cases of heavily calcified or diffusely occluded lesions.
• Major amputation was indicated when revascularization failed to relieve patients from rest pain or control their foot lesions.
• Preoperative variables considered in the analyses included sex, age, activities of daily living (ADLs), Fontaine stage, infection, diabetic condition, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, receiving regular hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.
• Diabetic condition was determined as the presence of diabetes in the whole population and as a glycemic control in the diabetic population.
• The presence of diabetes was independently associated with major amputation, while mortality was associated with age, impaired ADLs, hemodialysis, and serum albumin level.
• In the diabetic population, a1c level was independently associated with major amputation, with a 1% increment in a1c level increasing the risk of major amputation by 34.9%.
• The two higher a1c quartiles of the diabetic group had a significantly higher risk of major amputation than the nondiabetic group.
• Diabetes with a1c 6.8%, infection, and hemodialysis were significantly associated with major amputation in the diabetic population.",1
727,"1. Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a widespread parasitic zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus.
2. Humans get infected by accidentally ingesting E. granulosus eggs found in the feces of infected dogs.
3. CE in humans often presents with fluid-filled cysts in the liver, lungs, or other organs.
4. Diagnosis is usually established through radiology and serology.
5. Postsurgical relapses or treatment failure can occur due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material.
6. A follow-up method for prognostically determining the efficacy of CE treatment should include markers for detecting newly growing or relapsing cysts and tracking previously undetected but still viable cysts.
7. Serology has been used for post-operative control of hydatidosis, but the long persistence of anti-E. granulosus antibodies makes relapse diagnosis difficult.
8. New antigens are being studied to specifically classify patients into cured and noncured categories.
9. The study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for CE serologic diagnosis and determined the diagnostic performance of Western blot.
10. The results suggest that antibodies against proteins of 24 and 39 kDa can serve as good markers for post-surgical monitoring, as they disappear in post-operative samples of cured patients.",0
728," * Obesity is a common metabolic disease worldwide and is often associated with dyslipidemias.
 * Obesity is commonly assessed using parameters such as BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.
 * Newer obesity indices, such as waist-to-height ratio, visceral adiposity index, and body adiposity index, are being studied for their potential role in assessing metabolic complications and cardiovascular risk in obese patients.
 * A study was conducted to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices and serum lipid levels in obese non-diabetic patients.
 * The study included 66 patients with a mean age of 55.8 years and a BMI of 30 kg/m^2 or higher, and excluded patients with certain medical conditions or those taking medications that could impact appetite or weight.
 * Patients were divided into three groups based on their obesity level: class I obesity (BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m^2), class II obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m^2), and class III obesity (BMI 40 kg/m^2 or higher).
 * The study found that patients with class III obesity had lower mean serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels compared to patients with class I obesity.
 * Negative correlations were found between BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and HDL cholesterol, while positive correlations were found between waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and TG/HDL cholesterol ratio.
 * The study also found that the vai index, which includes both HDL cholesterol and TG levels, demonstrated the strongest correlation with TG and HDL cholesterol levels and with lipid indices such as TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and TG/HDL-C.

730,"1. The frequency response of resonators was measured using a downmixing method, which involves electrostatically actuating the device and applying a driving voltage to a side-gate parallel to the resonator.
2. To reduce parasitic signals, the drive signal was set to half the actuation frequency, causing the amplitude of motion of the resonator to be proportional to the square of the actuation voltage.
3. A bias voltage was used to down-mix the resistance change of the gauges, and the low-frequency readout signal was detected using a lock-in amplifier.
4. Measurements were taken in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10 mbar and at room temperature, with thermomechanical noise measured using the same setup with the drive electrode disconnected.
5. The allan deviation was measured in open-loop configuration and the frequency stability was extracted from the response of the resonator actuated at resonance frequency with a fixed driving frequency.
6. The phase of the measured signal was monitored and transformed into frequency fluctuations using the phase response of the resonator.
7. Correlation measurements were performed by simultaneously measuring the response of the resonator at different frequencies within the resonator's bandwidth.
8. The phase traces were converted to frequency traces corresponding to different integration times, and the correlation of these frequency traces was calculated and plotted versus the integration time. The correlation was processed so that it only depends on frequency variations with characteristic time close to the integration time.",0

• Aspirin therapy can reduce the risk of major CVD events, and is recommended for primary and secondary prevention of CVD by the US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association.
• A study analyzing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2012 found that among adults aged 40 and older, only 31.5% reported being recommended by their doctor to take aspirin for primary prevention of CVD.
• The study also found that education level, insurance status, and having a regular source of care were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention among all primary prevention patients.
• Among high-risk individuals, age, health insurance, and being of Asian/other descent were predictive of receiving a recommendation for aspirin for CVD prevention.

  * A recent study described the periprostatic nerve distribution and constructed a 3-dimensional model
  * The study found that nerve fibers are distributed evenly around the prostatic capsule, except in the ventral part
  * The ventral part of the prostate has fewer and thinner nerve fibers
  * The three-dimensional model revealed an absence of a cord-like neurovascular bundle in the ventral part
  * Recent studies have challenged the traditional knowledge of the neurovascular bundle and its distribution
</summary>

* The number of periprostatic nerve fibers is distributed evenly on both lateral and dorsal (rectal) parts from base to apex of the prostate without forming any cord-like structures
* The number of nerve fibers on the ventral part is few in comparison, so an excessive high up incision over 2, 10 o'clock on the ventral part of the prostate is insignificant during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.",0
742,"1. * The study found that serum saa concentration was high above normal in the vast majority of ra patients, with only <10% of patients having normal saa levels. Elevated saa levels were found not only in patients with high disease activity but also in those with low or moderate disease activity, suggesting that sustained inflammation persists in most ra patients.
2. * The study demonstrated a direct relationship between saa and ra activity, with significantly higher saa associated with current treatment with gcs and women treated with biological dmards having significantly lower saa concentration than women treated only with synthetic dmards. The mean saa level was significantly higher in patients with plaques and increased cys-c level, indicating the risk of cv and renal involvement in the course of ra.
3. * The study also found that persistently elevated saa concentration increases the risk of amyloidosis development due to deposition of amyloid proteins in different tissues and organs. The saa level correlated with clinical disease activity and may be produced by rheumatoid synovial tissue, inducing cell growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and migration of cells, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, saa may play a pathogenic role locally in joint destruction and cartilage damage.",0

2. * Chronic stimulation of eosinophil production (eosinopoiesis) is an important feature of human and murine asthma, and can be regulated by lymphocyte populations in nonsensitized subjects.
3. * Endogenous glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone, play a critical role in the hematological response to allergen challenge in an allergic asthma model, and can also induce short-term bone marrow eosinophilia in response to mild surgical trauma.
4. * Perforin deficiency presents a selective defect in granulocyte production, which can be corrected by wild-type lymphocyte transfer.
5. * The ability of lymphocyte preparations to reconstitute responses to dexamethasone is abolished by depletion of CD4+ and/or CD8+ cells before transfer, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved for eosinophils and neutrophils.
6. * Lymphocyte transfer restored the short-term response to dexamethasone but did not bring the baseline counts of eosinophils and neutrophils to the same level of the b6 controls, suggesting that steady-state granulopoiesis and response to dexamethasone may be unrelated processes.",0
744,"1. India has a high number of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, with 62.4 million reported cases.
2. Fear of hypoglycaemia and weight gain are common barriers to insulin therapy initiation.
3. Modern insulin analogues offer a convenient approach to glycaemic control, with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and favourable weight changes.
4. The A1chieve study, a 24-week non-interventional study, assessed the safety and effectiveness of insulin analogues in T2DM patients in routine clinical care.
5. The majority of patients started on or switched to biphasic insulin aspart, while others used insulin detemir, insulin aspart, basal insulin plus insulin aspart, or other insulin combinations.
6. After 24 weeks of treatment, hypoglycaemic events reduced in both insulin-naive and insulin user groups, and blood pressure decreased, lipid profile improved, and quality of life increased.
7. All parameters of glycaemic control improved in patients who started or switched to biphasic insulin aspart, basal + insulin aspart, insulin detemir, or insulin aspart.
8. No severe adverse events, such as major hypoglycaemic events, occurred in any study patients.
9. The study suggests that insulin analogues can be considered effective and safe for treating T2DM in Mumbai, India, although further research with larger patient numbers is needed.",0

- Many cell types have been studied for cardiac regeneration, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skeletal myoblasts, bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and resident cardiac stem cells.
* ESCs can differentiate into cardiovascular lineages, but concerns about teratoma formation, graft-versus-host disease, and bioethics have hindered clinical trials.
* iPSCs can be generated from adult somatic cells and differentiate into functional cardiovascular lineages, offering the potential for an unlimited supply of autologous donor cells.
* MSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and cardiomyocytes under special conditions. They can be rapidly expanded in culture and are less immunogenic, making them suitable for allogenic transplantation.
* Skeletal myoblasts can be harvested from muscle biopsies, expanded in culture, and autologously reimplanted. However, they do not differentiate into true cardiomyocytes in vivo, leading to dyssynchronous contractions and a lack of significant benefit in large-scale clinical trials.
* Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in culture. Intracoronary infusion of these cells has been shown to improve left ventricular ejection fraction, decrease infarct scar size, and lower left ventricular end-systolic volume in patients with acute myocardial infarction or chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.
* The optimal timing and dosage of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling modulation may be critical for reliable ex vivo cardiomyocyte differentiation from ESCs or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
* Recent evidence suggests that adult cardiomyocytes may be induced to proliferate, providing a complementary strategy for cardiac regeneration.",0
746,"1. Polyhalite is a mineral commonly found in sedimentary evaporite successions and in rare cases in volcanic successions. It was first described in Austria and has since been found in many salt deposits worldwide.
2. Polyhalite is associated with other minerals such as halite, anhydrite, glauberite, carnallite, kieserite, langbeinite, vanthoffite, chlorides, and sulphides.
3. The crystal structure of polyhalite was first determined in samples from Altaussee, Austria, and later confirmed. It can be synthesized in laboratory conditions by reacting gypsum with appropriate solutions in the ternary system K2SO4-MgSO4-H2O at temperatures above 70°C.
4. Polyhalite forms early diagenetically by brine-back reactions of K-Mg-SO4 brine with earlier formed gypsum, anhydrite, or glauberite after prolonged contact with the precursor rock.
5. Polyhalite is stable between room temperature (0-25°C) and 255-343°C, making it useful for absolute age dating in deciphering the geological history of a region.
6. In the Haselgebirge evaporites of the Northern Calcareous Alps, polyhalite is a minor but widespread and important constituent, occurring mainly intergrown with anhydrite or as vein fillings.
7. The Haselgebirge evaporites experienced maximum temperatures of 200-300°C, and polyhalite is mainly part of the red salt rock (rotsalzgebirge), which is composed of a mixture of reddish-grey salt, anhydrite, polyhalite, glauberite, Na-Mg sulphates, red and black claystones, and grey-brown sandstones.

747," * Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defense, is a critical factor in the development of several systemic diseases.
 * Propofol, a widely used anesthetic, has antioxidant effects and has been shown to ameliorate oxidative injury in various organs.
 * The effects of high-dose propofol on the lipid profile, cardiovascular marker enzymes, and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant indices in rodents have not been determined.
 * In this study, rats were treated with propofol at a human therapeutic dose (2 mg/kg) and twice the therapeutic dose (4 mg/kg) for four weeks.
 * The results showed that propofol increased the levels of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, while decreasing HDL cholesterol levels.
 * The increased cholesterol level may be linked to an increase in alpha-hydroxyl methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, which is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
 * Propofol also increased the activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, indicating an increased detoxifying and antioxidant capability of the liver.
 * However, propofol treatment significantly increased the activities of serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase, which are markers of muscle and heart lesion.
 * The study suggests that the use of propofol in patients with cardiovascular or lipid disorders should be carefully reviewed.",0

749," * Nonsurgical endodontic retreatment is the primary choice to eliminate or reduce microbial content in endodontically failed teeth.
 * Well-compacted root fillings can make retreatment difficult by resisting instruments and leaving residues, which can lead to postoperative inflammation and impaired healing due to extruded irritants.
 * The study compares the apical debris extrusion of three supplementary files (PTN, Wo, and Saf) used after the Protaper Universal RFS for removing residual root canal fillings.
 * The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant differences in the amount of debris extruded by the three files.
 * The teeth were cleaned, shaped, and filled using specific instruments and materials, and then kept for 30 days to allow complete setting of the sealer.
 * Following this, the teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups for retreatment, and the apical debris extruded was collected and weighed.

3. The study also found that the majority of study participants considered malaria to be a serious health problem and had a positive attitude towards the use of bed nets and vector control programs. However, knowledge does not always translate to better preventive measures, and low literacy levels and poor socioeconomic status may be barriers to effective malaria prevention.",0
752,"1. The dynamic folding of the chromatin, including the formation of chromosome territories, genomic compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs), is crucial for regulating gene expression and DNA replication during development. TADs, which range from 100 kb to 1 mb in size, exhibit higher frequency of physical contacts between genes and their regulatory regions and are stable across different species, cell types, and conditions. The boundaries of TADs are associated with specific histone marks, the timing of replication domains, and the enrichment of certain proteins, such as CTCF, cohesin, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites. These boundaries serve as barriers to long- and short-range interactions between DNA sequences, and their strength is influenced by the binding of insulators and the effects of enzymes that modify or remodel chromatin.
2. The major ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, Brg1 (also known as Smarca4), is required for proper nucleosome occupancy and positioning at target regions and for establishing numerous long-range chromatin interactions. A recent study found that Brg1 contributes to TAD boundary strength and that its loss affects nucleosome occupancy and higher-order chromatin organization. Specifically, Brg1 knockdown in human mammary epithelial MCF-10a cells resulted in the differential expression of genes related to extracellular matrix and lipid synthesis, as well as many long non-coding RNAs, which are involved in genome organization. Additionally, Brg1 binds primarily to genic regions and intergenic super-enhancers, which are clusters of regulatory regions with unusual enrichment of factor binding sites and/or histone modifications.
3. Comparison of control and Brg1 knockdown Hi-C data sets revealed that the majority of TAD boundaries were largely overlapping between the two groups, but more than 10% of the boundaries were unique to either the control or the Brg1 knockdown cells. The strength of the TAD boundaries was significantly reduced in Brg1 knockdown cells, resulting in a higher frequency of inter-TAD genomic interactions. This effect was more pronounced for TAD boundaries that were bound by Brg1, as their strength was stronger than the",0

The study uses statistical modeling, specifically Poisson and negative binomial regressions with zero inflated, to analyze the number of failed courses and semesters among students at Iran University of Medical Sciences. The study found that the university average and quota system have an inverse relationship with the number of failed semesters, meaning that an increase in university average and changing from other quota system to free quota system can decrease the number of failed semesters. Additionally, an increase in the number of failed courses can increase the chance of having failed semesters.
2. In the Poisson regression model, the variables of gender and marital status have an inverse and positive relationship with the number of failed courses, respectively. This means that the number of failed courses is higher in males than females and in singles than married students. However, in negative binomial regression, the variables of bachelor level and the faculties of management and rehabilitation caused an increase in the number of failed courses.
3. The study found that the university average has an important role in reducing the number of failed courses, and increasing the number of bachelor and master students can also help reduce the number of failed courses. Additionally, an increase in the number of failed semesters can decrease the logarithm of zero inflated in both models, but the amounts of these changes are different. The study was supported by Iran University of Medical Sciences under the grant number of 370.",0

755,"1. The text discusses the use of Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) as a new three-dimensional imaging method that uses static and dynamic magnetic fields to visualize the distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). MPI can provide very high temporal and spatial resolution with high signal-to-noise ratios. Possible application scenarios for MPI include cardiovascular imaging and guidance of cardiovascular interventions.
2. The text also discusses the importance of suitable tracer material for MPI, specifically long-circulating SPIONs that can provide a sufficient signal within the vessels after a single tracer injection. The circulation time of SPIONs in blood is mainly determined by their overall hydrodynamic diameter, which is influenced by the size of the iron oxide core and the coatings. However, previous reports have shown that SPIONs with a hydrodynamic size greater than 50 nm have rapid and specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system and are cleared rapidly from the blood stream.
3. The text also compares the properties of Resovist, an approved T2* contrast agent for MRI, as a benchmark material for MPI. While Resovist is the best performing commercial SPION for MPI, its hydrodynamic diameter is greater than 50 nm, which limits its in vivo distribution. The text also discusses the importance of understanding the pharmacokinetics of Resovist, especially its half-life in blood, in the context of cardiovascular MPI.",0

 * A survey of 1667 workers at workplaces where arc welding is performed found that 86% had experienced symptoms of uv keratoconjunctivitis, and 45% reported ongoing experience with this ailment. The uvr hazard tends to increase with welding current and is dependent on the type of welding wire. The study also found that the uvr emitted during gmaw performed with a digital inverter-type pulsed arc welding machine was hazardous, with effective irradiance in the range of 3.4 - 11.6 mw / cm. The allowable daily exposure times corresponding to these values are just 0.23 - 5.9 s, which are extremely short times.

761,"1. Reclaiming arid and semi-arid lands involves modifying topography, creating appropriate surface composition, and establishing vegetation, with the latter being the most uncertain category.
2. Vegetation establishment is important for reducing erosion, improving public perception, allowing for productive reuse of land, and reintegrating disturbed lands into the existing landscape.
3. Uncertainty in vegetation establishment comes primarily from reliance on unpredictable rainfall for germination and establishment.
4. Irrigation can benefit exotic weeds more than natives and is generally not more successful due to the need for high intensity/long duration water application.
5. Natural rainfall can allow the establishment of robust native or non-native vegetation, with natives now more recommended due to their long-term stability, resource value for wildlife, and better public acceptance.
6. A mixed plant community is needed to maximize the long-term positive impact of re-vegetation, with perennial grasses often being the primary contributors to surface stability and erosion prevention.

• The olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with neuropotency: globose basal cells (GBCs) and horizontal basal cells (HBCs).
• GBCs are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the olfactory epithelium.
• A study was conducted on rats to characterize GBCs as definitive multipotent stem cells using neural progenitor markers and ionic channels.
• The study found that GBCs are unexcitable, meaning they do not produce electrical signals, and express various neural progenitor cell markers.
• The study also found that voltage-gated sodium channels, which are important for generating electrical signals in neurons, are absent in GBCs.
• The study suggests that GBCs are the ideal candidate for use in clinical research and therapy due to their accessibility, ability to regenerate, and shared environmental niche with the central nervous system.
• Further research is needed to fully understand the biology and effectiveness of GBCs in neurogenesis and their potential medical applications.",1
769,"1. Microglia, which were once thought to play no role in the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), are now known to be crucial for innate immunity within the CNS. They are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and invade the developing brain during embryogenesis.
2. The CNS immune system is more active than previously believed, with the presence of a glymphatic system that enables communication between the brain parenchyma and cervical lymph nodes. This system, along with brain microglia, facilitates immune surveillance of brain interstitial fluid.
3. CSD (cortical spreading depression), a slowly propagating wave of neural and glial depolarization, has been shown to induce inflammatory activation of microglia. This activation can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which can lower the threshold for CSD induction and form a positive feedback mechanism that favors its perpetuation.",0
770,"1. Transposable elements (TEs) were once considered junk DNA, but they have been shown to serve as a genomic reservoir for new regulatory and coding sequences, allowing genetic innovation and organismal evolution. They can be molecularly domesticated to form new cellular protein-coding genes. TE-encoded proteins have properties that can be of interest for host cellular pathways, such as binding, copying, cutting, processing, and recombining nucleic acids, as well as modifying and interacting with host proteins.
2. There are many cases of TE-derived genes fulfilling important functions in plants, fungi, and animals, including vertebrates. For example, several multigenic families have been formed from different events of molecular domestication of the gag gene of Ty3/gypsy elements, a super family of LTR retrotransposons active in fish and amphibians but extinct in mammals. These genes encode a structural protein with three functional regions: the matrix (ma) domain playing a role in targeting cellular membranes, the capsid (ca) domain involved in interactions with other proteins during particle assembly, and the nucleocapsid (nc), which binds to viral RNA genomes through zinc fingers.
3. Molecular domestication of TEs has played an important role in the evolution of specific sublineages within vertebrates. For example, gin genes, a pair of ancient vertebrate domesticated genes for which no function has been identified so far, have been detected in mammals, birds, and reptiles (gin1) and tetrapods, bony fish, and sharks (gin2). The presence of both genes over such long periods of evolution suggests important, so far unknown conserved functions in vertebrates. Gin2 was lost in a common ancestor of monotremes and placental mammals, indicating that either gin2 function was not essential anymore or that this function is fulfilled now by gin1 in these sublineages.",0

* These diseases can spread from cell to cell and amplify over time, leading to a self-sustaining cycle that results in disease.
* Molecular chaperones play a crucial role in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, but can become imbalanced during cellular stress, leading to the formation of protein deposits.
* Protein aggregates can cause both loss of function and gain of pathologic function, leading to a variety of symptoms and diseases.
* Fibrillar protein aggregates are a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, and their formation and spread can be replicated in vitro.

 * Beta adrenergic receptors (βAR) are members of a family of receptors that play a role in atherogenesis and are targets for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.
 * Two major non-synonymous SNPs of βAR have been identified at nucleotides 46 (A>G) and 79 (C>G), causing changes in amino acid residues at positions 16 (Arg>Gly) and 27 (Gln>Glu) of the amino terminus and the fourth intracellular loop.
 * An enhanced agonist-mediated receptor down-regulation for the gly16 variant of βAR and a resistance to down-regulation for the glu27 variant of βAR have been observed.
 * A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the association of βAR with ischemic stroke and offer early diagnosis of susceptible subjects.
 * Three studies involving 1,642 cases and 1,673 controls were included in the meta-analysis for allelic association and 518 cases and 510 controls for genotypic association.
 * The meta-analysis results did not show a significant association between arg16gly polymorphism of βAR and ischemic stroke.
 * However, a significant association was observed between gln27glu polymorphism of βAR and ischemic stroke when assuming either recessive or dominant models of inheritance.

2. A meta-analysis of 10 published reports found that RRSO is strongly associated with substantial reductions in the risks of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers among women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
3. The meta-analysis provides summary risk reduction estimates to guide women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies.
4. Data on the effects of birth cohort, timing of surgery, or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with RRSO were not available.
5. The search for relevant studies yielded 346 studies, of which 309 included the term ""BRCA1"" and 267 included the term ""BRCA2"".
6. Of the studies identified, some publications were not included because they did not estimate risk reduction, such as case reports, psychosocial or behavioral studies, commentaries, and clinical recommendations.
7. The meta-analysis found an 80% reduction in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk and a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk associated with RRSO in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
8. The analysis also found that modeling studies have demonstrated that salpingo-oophorectomy has a large effect on years of life added, particularly when adjusted for quality of life.

781,"1. Bladder cancer is the second most common cancer in the urogenital tract, and is often linked to smoking. In a study of 96 patients with bladder cancer, 36% had cotinine levels indicating active smoking, and 4% had cotinine levels equivalent to passive smoking. However, only 19% of patients admitted to smoking in the questionnaire. This shows that not all patients are truthful about their smoking habits.
2. All types of cigarette smoking, regardless of nicotine content or filter, have the same negative effect on the body. There is limited research on how smoking affects the course of bladder cancer, the number of recurrences, and the progression of the disease due to the unreliability of smoking questionnaires and the high cost of monitoring cotinine in urine.
3. The study found that determining cotinine levels in urine is a convenient and easy way to verify smoking habits and to assess the risks of passive smoking. Monitoring cotinine levels allows for an objective assessment and can help convey recommendations for quitting tobacco smoking. The study also highlights the importance of limiting smoking in public places and the harmful effects of smoking in enclosed areas, particularly on children.",0

This coexistence can negatively impact quality of life. The pathophysiological mechanism behind this correlation is not fully understood, but several hypotheses have been proposed, including overactivation of the autonomic nervous system and increased tension of the sympathetic nervous system.
2. A study was conducted to examine the effects on erectile function of a combination of the alpha-blocker tamsulosin to improve LUTS and the antimuscarinic agent solifenacin to improve irritative symptoms of the bladder. Male patients aged 40 years or older who had concurrent LUTS/BPH and ED were enrolled in the study. The results showed that concomitant administration of alpha-blockers and anticholinergics improved LUTS more effectively in patients with LUTS/BPH, and this improvement was also associated with a positive effect on sexual function.
3. The use of anticholinergic agents (or antimuscarinic agents) in patients with LUTS/BPH has been attempted to improve storage symptoms due to overactive bladder (OAB). While these agents have been shown to be effective and safe in improving LUTS, there is concern that they may lead to aggravation of voiding difficulty or the development of urinary retention. However, a study of 39 men with BPH and LUTS found no significant impairment in sexual function after administration of anticholinergic agents. In patients with LUTS/BPH and ED, concomitant use of tamsulosin and solifenacin was effective for improving LUTS, but sexual function was not significantly improved by the concomitant administration of alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics.",0

EMT involves reprogramming of the cells by transcription factors such as Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist, Snail, and Slug. A hallmark of EMT is loss of E-cadherin expression, loss of polarity, acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and increased motility. The miR-200 family, which includes miR-200c, has been implicated in the process of EMT. These miRNAs repress Zeb1 and Zeb2, which in turn repress E-cadherin. The mutual repression between miR-200c and Zeb1 creates a double negative feedback loop that allows for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states. This paper focuses on the role of miR-200c in breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers.",1
799,"• The transobturator approach for treating female stress urinary incontinence using a midurethral sling (MUS) was first described by Delorme as an alternative to the retropubic approach to reduce complications. Two variations of the transobturator approach are the outside-in and inside-out methods.
• A meta-analysis found similar cure rates for the three most commonly used surgical approaches for treating stress urinary incontinence: retropubic, outside-in transobturator, and inside-out transobturator MUS procedures. Anatomical studies have confirmed the safety of the obturator approaches in relation to neurovascular structures, but traditional anatomical dissections do not allow for the study of the MUS's configuration in relation to the urethra.
• A cadaveric study was conducted to compare the specific relationship between the tape and the urethra in both the inside-out and outside-in approaches using CT scan image analysis after tantalum wire marked mesh slings were implanted in a series of cadavers. The results showed that the out-in MUS had a mean full inner angle of 144 (95%CI: 131-151) compared to 122 (95%CI: 107-136) for the in-out MUS (p = 0.02).
• The use of tantalum wires threaded through the polypropylene-/prolene-tape in combination with three-dimensional CT-scanning yielded a unique method to visualize midurethral tapes throughout the entirety of their trajectory. This technique can be applied to different types of non-radio-opaque implants, allowing for a better spatial understanding of the anatomical position within the pelvis.",1
