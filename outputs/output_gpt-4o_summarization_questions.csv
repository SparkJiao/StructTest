[Who is involved?]: The study involves researchers investigating the role of mir-200c, cancer cell lines such as HEC50, MDA-MB-231, and HEY, and the proteins ZEB1, ZEB2, and TUBB3.

[When is the action happening?]: The research and experiments are ongoing, with the study focusing on the current understanding of mir-200c's role in cancer biology.

[Where is the action happening?]: The action is happening in laboratory settings where cancer cell lines are cultured and analyzed to study the effects of mir-200c on cancer progression and treatment response.
