    * Critical to achieving capabilities are advanced technologies like composite materials, avionics, and propulsion systems.
    * Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals to lower operating costs and achieve wartime operational availability.
* In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program due to budget constraints.
    * Funding reduced from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001.
    * Development phase extended by 3 years, production decision deferred, and two flyable prototypes to be produced.
* Army proposed a program restructure to acquire six additional aircraft by deferring developmental efforts to fiscal year 2002 and beyond.
    * DOD approved the proposal in March 1995.
    * Operational testing will not begin until after low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing risks associated with concurrency.
* Comanche program experienced significant cost increases, with estimated total program acquisition cost for 1,292 aircraft exceeding $44 billion.
    * Program acquisition unit cost increased by 185% from 1985 estimate.
    * Secretary’s decision and Army’s restructure increased risk of higher total program cost and cost per aircraft.
* Software development, maintainability, and weight growth issues pose risks to the Comanche program.
    * High turnover of software engineers, delays in software development and testing, and configuration management problems.
    * Maintainability requirements such as direct MMH/FH, MTTR, and fault isolation may not be achievable, affecting operating costs and wartime availability goals.

	• Labor issued guidance for states to establish profiling tools and provide reemployment services, but many states have not updated their models, risking loss of predictive accuracy over time.

• States use statistical models or characteristic screens to identify claimants likely to exhaust benefits.
	• Forty-five states use statistical models, while 7 use characteristic screens, and 1 state allows local areas to decide.
	• States vary in the definition of exhaustion and the variables used in their models, with some not updating their models regularly.

• Research studies have shown positive impacts of worker profiling on reducing UI duration and increasing subsequent employment earnings.
	• However, data limitations and lack of ongoing evaluation make it difficult to assess the current effectiveness of the worker-profiling initiative.
	• Labor should reevaluate data collection, ensure accuracy of state profiling models, encourage adherence to in-depth reemployment services, and evaluate the impact of the program on UI claimants' reemployment.

• Low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes in 2009 led to renewed congressional interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs).
    • MPCs are derived from raw milk and used in various food products, animal feed, and industrial products.
    • U.S. imports of MPCs have limited trade restrictions, while advocates of stricter controls argue it would benefit domestic producers and raise milk prices.
    • Opponents fear increased costs and higher retail food prices if import restrictions are imposed.

• The U.S. dairy program supports prices of dairy products and pays farmers subsidies when milk prices decline below certain levels.
    • Unlimited market access could result in large government purchases under the price support program or higher payments under the Milk Income Loss Contract program.
    • Dairy imports are modest relative to domestic production, with U.S. imports of MPCs and casein/caseinates hovering around 150,000 metric tons annually.
    • Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market include New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union.

• Legislation has been proposed to limit imports of MPCs, with the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act aiming to introduce TRQs for MPCs and casein/caseinates.
    • The proposed TRQs would impose higher duties on imports exceeding specified annual quantities.
    • Enactment of the legislation could lead to compensation negotiations with major MPC suppliers under WTO rules.
    • U.S. milk producers generally support import restrictions, while dairy product processors oppose them due to concerns about increased production costs and consumer prices.

• The potential impact of imposing TRQs on MPCs depends on farm milk prices relative to USDA's purchase price levels and could affect government purchases of dairy products.
    • USDA purchased surplus dairy products from 2008 to 2009, primarily nonfat dry milk, with the impact of TRQs on farm prices depending on product prices and government purchases.
    • The proposed TRQ levels could result in a relatively small effect on average U.S. farm milk prices, equating to about 0.7% of average U.S. milk production during 2006-2008.
    • Some view the proposed import restrictions as part of a larger set of policies to address the financial situation for U.S. dairy farmers.
