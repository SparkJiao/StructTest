- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.  
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.  
- Therefore, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.  


**Step 2** Determine the time spent in standstill traffic.  

- John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  
- During this time, he does not cover any distance.  


**Step 3** Calculate the distance covered while driving at 30 mph.  

- After 2 hours of standstill traffic, John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.  
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.  
- This means he has moved 15 miles closer to home.  


**Step 4** Calculate the remaining time available for driving.  

- John has a total of 4 hours to get home.  
- He has already spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph.  
- Remaining time = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.  


**Step 5** Calculate the distance covered while driving at 80 mph.  

- John drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph.  
- Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.  
- This means he has moved 120 miles closer to home.  


**Step 6** Calculate John's total distance traveled towards home.  

- Total distance towards home = Distance from 30 mph driving + Distance from 80 mph driving.  
- Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.  


**Step 7** Determine John's final distance from home.  

- John was initially 180 miles away from home.  
- After driving towards home, he has covered 135 miles.  
- Final distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**1. Identify the ratio of their ages**  
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is given as 7:11.  
- This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen has 11 parts.  

  

**2. Set up the equation for their ages**  
- Let Darrell's age be represented as \( 7x \) and Allen's age as \( 11x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.  

  

**3. Write the equation for their total age**  
- According to the problem, their total age is 162.  
- Therefore, we can write the equation:  
  \[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]  

  

**4. Simplify the equation**  
- Combine like terms:  
  \[ 18x = 162 \]  

  

**5. Solve for \( x \)**  
- Divide both sides by 18:  
  \[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]  

  

**6. Calculate their current ages**  
- Now substitute \( x \) back into the expressions for their ages:  
  - Darrell's age: \( 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \)  
  - Allen's age: \( 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

To find out how fast John runs, we first need to determine the total time he spends running each week.

  

### 2

John runs 3 hours on the first day. For the other two days, he runs half as much time, which is 1.5 hours each day (since half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours).

  

### 3

Now, we can calculate the total running time for the week:

- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

  

### 4

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. To find his running speed, we will use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

  

### 5

Substituting the values we have:

- Distance = 60 miles
- Time = 6 hours

So, 

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

First, calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah plans to remove.

- Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
- Therefore, the weight of 30 comic books is calculated as follows:
  
  \[
  \text{Weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
  \]


### 2

Next, determine how much weight Uriah still needs to remove after taking out the comic books.

- He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds.
- After removing 7.5 pounds from the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:
  
  \[
  \text{Remaining weight} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
  \]


### 3

Now, calculate how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve the remaining weight.

- Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
- To find out how many toys correspond to 7.5 pounds, use the formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Number of toys} = \frac{\text{Remaining weight}}{\text{Weight of each toy}} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15

### 2
Out of these 25 oranges, there is 1 bad orange.

Next, we calculate the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we find 20% of 25:

Determine the final volume of sauce Freda made. 

- Freda made 32 ounces of sauce.

### 2

Calculate the initial volume of canned tomatoes used.

- Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the initial volume of canned tomatoes must be double the final volume of sauce.
- Therefore, the initial volume of canned tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

### 3

Determine how many cans of tomatoes were used.

- Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.
- To find the number of cans used, divide the initial volume of canned tomatoes by the volume per can.
- Number of cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

### 4

Calculate the total number of tomatoes used.

- Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to understand the relationship between the distance covered and the time taken.

### 2

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. This means we can calculate the time taken to cover each mile by dividing the time by the distance:

- Time per mile = 10 minutes / 3 miles = 3.33 minutes per mile (approximately).

### 3

Next, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank needs to cover in total. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

### 4

Now, we can calculate the total time required to cover the entire 42 miles by multiplying the total distance by the time taken per mile:

- Total time = 42 miles * 3.33 minutes per mile = 140 minutes (approximately).

### 5

Since the fog bank is moving continuously, we can also think of it as covering the entire distance simultaneously. Therefore, we can calculate how many segments of 3 miles fit into 42 miles:

- Number of segments = 42 miles / 3 miles = 14 segments.

### 6

Now, since it takes 10 minutes to cover each segment of 3 miles, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time per segment:

- Total time = 14 segments * 10 minutes = 140 minutes.

### 7

Thus, we have confirmed that the time taken for the fog bank to cover the entire city is consistent through both methods of calculation.

### 8

Finally, we can conclude that the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

### 2

For Beatrice, the dimensions of her roll-ups are:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups

To find the total number of roll-ups, we multiply the width by the length:
- Total for Beatrice = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

### 3

For Marcell, the dimensions of his roll-ups are:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week. To find out how many pads he uses in a month, we first need to determine how many weeks are in a month. 

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

  

# 2. Calculate the total pads used in a month

To find the total number of pads used in a month, we multiply the number of pads used per week by the number of weeks in a month:

\[ 
\text{Total pads in a month} = 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 8 \text{ pads/month} 
\]

  

# 3. Determine the number of sheets per pad

Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. This is a fixed quantity that we will use in our calculations.

  

# 4. Calculate the total sheets used in a month

To find the total number of sheets Miguel uses in a month, we multiply the total number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:

\[ 
\text{Total sheets in a month} = 8 \text{ pads/month} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}

- First, calculate the distance Rosie runs at her initial speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

### 2

- Use the formula for distance: 
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
  \]
- For the first part:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

### 3

- Next, determine how much time Rosie has left to run after the first 3 hours. 

### 4

- Since she runs for a total of 7 hours, the remaining time is:
  \[
  7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

### 5

- Now, calculate the distance she runs at her second speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. 

### 6

- Again, use the distance formula:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, which means these spoons are not included in the total she had when setting the table.

  

# 3. Calculate the number of spoons Julia had before using any.
To find out how many spoons Julia had before using the 3 spoons, we add the 3 spoons back to the total she had when setting the table:  
12 spoons + 3 spoons = 15 spoons.

  

# 4. Subtract the spoons given by her husband to find out how many were in Julia's package.
Since her husband bought 5 spoons, we subtract these from the total:

- The problem states that each pepper costs $15.  

  
**Step 2** Calculate the cost of one watermelon.  

- Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we calculate:  
  \[ \text{Cost of watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]  
- Therefore, one watermelon costs $45.  

  
**Step 3** Calculate the cost of one orange.  

- The problem states that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon.  
- Thus, we calculate:

- Therefore, one orange costs $40.  

  
**Step 4** Calculate the total cost for 4 watermelons.

### 1. Define the variables

- Let the number of queen bees be \( q \).
- The number of baby bees will then be \( 2q \) (since there are twice as many babies as queens).
- The number of worker bees will be \( 4q \) (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

  

### 2. Set up the equation

- The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700.
- Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
  \[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]

  

### 3. Simplify the equation

- Combine the terms on the left side:  
  \[ 7q = 700 \]

  

### 4. Solve for \( q \)

- Divide both sides by 7 to find \( q \):  
  \[ q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

  

### 5. Calculate the number of baby bees

- Since the number of baby bees is \( 2q \):  
  \[ 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

  

### 6. Calculate the number of worker bees

- The number of worker bees is \( 4q \):  
  \[ 4q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

  

### 7. Verify the total

- Check the total number of bees:  
  \[ q + 2q + 4q = 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 \]  
- This confirms our calculations are correct.

4. Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs.
5. Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32.
6. Total cost of cloths = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40.
7. Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

- Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours.

### 2

- In the next 6 hours, she sees half of that number return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees returning.

### 3

- In the following 6 hours, she sees two times the number of bees that initially left the hive fly out again. This means \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave the hive.

### 4

- By this point, the total number of bees that have left the hive is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees.

### 5

- The 15 bees that returned earlier are now accounted for, so the number of bees that have not yet returned is \( 90 - 15 = 75 \) bees.

### 6

- In the final 6 hours, all the bees that left before and had not returned come back to the hive. This means the 75 bees that had not returned will now return.

### 7

- Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75.

Dave initially ate 14 french fries.

### 2
The seagull then ate half of what Dave ate. Half of 14 is 7. So, the seagull ate 7 fries.

### 3
After the seagull, three pigeons bullied the seagull away and each ate 3 fries. Therefore, the total amount eaten by the pigeons is:
3 pigeons × 3 fries = 9 fries.

### 4
Now, we can calculate the total number of fries eaten so far:
- Fries eaten by Dave: 14
- Fries eaten by the seagull: 7
- Fries eaten by the pigeons: 9

Total eaten = 14 + 7 + 9 = 30 fries.

### 5
Let \( x \) be the initial number of fries in the pack. After all the eating, the remaining fries can be expressed as:
Remaining fries = \( x - 30 \).

### 6
Next, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. The remaining fries after the pigeons is \( x - 30 \). The raccoon took:
\(\frac{2}{3}(x - 30)\).

### 7
The amount left after the raccoon took his share is:
Remaining after raccoon = \( (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).

### 8
After the raccoon, ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\(\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5\).

### 9
Solving the equation:
\(\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6\) (adding 1 to both sides),
\(x - 30 = 18\) (multiplying both sides by 3),
\(x = 48\) (adding 30 to both sides).

### 10
Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is 48.

- Sally Thirtytwo is given to be 8 years old. 

### 2

Determine the age of Sally Four.

- Since Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, we need to find Sally Four's age first. 

### 3

Calculate the age of Granny Red.

- If we let Sally Four's age be \( x \), then Granny Red's age is \( 2x \). 

### 4

Relate Sally Two's age to Granny Red's age.

- Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so her age can be expressed as \( 2x + 3 \).

### 5

Establish the relationship between Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo.

- Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, we have \( x = 8 \).

### 6

Calculate the ages of the birds.

- Substitute \( x = 8 \) into the equations:
  - Sally Four = 8 years
  - Granny Red = \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) years
  - Sally Two = \( 16 + 3 = 19 \) years

First, we need to determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. 

- They sell each glass for $0.50.
- They get 20 glasses per gallon.
- Therefore, the revenue per gallon is calculated as:  
  \[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \text{ glasses} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/glass} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

  

### 2

Next, we calculate the total costs for making lemonade.

- The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon.
- The cost for sugar is $2 per gallon.
- Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:  
  \[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

  

### 3

Now, we can set up the profit equation.

- Profit is defined as revenue minus costs.
- They made a profit of $25.
- Let \( x \) be the number of gallons made. The profit equation can be expressed as:  
  \[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]  
  \[ 25 = (10 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times x) - (5 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times x) \]  

  

### 4

Simplifying the profit equation.

- The equation simplifies to:  
  \[ 25 = (10x - 5x) \]  
  \[ 25 = 5x \]  

  

### 5

Solving for \( x \).

- Divide both sides by 5:  
  \[ x = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]  
- This means they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Calculating the total cost for lemons.

- The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon.
- Since they made 5 gallons, the total cost for lemons is:  
  \[ \text{Total cost for lemons} = 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

- The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.  
- This amount is already given as the total cost for the tickets.  

  

**Step 2** Determine the cost of food.  

- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.  
- Therefore, the cost of food is:  
  \[ \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]  

  

**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the rides.  

- They went on 2 rides, each costing $33.  
- The total cost for the rides is:  
  \[ \text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]  

  

**Step 4** Find the total expenses.  

- Now, we add the costs of tickets, food, and rides to find the total expenses:  
  \[ \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides} \]  
  \[ \text{Total expenses} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]  

  

**Step 5** Calculate the amount each friend pays.  

- Since the total expenses are to be split evenly among the three friends, we divide the total expenses by 3:  
  \[ \text{Amount per friend} = \frac{\text{Total expenses}}{3} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

Tom starts with **50 trees**.

  

### 2

Each year, he **plants 10 trees** and **chops down 2 trees**. This results in a net increase of:

- **10 trees planted** - **2 trees chopped down** = **8 trees added per year**.

  

### 3

Over **10 years**, the total number of trees added is:

- **8 trees/year** × **10 years** = **80 trees**.

  

### 4

After 10 years, the total number of trees before accounting for any deaths is:

### 5

After 10 years, **30% of the trees die**. To find out how many trees die:

- **30% of 130 trees** = **0.30 × 130** = **39 trees**.

  

### 6

Now, we subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:

- To find the total score needed for an average of 93, we first note that after dropping the lowest score, Brinley will have 5 scores contributing to the average.
- The formula for average is:  
  \[
  \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}}
  \]
- Since she wants an average of 93 with 5 tests, we set up the equation:  
  \[
  93 = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{5}
  \]
- Multiplying both sides by 5 gives:  
  \[
  \text{Total Score} = 93 \times 5 = 465
  \]


**Step 2** Calculate the sum of Brinley's current test scores.

- Brinley's current test scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
- We calculate the sum of these scores:  
  \[
  89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
  \]


**Step 3** Determine the score needed on the sixth test.

- Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.
- The total score including the sixth test will be:  
  \[
  438 + x
  \]
- After dropping the lowest score, we need this total to equal 465. Therefore, we set up the equation:  
  \[
  438 + x = 465
  \]


**Step 4** Solve for \( x \).

- Rearranging the equation gives:  
  \[
  x = 465 - 438
  \]
- Calculating this gives:  
  \[
  x = 27
  \]


**Step 5** Verify the result.

- If Brinley scores 27 on the sixth test, her scores will be 89, 71, 92, 100, 86, and 27.
- The lowest score (27) will be dropped, leaving the scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
- The sum of these scores is:  
  \[
  89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

- The average will then be:  
  \[
  \frac{438}{5} = 93

Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. 

### 2

From the problem, we know that:

- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
- Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs daily.

### 3

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

- The total egg production equation:  
  \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)

- The relationship between the number of chickens:  
  \( w = r + 2 \) (since there are two more white chickens than red chickens)

### 4

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:

- Replace \( w \) in the total egg production equation:  
  \( 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \)

### 5

Simplify the equation:

- Distributing the 5:  
  \( 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \)

- Combine like terms:  
  \( 8r + 10 = 42 \)

212,"**Step 1** Calculate the perimeter of the park.  

- The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles and 6 miles.  
- The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:  
  \[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]  
- Substituting the values:  
  \[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]  

  
**Step 2** Perform the addition inside the parentheses.  

- Calculate \( 1.5 + 6 \):  
  \[ 1.5 + 6 = 7.5 \]  

  
**Step 3** Calculate the perimeter using the result from Step 2.  

- Now substitute back into the perimeter formula:  
  \[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]  
- Calculate \( 2 \times 7.5 \):  
  \[ P = 15 \]  
- Therefore, the perimeter of the park is 15 miles.  

  
**Step 4** Determine the time taken to walk the perimeter.  

- Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour.  
- To find the time \( T \) taken to walk the perimeter, use the formula:  
  \[ T = \frac{distance}{speed} \]  
- Here, the distance is the perimeter (15 miles) and the speed is 3 miles/hour.  

  
**Step 5** Substitute the values into the time formula.  

- Calculate the time:  
  \[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]  

  
**Step 6** Perform the division to find the time.  

- Calculate \( \frac{15}{3} \):  
  \[ T = 5 \]  
- Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

214,"**Step 1** Identify the variables.  

- Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool.  
- Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.  

**Step 2** Establish the relationship from 4 minutes ago.  

- Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons (since it loses 4 gallons per minute).  
- Four minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.  
- At that time, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:  
  \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]  

**Step 3** Simplify the equation from Step 2.  

- Expanding the equation gives:  
  \[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]  
- Rearranging this gives:  
  \[ B = 2S + 16 \]  

**Step 4** Establish the current relationship.  

- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:  
  \[ B = 4S \]  

**Step 5** Set up the system of equations.  

- We now have two equations:  
  1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)  
  2. \( B = 4S \)  

**Step 6** Substitute and solve for \( S \).  

- Setting the two expressions for \( B \) equal gives:  
  \[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]  
- Rearranging this gives:  
  \[ 16 = 4S - 2S \]  
  \[ 16 = 2S \]  
  \[ S = 8 \]  

**Step 7** Find the current amount of water in the big pool.  

- Substitute \( S = 8 \) back into \( B = 4S \):  
  \[ B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]  

**Step 8** Verify the conditions.  

- Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons.  
- Four minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons.  
- Indeed, \( 48 = 2 \times 24 \) (big pool had twice as much).  
- Now, \( B = 32 \) and \( S = 8 \) gives \( 32 = 4 \times 8 \) (big pool has four times as much).

- Watermelons harvested = 36  

- Remaining watermelons = \( 120 - 36 = 84 \)

### 6

Finally, we find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

- Remaining watermelons after the first harvest = 84  
- Watermelons harvested after two weeks = 63

Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has. According to the problem, we know that:

- John has twice as many candies as Robert:  
  \[
  J = 2R
  \]

### 2

We are given that John has 54 candies:  
\[
J = 54
\]

### 3

Substituting the value of \( J \) into the equation from step 1:  
\[
54 = 2R
\]

### 4

To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \):  
\[
R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

### 5

Now we know Robert has 27 candies. According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert:  
\[
A = R + 6
\]

### 6

Substituting the value of \( R \) into the equation for James:  
\[

- Chris has 6 trees in his yard. 

### 2

- Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
- Therefore, Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.

### 3

- Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. 
- First, calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
- Then, add 5 to this amount: \( 6 + 5 = 11 \).
- So, Harry has 11 trees.

### 4

- To find how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has: 
- \( 11 - 3 = 8 \).

### 5

- Therefore, the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard is 8.

Let Ruby's current age be \( R \) and Sam's current age be \( S \). 

  

# 2. Set up the first equation
According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be expressed as:
\[ R = 6S \] 

  

# 3. Set up the second equation
In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). This gives us the equation:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \] 

  

# 4. Substitute the first equation into the second
Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \] 

  

# 5. Simplify the equation
Expanding the right side:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \] 

  

# 6. Rearrange the equation
Rearranging gives:
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \] 

  

# 7. Solve for Sam's age
Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \] 

  

# 8. Verify the solution
If Sam is 6, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \). In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \). Checking the condition:

To find the total weight of the 80 flagstones, we multiply the number of flagstones by the weight of each flagstone.

Total weight = Number of flagstones × Weight of each flagstone  
Total weight = 80 × 75 pounds = 6000 pounds


# 2. Determine the weight capacity of one truck

The delivery truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds.


# 3. Calculate the number of trucks needed

To find out how many trucks are needed to transport the total weight of the flagstones, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck.

Number of trucks = Total weight ÷ Weight capacity of one truck  
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds = 3 trucks


# 4. Round up if necessary

Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, 3 trucks are sufficient as the division resulted in a whole number.


# 5. Conclusion

Thus, the landscaping company will need a total of 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at a speed of 60 miles/hour.

### 2
The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:
\[ 
\text{Slow lane speed} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} 
\]

### 3
The car in the fast lane traveled a total distance of 480 miles. To find the time it took for the fast lane car to cover this distance, we use the formula:
\[ 
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} 
\]

### 4
Calculating the time for the fast lane car:
\[ 
\text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} 
\]

### 5
Since both cars are covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can now calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance using its speed of 30 miles/hour.

### 6
Using the same formula for the slow lane car:
\[ 
\text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} 
\]

### 7
Calculating the time for the slow lane car:
\[ 
\text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours} 
\]

### 8
Thus, the slow lane car took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

### 9
In summary, the fast lane car took 8 hours, while the slow lane car took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

### 10
Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the distance of 480 miles is:

To determine how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, we first need to understand how pages are arranged when printed on a folded sheet of paper.

  

### 2

A single piece of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages. This is because each side of the paper has two pages when folded: one on the front and one on the back.

  

### 3

To find out how many pieces of paper are needed for 32 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages created by one piece of paper.

  

### 4

Calculating this gives us: 

\[ 
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 
\]

  

### 5

Thus, 8 pieces of paper are required to create a 32-page tabloid.

  

### 6

Each of these 8 pieces of paper will be folded to create the necessary pages, ensuring that all pages are printed correctly in the right order.

  

### 7

This method of folding and printing is standard for creating booklets, magazines, and tabloids, allowing for efficient use of paper.

  

### 8

In summary, the arrangement of pages and the folding technique allows for a compact and organized way to produce multiple pages from a limited number of sheets.

- Cera is currently 46 years old.  
- Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.  

  

**Step 2** Determine Noah's age six years ago based on the relationship with Cera's age.  

- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.  
- Therefore, Noah's age six years ago = 40 / 2 = 20 years old.  

  

**Step 3** Calculate Noah's current age.  

- Noah's current age = Noah's age six years ago + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 years old.  

  

**Step 4** Use the information about the population of Chile six years ago.  

- The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.  
- Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 20 = 60,000.  

  

**Step 5** Relate the population of Chile six years ago to the current population.  

- The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.  
- Let P be the current population of Chile.  
- Therefore, 60,000 = P / 2.  

  

**Step 6** Solve for the current population of Chile.

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each. Therefore, the total number of people from these families is:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

  

# 2. Calculate the total number of invited guests from families with 4 people
Martha also invited 3 families with 4 people each. Thus, the total number of people from these families is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

  

# 3. Calculate the total number of invited guests
Now, we can find the total number of invited guests by adding the two previous results:

\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

  

# 4. Determine the number of guests who couldn't attend due to illness
It is given that 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

- Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.  
- The store initially had 50 marbles.  
- Total marbles after the purchase = 50 (initial) + 20 (bought) = 70 marbles.  


**Step 2** Determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.  

- Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.  
- He bought 20 marbles, so the number of marbles from his father = (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.  


**Step 3** Calculate the new total number of marbles in the store.  

- After receiving marbles from his father, the total number of marbles = 70 (current) + 8 (from father) = 78 marbles.  


**Step 4** Calculate the total weight of the marbles.  

- Each marble weighs 2 kg.

- The volume of a rectangular prism (pool) is calculated using the formula:  
  \[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \]
  
- For this pool:  
  - Length = 6 feet  
  - Width = 4 feet  
  - Depth = 5 feet  

- Therefore, the volume is:  
  \[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

  

### 2. Perform the multiplication

- Calculate the volume step-by-step:  
  - First, calculate the area of the base:  
    \[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]  
  - Then, multiply by the depth:  
    \[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]  

- Thus, the total volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.  

  

### 3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool

- The cost to fill the pool is determined by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:  
  \[ \text{Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]  

- Given that the cost per cubic foot is $0.1:  
  \[ \text{Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]  

  

### 4. Perform the final multiplication

- Calculate the total cost:  
  \[ 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we first need to understand the trading system at Ralph's record store.

### 2

The store allows customers to trade 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every new record received, 2 old records must be given.

### 3

Given that the 5 people left with a total of 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they must have traded in.

### 4

Since each new record requires 2 old records, we can find the total number of old records traded by multiplying the number of new records by 2:

\[
\text{Total old records} = \text{Number of new records} \times 2
\]

### 5

Substituting the number of new records into the equation:

\[
\text{Total old records} = 7 \times 2 = 14
\]

### 6

Thus, the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

### 7

This calculation confirms that the trading system is consistent, as the number of old records brought in matches the number required for the new records received.

### 8

Therefore, we conclude that the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 14.

338,"# 1. Define the variables

Let the number of students in the two equal groups be \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

  

# 2. Set up the equation

The total number of students in all three groups is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

  

# 3. Simplify the equation

Combining like terms in the equation gives:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

  

# 4. Solve for \( x \)

To isolate \( x \), add 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[
3x = 210
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 70
\]

  

# 5. Find the number of students in the smallest group

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

  

# 6. Verify the total number of students

To ensure our solution is correct, we can check the total number of students:

- Two groups of 70: \( 70 + 70 = 140 \)
- One group of 60: \( 60 \)

Adding these together gives:

\[
140 + 60 = 200

This confirms our calculations are correct.

First, we need to determine the total time John spent on his vacation. We know that he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.

- Boating time: 6 hours
- Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

### 2

Next, we calculate the total time spent watching shows. John watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours.

- Total time watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

### 3

Now, we can find the total time spent on activities so far:

- Total time spent on activities = Boating time + Swimming time + Watching shows
- Total time spent on activities = 6 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours

### 4

According to the problem, the 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. We can set up an equation to find the total time (T):

- 0.30 * T = 15 hours
- T = 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours

### 5

Now that we have the total time John spent on vacation, we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing. We know that he spent 40% of his total time sightseeing.

- Billy starts with $10.  
- Let \( x \) be the amount spent on candy.  
- The change after buying candy is \( 10 - x \).  

  

**Step 2** Determine the cost of gumballs.  

- Each gumball costs $0.05.  
- If Billy buys 40 gumballs, the total cost for gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.  

  

**Step 3** Calculate the amount of change Billy spends on gumballs.  

- Billy spends half of his change on gumballs.  
- Therefore, the amount spent on gumballs is \( \frac{10 - x}{2} = 2 \).  

  

**Step 4** Set up the equation to find the amount spent on candy.  

- From the previous step, we have:  
  \[ \frac{10 - x}{2} = 2 \]  
- Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:  
  \[ 10 - x = 4 \]  

  

**Step 5** Solve for \( x \).  

- Rearranging the equation gives:

- The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.  
- The number of pounds of candy bought is:

- John drives to his friend's house, which is originally 200 miles away.
- He takes a detour that adds 10 miles to his trip.
- Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house is:  
  \( 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \)

  

# 2. Calculate the time taken to reach the friend's house

- John drives to his friend's house at a speed of 70 mph.
- To find the time taken, use the formula:  
  \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \)
- Thus, the time taken to reach his friend's house is:  
  \( \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

  

# 3. Calculate the time taken to return home

To determine the minimum score Jane needs on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has scored so far.

  

### 2

Jane's scores on the first two tests are as follows:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

  

### 3

Now, we add these two scores together to find out how many points she has accumulated so far:
- Total points from first two tests = 15 + 18 = 33 points

  

### 4

Next, we know that Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests to be promoted. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many points she needs on the third test (let's call it x):
- 33 + x ≥ 42

  

### 5

To find x, we can rearrange the equation:
- x ≥ 42 - 33
- x ≥ 9

  

### 6

This means that Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to meet the requirement of 42 points in total.

  

### 7

To summarize, Jane's scores are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points
- Minimum required on third test: 9 points

  

### 8

Thus, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

### 2
Next, we calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. The problem states that the number of shoplifters is equal to four times the number of mask-refusing customers minus 5. Therefore, we can express this as:
\[ 
\text{Shoplifters} = 4x - 5 
\]
Substituting \( x = 3 \):
\[ 
\text{Shoplifters} = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 
\]

### 3
Now, we find the number of customers kicked out for physical violence. The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. Thus:
\[ 
\text{Violence} = 3 \times \text{Shoplifters} = 3 \times 7 = 21 
\]

### 4
Now we can calculate the total number of customers kicked out for the reasons we have identified:
- Mask refusal: \( 3 \)
- Shoplifting: \( 7 \)
- Physical violence: \( 21 \)

Adding these together gives:
\[ 
\text{Total} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 
\]

### 5
The total number of people kicked out of Walmart is given as 50. To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total we calculated from the overall total:
\[ 
\text{Other reasons} = 50 - 31 = 19

To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to determine how many apples she sold on Monday.

  

### 2

Lucy sells apples at $4 each. Given that she made $56 from selling apples on Monday, we can calculate the number of apples sold:

- Number of apples sold on Monday = Total earnings / Price per apple
- Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 / $4 = 14 apples

  

### 3

Next, we look at the apples picked on Tuesday. We know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

  

### 4

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

- Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
- Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * 12 = 24 apples

  

### 5

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:

- Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
- Total apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples

  

### 6

Thus, we have accounted for all the apples picked by Lucy over the three days, ensuring we included the apples sold on Monday as well.

First, we need to determine the total time Carol spent on each activity:

- **Writing a song:** 4 hours
- **Recording the song:** Half of 4 hours, which is 2 hours
- **Editing the song:** 90 minutes, which we convert to hours (90 minutes = 1.5 hours)

### 2
Next, we calculate the total work time by adding the time spent on each activity:

- Total time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
- Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours

### 3
Now, we perform the addition:

- Total time = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

### 4
Next, we find the percentage of the total work time that Carol spent editing:

- Time spent editing = 1.5 hours
- Percentage of editing time = (Time spent editing / Total time) × 100

### 5
We calculate the percentage:

- Percentage of editing time = (1.5 / 7.5) × 100 = 20%

First, calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when used for 8 hours.

- The power rating of the air conditioner is 900 watts.
- Daily usage is 8 hours.
- Daily energy consumption = Power (in watts) × Time (in hours) = 900 watts × 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

### 2

Convert the daily energy consumption from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours.

- 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
- Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours = 7200 watt-hours ÷ 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours.

### 3

Now, calculate the daily energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours.

- New usage time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours.
- Daily energy consumption with reduced usage = 900 watts × 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

- May has 4 weeks, so total pay for May = Total weekly pay × 4
- Total pay for May = $24,000 × 4 = $96,000

### 6

Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June.

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired = 40 × (1/4) = 10 employees

### 7

Determine the number of employees remaining in June.

- Remaining employees = Total employees - Expired contracts
- Remaining employees = 40 - 10 = 30 employees

### 8

Calculate the total weekly pay for the remaining employees in June.

- Total weekly pay for remaining employees = Weekly pay × Remaining employees
- Total weekly pay = $600 × 30 = $18,000

### 9

Calculate the total pay for the month of June.

- Total pay for June = Total weekly pay × 4
- Total pay for June = $18,000 × 4 = $72,000

### 10

Finally, calculate the total amount paid to employees over the two months.

- Total amount paid = Total pay for May + Total pay for June
- Total amount paid = $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

Misha picks out 4 blouses, each with a regular price of $20.  

### 2  
To find the total regular price for the 4 blouses, we multiply the price of one blouse by the number of blouses:  
\[ 
\text{Total regular price} = 4 \times 20 = 80 
\]  

### 3  
The blouses are on a 30% discount. To calculate the discount amount, we first find 30% of the regular price of one blouse:  
\[ 
\text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 
\]  

### 4  
Next, we subtract the discount from the regular price of one blouse to find the discounted price:  
\[ 
\text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 
\]  

### 5  
Now, we calculate the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses by multiplying the discounted price by the number of blouses:  
\[

Let’s define the number of apples Joanne gathers from each type of tree:

- Apples from tallest trees: 30
- Apples from shortest trees: 15 (half of 30)
- Apples from average trees: \( x \) (unknown)

### 2

Now, let's calculate how many apples Joanne gathers in total:

- Total apples gathered by Joanne = Apples from tallest + Apples from shortest + Apples from average
- Total apples gathered by Joanne = \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \)

### 3

Next, we calculate how many apples her sister gathers:

- Apples from tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Apples from shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- Apples from average trees: 0

### 4

Now, we can find the total apples gathered by her sister:

- Total apples gathered by sister = Apples from tallest + Apples from shortest + Apples from average
- Total apples gathered by sister = \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \)

### 5

Now, we can set up the equation for the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters:

- Combined total = Apples gathered by Joanne + Apples gathered by sister
- \( 500 = (45 + x) + 105 \)

### 6

Simplifying the equation:

- \( 500 = 150 + x \)

### 7

Now, solve for \( x \):

- \( x = 500 - 150 \)
- \( x = 350 \)

### 8

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:

- Apples from average trees = \( x = 350 \)

416,"To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given about the camels and dromedaries.

### 1. Define Variables

- Let \( c \) represent the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

### 2. Set Up Equations

- From the problem, we know that the total number of heads (camels + dromedaries) is 180:
  \[
  c + d = 180
  \]

- We also know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, leading to the total number of bumps being 304:
  \[
  2c + d = 304
  \]

### 3. Solve the First Equation for One Variable

- Rearranging the first equation gives:
  \[
  d = 180 - c
  \]

### 4. Substitute into the Second Equation

- Substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
  \[
  2c + (180 - c) = 304
  \]

### 5. Simplify the Equation

- Simplifying the equation:
  \[
  2c + 180 - c = 304
  \]
  \[
  c + 180 = 304
  \]
  \[
  c = 304 - 180
  \]
  \[
  c = 124
  \]

### 6. Find the Number of Dromedaries

- Substitute \( c \) back into the equation for \( d \):
  \[
  d = 180 - 124
  \]
  \[
  d = 56
  \]

### 7. Conclusion

- The number of dromedaries in the herd is 56.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. 

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

### 2
Now, let's add the costs of the items together:

- Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

### 3
Next, we will determine how much money Dora currently has.

- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

### 4
Now, let's add the money Dora has:

- Total money = $2 + $16 = $18

### 5
Now, we will find out how much more money Dora needs to buy all the items.

- Additional money needed = Total cost - Total money
- Additional money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

### 6
Thus, the final result is that Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

### 1. Calculate Total Money Spent

- George spent a total of $5.
- He has 1% of his money left after spending.
- 1% of $5 is $0.05.

### 2. Determine Money Spent on Chips

- George bought 3 bags of chips.
- Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40.
- Total cost for chips = 3 bags × $0.40/bag = $1.20.

### 3. Calculate Money Spent on Candy Bars

- Total money spent = $5 - $0.05 (remaining money) = $4.95.
- Money spent on candy bars = Total money spent - Money spent on chips.
- Money spent on candy bars = $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

### 4. Determine Cost of Candy Bars

- Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.
- To find the number of candy bars bought, divide the total spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar.
- Number of candy bars = $3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

### 5. Conclusion

- George bought 5 candy bars.

Antoine's original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. Since he likes to double that amount, we calculate the total amount of onions needed:

- **Total onions needed** = 2 pounds × 2 = 4 pounds


### 2

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The price of onions is $2.00 per pound:

- **Cost of onions** = 4 pounds × $2.00/pound = $8.00


### 3

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are priced at $2.00 per box:

- **Cost of beef stock** = 2 boxes × $2.00/box = $4.00


### 4

Now, we can find the total cost of the ingredients by adding the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock:

- **Total cost** = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00


### 5

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

- **Cost per serving** = Total cost / Number of servings = $12.00 / 6 = $2.00

Finally, we round the cost per serving to the nearest integer, which in this case remains $2.00.

**Step 2** Determine the total cost of the regular ticket option.  

- The regular movie ticket costs $12.  
- The soda costs $3.  
- Let \( P \) represent the regular price of popcorn.

Let's define the variables:

- Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
- According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the formula: 

\[
\text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2
\]

### 2

Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}c + 2 = 5
\]

### 3

Next, we will solve for \( c \):

- First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}c = 5 - 2
\]

- This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2}c = 3
\]

### 4

Now, to isolate \( c \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
c = 3 \times 2

- The shark's length is 10 feet.  
- Each remora is 6 inches long.  
- There are 2 remoras attached to the shark.  

  

**Step 2** Convert all measurements to the same unit.  

- 10 feet = 10 × 12 inches = 120 inches.  
- Each remora is already in inches (6 inches).  
- Therefore, the total length of the remoras is 2 × 6 inches = 12 inches.  

  

**Step 3** Calculate the combined length of the remoras as a percentage of the shark's length.  

- The formula for percentage is:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
  \]  
- Here, the ""Part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) and the ""Whole"" is the shark's length (120 inches).  

  

**Step 4** Substitute the values into the percentage formula.  

- Using the values:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100

**Step 5** Simplify the calculation.

- Let the total number of students be represented as \( x \).  
- Since one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers, the number of students without desktop computers can be expressed as \( \frac{1}{4}x \).  

  
**Step 3** Set up the equation based on the given information.

Let the cost of the lot be represented as \( x \). 

### 2

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can express the cost of the house as \( 3x \). 

### 3

The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 3x = 120,000
\]

### 4

Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[
4x = 120,000
\]

### 5

To find the value of \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
\]

### 6

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( x \) back into the equation for the house:

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 3x = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
\]

### 7

Thus, the cost of the house is $90,000. 

### 8

To verify, we can check the total cost:

\[
\text{Cost of the lot} + \text{Cost of the house} = 30,000 + 90,000 = 120,000

529,"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we can follow these reasoning steps:

  

### 1. Identify the total amount spent

- Tom spent a total of $48 on a CD and a headphone set. 

  

### 2. Determine the cost of the CD

- The cost of one CD is given as $4. 

  

### 3. Calculate the cost of the headphone set

- Let the cost of the headphone set be represented as \( H \). Therefore, the equation can be set up as:
  \[
  4 + H = 48
  \]

  

### 4. Solve for the cost of the headphone set

- Rearranging the equation gives:
  \[
  H = 48 - 4 = 44
  \]
- Thus, the headphone set costs $44. 

  

### 5. Calculate the remaining amount if the headphone set was not purchased

- If Tom did not buy the headphone set, he would have the entire $48 to spend on CDs. 

  

### 6. Determine how many CDs can be bought with $48

- To find out how many CDs Tom could buy with $48, we divide the total amount by the cost of one CD:
  \[
  \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12

### 7. Calculate the number of CDs originally bought

- Tom originally bought 1 CD. 

  

### 8. Calculate how many more CDs he could have bought

- The additional number of CDs he could have bought is:

- There are initially 48 people riding the bus.  

  

**Step 2** Passengers getting off at the first stop  

- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off the bus.  
- Therefore, the number of passengers remaining after this stop is:  
  \( 48 - 8 = 40 \) passengers.  

  

**Step 3** Passengers getting on at the first stop  

- According to the problem, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus.  
- Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:  
  \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) passengers.  

  

**Step 4** Total passengers after the first stop  

- After the first stop, the total number of passengers on the bus is:  
  \( 40 + 40 = 80 \) passengers.  

  

**Step 5** Passengers getting off at the second stop  

- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off the bus.  
- The number of passengers remaining after this stop is:  
  \( 80 - 21 = 59 \) passengers.  

  

**Step 6** Passengers getting on at the second stop  

- The problem states that 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off.  
- Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:  
  \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers.  

  

**Step 7** Total passengers after the second stop  

- After the second stop, the total number of passengers on the bus is:

### 1. Identify Jame's current age

- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, which means he is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old. 

  

### 2. Determine Jame's age in 8 years

- In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. 

  

### 3. Set up the equation for his cousin's age

- According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
- Therefore, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years can be expressed as: 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old. 

  

### 4. Determine the cousin's current age

- If Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, we can find the cousin's current age by subtracting 8 from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years old. 

  

### 5. Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin

- Now that we know Jame is currently 22 years old and his cousin is currently 47 years old, we can find the age difference: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

533,"**Step 1** Identify the cost of the computer.  

- The problem states that the computer cost $1,100.  

  
**Step 2** Determine the cost of the printer.  

- It is given that the printer cost $400 less than the computer.  
- Therefore, the cost of the printer is:  
  \[ 
  \text{Cost of printer} = \text{Cost of computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 
  \]  

  
**Step 3** Calculate the total cost of the computer and printer.  

- Now, we can find the total cost of the computer and printer:  
  \[ 
  \text{Total cost of computer and printer} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800 
  \]  

  
**Step 4** Find the total cost allocated to the monitors.  

- The total amount Errol spent on the computer, monitors, and printer is $2,400.  
- To find the total cost of the monitors, we subtract the total cost of the computer and printer from the total amount spent:  
  \[ 
  \text{Total cost of monitors} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Total cost of computer and printer} = 2400 - 1800 = 600 
  \]  

  
**Step 5** Determine the cost of one monitor.  

- Errol bought 2 monitors, so to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2:  
  \[ 
  \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{\text{Total cost of monitors}}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300

541,"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we can break down the problem as follows:

  

**1. Identify the number of days in April**  
- April has 30 days.  

  

**2. Divide the month into two halves**  
- The first half consists of the first 15 days (April 1-15).  
- The second half consists of the last 15 days (April 16-30).  

  

**3. Set up the saving target**  
- Elvis's total saving target for April is $1125.  

  

**4. Define daily savings in the first half**  
- Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.  
- Therefore, his total savings for the first half is \( 15x \).  

  

**5. Define daily savings in the second half**  
- In the second half, he saves twice as much, so he saves \( 2x \) each day.  
- His total savings for the second half is \( 15(2x) = 30x \).  

  

**6. Set up the equation for total savings**  
- The total savings for the month can be expressed as:  
  \[
  15x + 30x = 1125
  \]  
- This simplifies to:  
  \[
  45x = 1125
  \]  

  

**7. Solve for \( x \)**  
- To find \( x \), divide both sides by 45:  
  \[
  x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
  \]  

  

**8. Calculate daily savings for the second half**  
- Since he saves \( 2x \) in the second half:  
  \[
  2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
  \]  

  

**9. Conclusion**  
- Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his target.

Let the amount of money Brad receives be represented as \( x \).

  

### 2

Since Jeff receives 4 times as much as Brad, we can express Jeff's amount as \( 4x \).

  

### 3

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

\[
x + 4x = 100
\]

  

### 4

Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[
5x = 100
\]

  

### 5

To find the value of \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
x = \frac{100}{5} = 20

### 6

Now that we know Brad receives \( x = 20 \) dollars, we can find out how much Jeff receives:

\text{Mitchell's Earnings} = 21 \times 4 
\]

### 3
Calculating the multiplication:

\[ 
21 \times 4 = 84 
\]

So, Mitchell made $84 selling lemonade.

### 4
Next, we compare Mitchell's earnings to Liam's earnings. Liam made $63.

### 5
To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 
\text{Difference} = \text{Mitchell's Earnings} - \text{Liam's Earnings} 
\]

### 6
Substituting the values we have:

\[ 
\text{Difference} = 84 - 63

580,"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to for a recipe calling for 520 degrees, we can follow these steps:

  

**1. Identify the actual temperature discrepancy**  
- Maggie sets her oven to 450 degrees, but the actual temperature is 468 degrees.  
- The difference is: 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.  

  

**2. Calculate the percentage error**  
- To find the percentage error, we use the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
  \]  
- Plugging in the values:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \approx 4\%
  \]  

  

**3. Apply the percentage error to the new recipe temperature**  
- The recipe calls for 520 degrees.  
- We need to find out what set temperature will result in the actual temperature being 520 degrees, considering the 4% error.  

  

**4. Set up the equation for the new temperature**  
- Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set.  
- The actual temperature when she sets it to \( x \) will be:  
  \[
  x + 0.04x = 520
  \]  
- This simplifies to:  
  \[
  1.04x = 520
  \]  

  

**5. Solve for \( x \)**  
- To find \( x \), divide both sides by 1.04:  
  \[
  x = \frac{520}{1.04} \approx 500
  \]  

  

**6. Conclusion**  
- Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to approximately 500 degrees to achieve the desired actual temperature of 520 degrees.

Let the number of blue jelly beans be represented as \( b \).

  

### 2

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans \( r \) is given by:

\[ r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b \]

  

### 3

The number of green jelly beans \( g \) is given by:

\[ g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b \]

  

### 4

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:

\[ r + b + g = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \):

\[ 0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500 \]

  

### 5

Combine the terms:

\[ (0.99b + b + 1.01b) = 2b \]

So, we have:

\[ 2b = 4500 \]

  

### 6

Now, solve for \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{4500}{2} = 2250 \]

  

### 7

Now, substitute \( b \) back to find \( r \) and \( g \):

- For red jelly beans:

\[ r = 0.99 \times 2250 = 2227.5 \]

- For green jelly beans:

\[ g = 1.01 \times 2250 = 2272.5 \]

  

### 8

Now, calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans:

- The third angle, which is three times the smallest angle, is \( 3x \).

  

# 2. Set up the equation based on the triangle angle sum property

According to the triangle angle sum property, the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

# 3. Simplify the equation

Combining like terms in the equation gives us:

- Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
- To find his hourly rate, divide the total pounds by the number of hours:  
  \( \text{Rate of Ruiz} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \)

  
# 2. Calculate Marissa's chocolate production rate

- Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours.
- Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, Marissa's hourly rate is:  
  \( \text{Rate of Marissa} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds/hour} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \)

  
# 3. Calculate the total chocolate production for Ruiz in 12 hours

- To find the total amount of chocolate Ruiz makes in 12 hours, multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours:  
  \( \text{Total for Ruiz} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \)

  
# 4. Calculate the total chocolate production for Marissa in 12 hours

- Similarly, calculate the total amount of chocolate Marissa makes in 12 hours:  
  \( \text{Total for Marissa} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \)

  
# 5. Calculate the combined total chocolate production

- To find the total amount of chocolate they made together, add the totals from Ruiz and Marissa:

- Ashley's internet connection speed is given as 20 kb/s (kilobits per second).  

  
**Step 2** Convert kilobits per second to kilobits per hour.  

- To find the speed in kilobits per hour, multiply the speed in kilobits per second by the number of seconds in an hour.  
- There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour).  
- Calculation: 20 kb/s * 3600 s/hour = 72,000 kb/hour.  

  
**Step 3** Convert kilobits per hour to megabits per hour.  

- Since 1 Mb (megabit) is equal to 1000 kb (kilobits), we need to convert kilobits to megabits.  
- To convert kilobits to megabits, divide the total kilobits by 1000.  
- Calculation: 72,000 kb/hour ÷ 1000 = 72 Mb/hour.  

  
**Step 4** State the final result.

- The tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days.  
- Therefore, the total for these three days is:  
  \( 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \)  


**Step 2** Determine the number of cars towed on the remaining days.  

- There are 7 days in a week, so the remaining days after the first three are:  
  \( 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ days} \)  
- The tow truck towed 4 fewer cars on each of these days compared to the first three days:  
  \( 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ cars/day} \)  


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of cars towed on the remaining days.  

- For the remaining 4 days, the total number of cars towed is:  
  \( 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \)  


**Step 4** Add the totals from both parts of the week.  

- The total number of cars towed for the entire week is:

### 1. Identify Paisley's distance
- Paisley ran a total of 4 miles.

### 2. Calculate Reggie's distance
- Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
- Therefore, Reggie's distance = 5 * 4 miles = 20 miles.

### 3. Set up the equation for Lynn's distance
- We know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.
- Let Lynn's distance be represented as \( L \).
- The relationship can be expressed as: 
  \[
  R = L + 3
  \]
  where \( R \) is Reggie's distance.

### 4. Substitute Reggie's distance into the equation
- We already calculated Reggie's distance as 20 miles.
- Substitute \( R \) in the equation:
  \[
  20 = L + 3
  \]

### 5. Solve for Lynn's distance
- Rearranging the equation gives:
  \[
  L = 20 - 3

660,"To solve the problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given about the legs and heads of the animals.

  

**1. Identify the variables**  
- Let \( s \) represent the number of sheep.  
- Let \( g \) represent the number of geese.  

  

**2. Set up the equations based on heads**  
- Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads can be expressed as:  
  \[ s + g = 20 \]  

  

**3. Set up the equations based on legs**  
- Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Thus, the total number of legs can be expressed as:  
  \[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]  

  

**4. Simplify the legs equation**  
- We can simplify the legs equation by dividing everything by 2:  
  \[ 2s + g = 35 \]  

  

**5. Solve the system of equations**  
- Now we have two equations:  
  1. \( s + g = 20 \)  
  2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)  

- We can subtract the first equation from the second:  
  \[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]  
  \[ s = 15 \]  

  

**6. Substitute back to find the number of geese**  
- Now that we have \( s = 15 \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( g \):  
  \[ 15 + g = 20 \]  
  \[ g = 5 \]  

  

**7. Verify the solution**  
- Check the total number of legs:  
  \[ 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]  
- Check the total number of heads:  
  \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]  
- Both conditions are satisfied.

- The calculations confirm that the number of sheep is correct.

To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the amount of each ingredient required for one muffin.

### 2

For one muffin, the dry ingredients are as follows:

- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

### 3

Next, we will calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for 16 muffins by multiplying the amount needed for one muffin by 16.

### 4

Calculating the total for each ingredient:

- Total flour: \( 5 \text{ tablespoons} \times 16 = 80 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Total sugar: \( 3 \text{ tablespoons} \times 16 = 48 \text{ tablespoons} \)
- Total salt: \( 0.25 \text{ tablespoons} \times 16 = 4 \text{ tablespoons} \)

### 5

Now, we will sum the total amounts of all dry ingredients:

- Total dry ingredients = Total flour + Total sugar + Total salt
- Total dry ingredients = \( 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \)

### 6

- From the problem, we know that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns.  
- This gives us a ratio of potatoes to hash browns: 6 potatoes = 36 hash browns.  

  
**Step 2** Calculate the number of hash browns per potato.  

- To find out how many hash browns one potato can make, we divide the number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:  
  - \( \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \).  

  
**Step 3** Determine the total number of hash browns from 96 potatoes.  

- Now that we know each potato makes 6 hash browns, we can calculate the total for 96 potatoes:  
  - \( 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \).  

  
**Step 4** Verify the calculation.  

- To ensure accuracy, we can double-check the multiplication:  
  - \( 96 \times 6 = 576 \).  
- This confirms that our previous calculation is correct.  

  
**Step 5** State the final result.  

- Based on the calculations, we conclude that 96 potatoes can produce 576 hash browns.

Let the age of one twin be \( T \) and the age of one triplet be \( R \). 

### 2
According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This can be expressed as:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

### 3
There is one set of twins and one set of triplets. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can denote the ages of the twins as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) (both equal to \( T \)), and the ages of the triplets as \( R_1, R_2, R_3 \) (all equal to \( R \)).

### 4
The combined ages of the twins and triplets is given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

### 5
Now, we can substitute the expression for \( T \) from step 2 into the equation from step 4:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

### 6
Expanding this equation gives:
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]

### 7
Combining like terms results in:
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]

### 8
To isolate \( R \), subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 5R = 30 \]

### 9
Now, divide both sides by 5 to find \( R \):
\[ R = 6 \]

Using the value of \( R \) to find \( T \):
\[ T = R + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

- Additional friends: 7

Total number of people:

\[
1 + 12 + 7 = 20
\]


### 2

Next, we need to calculate the total number of seats required. Since each person saves a seat, the total number of seats is equal to the total number of people.

- Total seats = Total people = 20


### 3

Now, we need to find out how many drinks and snacks are needed for the group. Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

- Total drinks needed = Total seats × 2
- Total snacks needed = Total seats × 3

Calculating these:

\[
\text{Total drinks} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

\[
\text{Total snacks} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]


### 4

Next, we calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks. Each drink and snack costs $2.

- Total cost for drinks = Total drinks × Cost per drink
- Total cost for snacks = Total snacks × Cost per snack

Calculating these:

\[
\text{Total cost for drinks} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for snacks} = 60 \times 2 = 120
\]


### 5

Finally, we sum the total costs of drinks and snacks to find the overall amount spent by the group.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for drinks} + \text{Total cost for snacks}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 80 + 120 = 200
\]


### Final Result

The group has spent a total of \boxed{200} dollars on snacks and drinks.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream.

  

### 2
Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.

  

### 3
With the deal, if Erin buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 2 scoops she pays for, she receives a total of 3 scoops.

  

### 4
To find out how many scoops Erin can buy, we first calculate how many sets of 2 scoops she can afford with her $6.00.

  

### 5
The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 
2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/scoop} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} 
\]

  

### 6
Now, we determine how many sets of 2 scoops Erin can buy with $6.00:
\[ 
\frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{3.00 \text{ dollars/set}} = 2 \text{ sets} 
\]

  

### 7
Since each set of 2 scoops gives her 3 scoops, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
\[ 
2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} 
\]

  

### 8
Erin can spend her entire $6.00 on this deal, as she will have bought 6 scoops in total.

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

- Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches.
- Adding the 4 inches gives us \(96 + 4 = 100\) inches.

### 2

Next, we set up the equation based on the information given in the problem.

- Let \(B\) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
- According to the problem, Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
- This can be expressed as: 
  \[
  T = 9B + 10
  \]
- We know \(T = 100\) inches (from step 1).

### 3

Now, we substitute the value of \(T\) into the equation.

- The equation becomes:
  \[
  100 = 9B + 10
  \]

### 4

Next, we solve for \(B\).

- First, subtract 10 from both sides:
  \[
  100 - 10 = 9B
  \]
  \[
  90 = 9B
  \]

### 5

Now, divide both sides by 9 to find \(B\).

- This gives us:
  \[
  B = \frac{90}{9} = 10
  \]

### 6

Finally, we conclude that the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

First, calculate the total number of students' cars and their windows.

- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows for students' cars = 64 cars × 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

  

### 2

Next, calculate the total number of teachers' cars and their windows.

- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows for teachers' cars = 32 cars × 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

  

### 3

Now, determine how many windows Hannah smashes from the students' cars.

- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed from students' cars = 1/4 × 256 windows = 64 windows.

  

### 4

Next, calculate how many windows Hannah smashes from the teachers' cars.

- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Windows smashed from teachers' cars = 3/4 × 64 windows = 48 windows.

  

### 5

Finally, add the total number of smashed windows from both students' and teachers' cars.

- Total smashed windows = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

728,"# 1. Identify the total number of spools

Candy has the following spools of thread:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

To find the total number of spools, we add these amounts together:

\[
15 + 45 + 40 + 50
\]


# 2. Calculate the total number of spools

Calculating the total:

\[
15 + 45 = 60
\]

\[
60 + 40 = 100
\]

\[
100 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total number of spools is 150.


# 3. Identify the total number of blue spools

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools. Blue spools include both light blue and dark blue:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45

Adding these together gives:

\[
15 + 45 = 60
\]

So, the total number of blue spools is 60.


# 4. Calculate the percentage of blue spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]


# 5. Simplify the fraction

Now, we simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now we can calculate the percentage:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]


# 6. State the final result

Thus, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is:

- Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. 

  

# 2. Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons
- Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers. 
- 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers traded. 
- She has 3 small stickers left (30 - 27 = 3).
- Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she receives 27 large buttons from trading her small stickers. 

  

# 3. Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons
- Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers. 
- 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers traded. 
- She has 20 large stickers left (40 - 20 = 20).
- Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she receives 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers. 

  

# 4. Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons
- Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. 
- Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she receives 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.

Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the regulation. Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is \( 2x \) since it passed with twice as many votes in favor as against.

  

# 2. Set up the equation

The total number of council members is 33. Therefore, the equation representing the total votes is:

\[
x + 2x = 33
\]

  

# 3. Simplify the equation

Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[
3x = 33

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of votes in favor:

- Krissa has 11 students who need size extra-small.  
- Let \( E = 11 \) (where \( E \) represents extra-small).  

  

**Step 2** Calculate the number of students needing small shirts.  

- The problem states that twice as many students need size small as extra-small.  
- Therefore, \( S = 2 \times E = 2 \times 11 = 22 \) (where \( S \) represents small).  

  

**Step 3** Determine the number of students needing medium shirts.  

- It is given that four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  
- Thus, \( M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 \) (where \( M \) represents medium).  

  

**Step 4** Find the number of students needing large shirts.  

- The problem states that half as many students need size large as size medium.  
- Therefore, \( L = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) (where \( L \) represents large).  

  

**Step 5** Calculate the number of students needing extra-large shirts.  

- It is mentioned that six more students need size extra-large than large.  
- Thus, \( XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \) (where \( XL \) represents extra-large).  

  

**Step 6** Sum the total number of shirts ordered.  

- Now, we add all the students needing each shirt size:  
  - Total = \( E + S + M + L + XL = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 \)  
- Calculating this gives:  
  - Total = \( 11 + 22 = 33 \)  
  - \( 33 + 18 = 51 \)  
  - \( 51 + 9 = 60 \)

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{2}{3}x
\]

  

### 3

It is stated that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Thus, the number of Pomeranian girls can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranian girls} = \frac{1}{3} \times \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) = \frac{2}{9}x
\]

  

### 4

We know from the problem that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{9}x = 6
\]

  

### 5

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

\[
2x = 54

### 6

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):

\[

Let’s define the variables for the number of cases of shingles needed for each house:

- Let \( x \) be the number of cases needed for the first house.
- The second house will then need \( 2x \) (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house will need \( 2x \) (since it needs double the first house).

### 2

Now, we can express the total number of cases needed for all three houses:

- Total cases = Cases for first house + Cases for second house + Cases for third house
- This can be written as: \( x + 2x + 2x = 5x \)

### 3

We know from the problem statement that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250:

- Therefore, we can set up the equation: \( 5x = 250 \)

### 4

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

- Divide both sides by 5:

  \text{Movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
  \]  

  

**Step 3** Determine the cost for the series movies.  

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each:  
  \[
  \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
  \]  

  

**Step 4** Calculate the number of remaining movies.  

- The remaining movies after accounting for the series:  
  \[
  \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
  \]  

  

**Step 5** Determine the number of older movies.  

- 40% of the remaining movies are older movies:  
  \[
  \text{Older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
  \]  

  

**Step 6** Calculate the cost for the older movies.  

- The cost for the older movies is $5 each:  
  \[
  \text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
  \]  

  

**Step 7** Calculate the number of newer movies.  

- The number of newer movies is the remaining after older movies:  
  \[
  \text{Newer movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
  \]  

  

**Step 8** Determine the cost for the newer movies.  

- The cost for the newer movies is $10 each:  
  \[
  \text{Cost for newer movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
  \]  

  

**Step 9** Calculate the total cost of replacing all movies.  

- The total cost is the sum of the costs for series, older, and newer movies:  
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
  \]

779,"# 1. Determine the total time spent driving and hiking

The Llesis family spent a total of 6 hours traveling to their vacation spot, which includes both driving and hiking time.

  

# 2. Identify the hiking time

It is given that they took 1.5 hours to hike. 

  

# 3. Calculate the driving time

To find the driving time, subtract the hiking time from the total time:  
Total time = 6 hours  
Hiking time = 1.5 hours  
Driving time = 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours  

  

# 4. Determine the driving speed

The average driving speed is given as 50 miles per hour.  

  

# 5. Calculate the distance driven

Using the formula for distance (Distance = Speed × Time), we can calculate the distance driven:  
Distance driven = Driving speed × Driving time  
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 225 miles  

  

# 6. Determine the hiking speed

The hiking speed is stated to be 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.  
Half the driving speed = 50 miles/hour ÷ 2 = 25 miles/hour  
Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour  

  

# 7. Calculate the distance hiked

Using the same distance formula, we can calculate the distance hiked:  
Distance hiked = Hiking speed × Hiking time  
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles  

  

# 8. Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:  
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked  
Total distance = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles

- Each player scores points based on three criteria:
  - 10 points for each enemy jumped on
  - 5 points for each berry collected
  - 30 points for each second left on the timer

  

# 2. Establish variables for scores
- Let:
  - \( E_E \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
  - \( B_E \) = number of berries Emma collects
  - \( T_E \) = seconds left for Emma
  - \( E_A = E_E + 8 \) = number of enemies Ava jumps on (8 more than Emma)
  - \( B_A = B_E + 3 \) = number of berries Ava collects (3 more than Emma)
  - \( T_A = T_E - 4 \) = seconds left for Ava (4 seconds slower than Emma)

  

# 3. Calculate Emma's score
- Emma's score can be calculated as:
  \[
  S_E = 10 \cdot E_E + 5 \cdot B_E + 30 \cdot T_E
  \]

  

# 4. Calculate Ava's score
- Ava's score can be calculated as:
  \[
  S_A = 10 \cdot (E_E + 8) + 5 \cdot (B_E + 3) + 30 \cdot (T_E - 4)
  \]
- Simplifying Ava's score:
  \[
  S_A = 10 \cdot E_E + 80 + 5 \cdot B_E + 15 + 30 \cdot T_E - 120
  \]
  \[
  S_A = S_E + 80 + 15 - 120 = S_E - 25

# 5. Determine the difference in scores
- The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
  \[
  S_A - S_E = (S_E - 25) - S_E = -25
  \]

  

# 6. Conclusion
- The difference in scores indicates that Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

First, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. 

- She has:
  - 3 stuffed puppies
  - 5 stuffed koalas
  - 2 stuffed zebras
  - 4 stuffed frogs

### 2
Now, we add these numbers together to find the total:

- Total = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals.

### 3
Next, we denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \).

- After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the new total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

### 4
We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

- The equation for this is:
  \[
  \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
  \]

### 5
To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

- This gives us:
  \[
  x = 0.30(14 + x)
  \]

### 6
Now, we distribute \( 0.30 \) on the right side:

- This results in:
  \[
  x = 4.2 + 0.30x
  \]

### 7
Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

- This gives us:
  \[
  x - 0.30x = 4.2
  \]
- Simplifying this, we have:
  \[
  0.70x = 4.2
  \]

### 8
Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by \( 0.70 \):

- This results in:
  \[
  x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
  \]

### 9
Thus, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to ensure that they make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.

- The new total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + 6 = 20 \).
- The number of stuffed goats will be \( 6 \), which is \( 30\% \) of \( 20 \).

Therefore, the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy is \boxed{6}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints4MathFormat'}

Since \( z = f \), we can express fragrance as:

From \( s = 2z \), we can express salt as:

Let the number of cards PJ has be represented as \( x \). 

- This means Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards (since he has three times the amount of PJ).
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards (since she has 12 more than Smendrick).

### 2

Set up the equation based on the total number of cards.

- The total number of cards is given as 341.
- Therefore, we can write the equation:  
  \[
  x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341
  \]

### 3

Combine like terms in the equation.

- Simplifying the left side gives:  
  \[
  7x + 12 = 341
  \]

### 4

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 12 from both sides.

- This results in:  
  \[
  7x = 341 - 12
  \]
- Which simplifies to:  
  \[
  7x = 329
  \]

### 5

Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 7.

- Thus, we have:  
  \[
  x = \frac{329}{7} = 47

### 6

Now calculate the number of cards each person has.

- PJ has \( x = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

### 7

Verify the total number of cards.

- Adding them together:

## 1. Calculate the shipping cost per pound
The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. Since the book weighs 4 pounds, the shipping cost for the weight is:

\[
\text{Shipping cost for weight} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.4 \text{ dollars}
\]

## 2. Calculate the shipping cost per mile
The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the shipping cost for the distance is:

\[
\text{Shipping cost for distance} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.6 \text{ dollars}
\]

## 3. Calculate the total shipping cost
Now, we add the shipping cost for weight and the shipping cost for distance to find the total shipping cost:

\[
\text{Total shipping cost} = 1.4 \text{ dollars} + 1.6 \text{ dollars} = 3.0 \text{ dollars}
\]

## 4. Calculate the refund amount from Amazon
Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

## 5. Calculate Milly's total loss
To find out how much money Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the total shipping cost:

\[
\text{Total loss} = \text{Total shipping cost} + \text{Cost of the book} - \text{Refund amount}
\]

First, we need to find the total cost incurred:

\[
\text{Total cost incurred} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3.0 \text{ dollars} = 35.0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the loss:

\[
\text{Total loss} = 35.0 \text{ dollars} - 24.0 \text{ dollars} = 11.0 \text{ dollars}

- It takes 3 kangaroos a total of 18 hours to cross the highway.

  

# 2. Calculate the speed of the kangaroos

- Since the travel time is the same for all kangaroos, we can say that the speed of the kangaroos is constant.
- The total time taken by the kangaroos is 18 hours, which means each kangaroo effectively contributes to the same travel distance in that time.

  

# 3. Establish the relationship between speed and time

- The distance traveled by the kangaroos can be represented as:  
  \[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
- Let \( D \) be the distance across the highway and \( S_k \) be the speed of a kangaroo.  
  Thus, \( D = S_k \times 18 \).

  

# 4. Determine the speed of the turtles

- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo:  
  \[ S_t = \frac{1}{2} S_k \]

  

# 5. Calculate the time it takes for turtles to travel the same distance

- Using the same distance formula for turtles:  
  \[ D = S_t \times T_t \]
- Substituting \( S_t \) into the equation gives:  
  \[ D = \left(\frac{1}{2} S_k\right) \times T_t \]

  

# 6. Set the equations for distance equal to each other

- Since both equations represent the same distance \( D \):  
  \[ S_k \times 18 = \left(\frac{1}{2} S_k\right) \times T_t \]

  

# 7. Solve for \( T_t \)

- Rearranging the equation:  
  \[ T_t = \frac{S_k \times 18}{\frac{1}{2} S_k} \]
- Simplifying gives:  
  \[ T_t = 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

  

# 8. Conclusion

- Therefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of 36 hours to cross the highway.

Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. 

### 2
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone. 

- Total cost = Cost of car + Cost of phone  
- Total cost = $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

### 3
Gabriel has some money saved up and some help from his brother. 

- Money from working = $5,000  
- Money from brother = $200  
- Total money Gabriel has = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

### 4
Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs. 

- Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has  
- Money needed = $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

### 5
Thus, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy both the car and the phone.

- Let the number of socks Jack has be represented as \( S_J \).
- According to the problem, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:  
  \( S_P = 2 \times S_J \).

### 2

- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks:  
  \( D_J = 2 \times S_J \).
- We know from the problem that Jack collected 60 dishes:  
  \( D_J = 60 \).

### 3

- Set up the equation based on Jack's dishes:  
  \( 2 \times S_J = 60 \).
- Solve for \( S_J \):  
  \( S_J = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

### 4

- Now calculate the number of socks Peter has:  
  \( S_P = 2 \times S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).

### 5

- Next, determine the number of dishes Peter has.  
- Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:  
  \( D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times D_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \).

### 6

- Now, calculate the total number of socks and dishes for both Peter and Jack:  
  - Total socks: \( S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90 \).
  - Total dishes: \( D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90 \).

- Simple interest is calculated using the formula:  
  \[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]  
- In this case, the principal (initial investment) is $300.

  

# 2. Identifying the Interest Rate

- The interest rate given is three-quarters of the original amount per year.  
- This translates to:  
  \[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\% \]  

  

# 3. Determining the Time Period

- The time period for which the interest is calculated is 3 years.  

  

# 4. Calculating the Total Interest

- Using the simple interest formula:  
  \[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]  
- Performing the calculation:  
  \[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 = 225 \]  
- Then,  
  \[ \text{Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]  

  

# 5. Calculating the Total Amount

- The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest earned:  
  \[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]  
- Therefore:  
  \[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

### 2

Calculate the total burritos consumed by the students.

- Total burritos consumed by students = Number of students × Burritos per student
- Total burritos consumed by students = 50 × 10 = 500 burritos.

### 3

Next, account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George.

- Mr. George eats 20 burritos.

### 4

Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.

- Total burritos consumed = Burritos consumed by students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George
- Total burritos consumed = 500 + 20 = 520 burritos.

### 5

Now, find the total number of leftover burritos.

- Total leftover burritos = Total ordered burritos - Total consumed burritos
- Total leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80 burritos.

Let the number of books that Anne has be represented as \( A \).

### 2
According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. Therefore, we can express the number of books Sofie has as:
\[ S = A + 25 \]

### 3
The problem also states that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. We can express the number of books Fawn has as:
\[ F = A + 12 \]

### 4
Now, we know the total number of books they have together is 85. We can set up the equation:
\[ S + A + F = 85 \]

### 5
Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( F \) into the total books equation gives us:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

### 6
Simplifying this equation:
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

### 7
Subtracting 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

### 8
Dividing both sides by 3 to find \( A \):
\[ A = 16 \]

### 9
Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( F \):
\[ F = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Identify the relationships between the spinning speeds of the objects:

- Let the speed of the thingamabob be represented as \( T \).
- The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so its speed is \( 5T \).
- The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is \( 11T \).

### 2

Set up the equation based on the speed of the whatchamacallit:

- We know that the speed of the whatchamacallit is given as 121 meters per second.
- Therefore, we can write the equation: \( 11T = 121 \).

### 3

Solve for the speed of the thingamabob:

- To find \( T \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:
  
  \[
  T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
  \]

### 4

Calculate the speed of the whirligig:

- Now that we have the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig:
  
  \[
  5T = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
  \]

### 1. Calculate the material needed for small masks

- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \).

  

### 2. Calculate the total material for 20 small masks

- For 20 small masks, the total material required is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

  

### 3. Calculate the material needed for large masks

- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \).

  

### 4. Calculate the total material for 8 large masks

- For 8 large masks, the total material required is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

  

### 5. Calculate the total material needed for all masks

- The total material needed for both small and large masks is \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.

### 2

Now, we calculate the total number of tickets she purchased.

- Total tickets = Number of movies × Number of times seen per movie
- Total tickets = 9 movies × 3 times = 27 tickets.

### 3

Next, we know the total amount Deepa spent on tickets.

- Total amount spent = $216.

### 4

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

- Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total tickets
- Average price per ticket = $216 / 27.

  - There are 6 pairs of balloons in a dozen (12 / 2 = 6).
  - Therefore, the total cost for 1 dozen balloons is 6 * $0.5 = $3.

  
# 3. Calculate the total cost of the ice cream
- Each tub of ice cream costs $7, and they bought 2 tubs:
  - Total cost for ice cream = 2 * $7 = $14.

  
# 4. Calculate the total expenditure
- Now, add up all the costs:
  - Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
  - Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

  
# 5. Determine the total allowance combined
- Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances, let’s denote each allowance as \( x \).
- Therefore, their combined allowance is \( 2x \).

  
# 6. Set up the equation
- We know that their combined allowance equals the total expenditure:
  - \( 2x = 28 \).

  
# 7. Solve for each allowance
- To find the allowance for each girl, divide both sides of the equation by 2:
  - \( x = 28 / 2 = 14 \).

  
# 8. Conclusion
- Each girl received an allowance of $14 from their mother.

### 4
Calculating Craig's brother's total letters:
\[ 
\text{Total letters by brother} = 300 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 350 \text{ letters} 
\]

### 5
Now, we need to find the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother combined.

### 6
Calculating the combined total letters:
\[ 
\text{Total letters combined} = \text{Total letters by Craig} + \text{Total letters by brother} 
\]
\[ 
\text{Total letters combined} = 300 \text{ letters} + 350 \text{ letters} = 650 \text{ letters} 
\]

### 7
Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650.

**1. Identify Deanna's age**  
- We know from the problem that Deanna is 26 years old.  

  

**2. Determine Marcus's age**  
- The problem states that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.  
- Therefore, Marcus's age can be calculated as:  
  \[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]  

  

**3. Relate Marcus's age to Leo's age**

- Let \( B \) be the points scored by Bahati.
- Let \( A \) be the points scored by Azibo.
- Let \( D \) be the points scored by Dinar.

  

# 2. Set up the equations based on the problem statement

- We know that the total points scored by all three is 45:
  \[
  B + A + D = 45
  \]

- Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
  \[
  B = A + 20
  \]

- Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
  \[
  B = D + 10
  \]

  

# 3. Substitute Bahati's score in terms of Azibo's score

- From the equation \( B = A + 20 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the total points equation:
  \[
  (A + 20) + A + D = 45
  \]

  

# 4. Substitute Dinar's score in terms of Bahati's score

- From the equation \( B = D + 10 \), we can express \( D \) as:
  \[
  D = B - 10
  \]
  
- Now substitute \( B \) from the first substitution:
  \[
  D = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10
  \]

  

# 5. Substitute Dinar's score back into the total points equation

- Now we can substitute \( D \) in the total points equation:
  \[
  (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
  \]

  

# 6. Simplify the equation

- Combine like terms:
  \[
  3A + 30 = 45
  \]

  

# 7. Solve for Azibo's score

- Subtract 30 from both sides:
  \[
  3A = 15
  \]

- Divide by 3:
  \[
  A = 5
  \]

  

# 8. Verify the scores

- Calculate Bahati's score:
  \[
  B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25
  \]

- Calculate Dinar's score:
  \[
  D = A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15
  \]

- Check the total:
  \[
  B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45

963,"**Step 1** Identify the variables.  

- Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.  
- Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.  
- Let \( X \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.  

  

**Step 2** Set up the equations based on the problem statement.  

- From the problem, we know that:  
  - \( A + S + X = 339 \) (total Pokemon caught)  
  - \( X = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)  
  - \( S = 4A - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught)  

  

**Step 3** Substitute the expression for \( X \) into the total equation.  

- Replace \( X \) in the total equation:  
  - \( A + S + (S + 5) = 339 \)  
- This simplifies to:  
  - \( A + 2S + 5 = 339 \)  
- Rearranging gives:  
  - \( A + 2S = 334 \)  

  

**Step 4** Substitute the expression for \( S \) into the modified total equation.  

- Replace \( S \) in the equation \( A + 2S = 334 \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):  
  - \( A + 2(4A - 13) = 334 \)  
- This simplifies to:  
  - \( A + 8A - 26 = 334 \)  
- Combining like terms gives:  
  - \( 9A - 26 = 334 \)  

  

**Step 5** Solve for \( A \).  

- Add 26 to both sides:  
  - \( 9A = 360 \)  
- Divide by 9:  
  - \( A = 40 \)  

  

**Step 6** Substitute \( A \) back to find \( S \).  

- Use \( S = 4A - 13 \):  
  - \( S = 4(40) - 13 \)  
- This simplifies to:  
  - \( S = 160 - 13 = 147 \)  

  

**Step 7** Verify the values.  

- Calculate \( X \) using \( X = S + 5 \):  
  - \( X = 147 + 5 = 152 \)  
- Check the total:  
  - \( A + S + X = 40 + 147 + 152 = 339 \) (correct)  

  

**Step 8** State the final result.  

- The calculations confirm that the values are consistent with the problem statement.

- Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long.  

  
**Step 2** Determine the total number of episodes.  

- The problem states that there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  
- Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).  

  
**Step 3** Calculate the total time spent watching the show.  

- To find the total time John will spend watching the show, multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode.  
- Total time = Number of episodes × Duration of each episode = \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) minutes.

Greta made a batch of brownies for herself, which consisted of **1 dozen** cream cheese swirl brownies. 

- 1 dozen = 12 brownies

### 2

At her office party, she received **1/2 a dozen** brownies to take home.

- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies

### 3

When she arrived home, her friends had prepared **4 dozen** brownies for her surprise party.

- 4 dozen = 48 brownies

### 4

During the party, a total of **1 1/2 dozen** brownies were eaten.

- 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

### 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before any were eaten:

- Brownies from herself: 12
- Brownies from the office: 6
- Brownies from friends: 48

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

### 6

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party from the total:

**1. Calculate the total soil used for sunflowers.**  
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.  
- They are planting 4 sunflowers.  
- Total soil used for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers × 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.  

  

**2. Calculate the total soil used for carnations.**  
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.  
- They are planting 10 carnations.  
- Total soil used for carnations = 10 carnations × 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.  

  

**3. Calculate the total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations.**  
- Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations.  
- Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.  

  

**4. Calculate the remaining soil available for roses.**  
- They started with a 30-pound bag of soil.  
- Remaining soil = Total soil - Total soil used.  
- Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.  

  

**5. Determine how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil.**  
- Each rose requires 1 pound of soil.  
- Number of roses that can be planted = Remaining soil / Soil per rose.  
- Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

- The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low.  
- It runs on low for 3 hours.  
- Total cooling on low = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.  

  

**Step 2** Calculate the temperature after running on low.  

- Let the starting temperature be T.  
- After 3 hours on low, the temperature is T - 6 degrees.  

  

**Step 3** Identify the cooling effect of the air conditioner on high.  

- The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high.  
- It runs on high for 4 hours.  
- Total cooling on high = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.  

  

**Step 4** Calculate the temperature after running on high.  

- After running on high, the temperature is (T - 6) - 12 degrees.  
- This simplifies to T - 18 degrees.  

  

**Step 5** Determine the warming effect when the air conditioner is turned off.  

- The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running.  
- The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.  
- Total warming = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.  

  

**Step 6** Calculate the final temperature after warming.

- Halley's Comet orbits the sun every 75 years.  
- This means it can be seen approximately every 75 years.  

  
**Step 2** Determine the age of Bill's dad when he first saw the Comet.  

- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.  
- This is the first instance of the Comet's appearance in his lifetime.  

  
**Step 3** Calculate Bill's dad's age during the second sighting of the Comet.  

- Since Halley's Comet appears every 75 years, Bill's dad would see it again when he is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.  

  
**Step 4** Determine Bill's age during the second sighting of the Comet.  

- Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw it.  
- Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the Comet, so three times that age is 3 * 30 = 90 years.  

  
**Step 5** Calculate Bill's age at the second sighting.  

- If Bill's dad is 105 years old during the second sighting, and Bill is 90 years old at that time, we can find the difference in years.  
- The difference in age between the two sightings is 105 - 30 = 75 years.  

  
**Step 6** Determine Bill's age at the first sighting.  

- Since Bill is 90 years old during the second sighting, we subtract the 75 years that passed since the first sighting.  
- Therefore, Bill's age at the first sighting is 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

To solve the problem, we first need to establish the total number of slices and the size of each slice for adults and kids.

### 2

Let the size of each kid's slice be represented as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the kids' slices is \( 4x \).

### 3

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. Therefore, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \). With 2 adults, the total size of the adults' slices is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

### 4

Now, we can calculate the total size of the watermelon by adding the total sizes of the kids' and adults' slices together:

\[
\text{Total size} = \text{Total size of kids' slices} + \text{Total size of adults' slices} = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

### 5

Next, we need to determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives. Since each adult's slice is \( 2x \), we can find the percentage by dividing the size of each adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\%
\]

### 6

Simplifying the fraction gives:

\[
\frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### 7

Now, converting this fraction to a percentage:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

### 8

Thus, each adult receives 25% of the watermelon.

### 9

To summarize, each adult's slice is twice the size of each kid's slice, and the total watermelon is divided into parts that account for both adults and kids.

Therefore, the final result is that each adult gets:

- It is given that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. 
- Therefore, the number of blue sticks is: 
  - \( 9 \text{ (red sticks)} + 5 = 14 \text{ (blue sticks)} \).

  
# 3. Determine the number of yellow sticks
- The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
- Thus, the number of yellow sticks is:
  - \( 14 \text{ (blue sticks)} - 3 = 11 \text{ (yellow sticks)} \).

  
# 4. Calculate the total number of sticks
- To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:
  - \( 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \text{ (total sticks)} \).

  
# 5. State the final result
- The total number of sticks they have is 34.

Brook Hills High School currently enrolls a total of 3000 students. 

  

# 2. Students over 16 years old
Half of the students are over 16 years old. Therefore, the number of students over 16 is:
\[ 
\frac{3000}{2} = 1500 
\]

  

# 3. Male students over 16 years old
One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. Thus, the number of male students over 16 is:
\[ 
\frac{1500}{4} = 375 
\]

  

# 4. Female students over 16 years old
To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16:
\[ 
1500 - 375 = 1125 
\]

  

# 5. Students under 16 years old
The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. Therefore, the number of students under 16 is also:
\[ 
\frac{3000}{2} = 1500 
\]

  

# 6. Male students under 16 years old
One-half of the students under 16 are male. Thus, the number of male students under 16 is:
\[ 
\frac{1500}{2} = 750 
\]

  

# 7. Female students under 16 years old
To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16:
\[ 
1500 - 750 = 750 
\]

  

# 8. Total female students
Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the female students over 16 and the female students under 16:

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. 

- This is our starting point for calculating the laps run by others.

### 2

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.

- Since Bethany runs 10 laps, Trey runs:  
  \( 10 + 4 = 14 \) laps.

### 3

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.

- Since Trey runs 14 laps, Shaelyn runs:  
  \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) laps.

### 4

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.

- Since Shaelyn runs 7 laps, Quinn runs:

- Maria charged her power bank for an unspecified amount of time before leaving.  
- She used it for 5 hours at a rate of 9% loss per hour.  
- After that, she used it for an additional 3 hours at a rate of 7% loss per hour.  
- Total time in use = 5 hours + 3 hours = 8 hours.  

  

**Step 2** Calculate the total percentage of charge lost during the 8 hours.  

- For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% per hour:  
  - Total loss = 5 hours * 9% = 45%.  
- For the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% per hour:  
  - Total loss = 3 hours * 7% = 21%.  
- Total charge lost = 45% + 21% = 66%.  

  

**Step 3** Determine the remaining charge after the total loss.  

- The final charge remaining after 8 hours is given as 28%.  
- If 66% was lost, then the initial charge can be calculated as:  
  - Initial charge = Remaining charge + Charge lost = 28% + 66% = 94%.  

  

**Step 4** Conclude the initial charge of the power bank.

First, we need to determine Xavier's height after his growth. 

- Xavier's initial height was 4 feet.
- We convert 4 feet to inches: \(4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}\).
- Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.

### 2

Now, we calculate Xavier's new height.

- Xavier's new height = Initial height + Growth
- Xavier's new height = \(48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}\).

Let the amount the first person took be represented as \( x \). 

### 2

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first, so we can express the second person's share as \( x + 80 \).

### 3

The third person took twice what the second person took, which can be expressed as \( 2(x + 80) \).

### 4

Now, we can set up the equation for the total amount shared among the three people:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

### 5

Simplifying the equation:

\[
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]

This combines to:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

### 6

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1920 - 240
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4x = 1680
\]

### 7

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
\]

### 8

Thus, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

### 9

To verify, we can calculate the shares of the second and third persons:

- Second person: \( 420 + 80 = 500 \)
- Third person: \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \)

# 1. Calculate the total number of days worked
- The team worked for 3 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

  
# 2. Calculate the total hours worked by the team
- Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
- The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \) days.
- To convert this to hours, we assume a full day is 8 hours, so we multiply by 8:

# 2. Set up the equation based on the total number of balls retrieved

- According to the problem, the total number of balls retrieved is 19.
- Therefore, we can write the equation:  
  \[
  (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
  \]

  

# 3. Simplify the equation

- Combine like terms in the equation:

  \]
- To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:  
  \[
  4x + 8 + x = 38

# 4. Combine and solve for \( x \)

- Combine the terms:  
  \[

Calculate the total number of tiles needed for the kitchen floor.

- The area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Each tile has an area of 1 SqFt (since each side is 1ft).
- Therefore, the total number of tiles required is:  
  \[
  \text{Total tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
  \]


### 2

Determine the cost of one tile.

- The cost of each tile is given as $12.


### 3

Calculate the total cost for all the tiles.

- The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:  
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = \text{Total tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}

Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas. Therefore, the total number of slices is:

\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

  

# 2. Determine how many slices Becky ate

It is given that Becky ate 10 slices. 

  

# 3. Relate Jake's slices to Becky's slices

Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, if we let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate, we can express this relationship as:

\[ B = J + 3 \]

Since Becky ate 10 slices:

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]

  

# 4. Solve for Jake's slices

Rearranging the equation from the previous step gives:

\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. 

  

# 5. Determine how many slices Silvia ate

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, we can express this as:

\[ S = 2J \]

Substituting Jake's slices:

\[ S = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, Silvia ate 14 slices. 

  

# 6. Calculate the total slices eaten by all three

Now we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14 \]

  

# 7. Perform the addition

Calculating the total:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

- Maggie spent a quarter of her money.
- Riza spent one-third of her money.
- Both ended up with $60 after their respective expenditures.  

  
**Step 2** Set up equations for the total amounts of money they had initially.  

- Let \( M \) be the total amount of money Maggie had.
- Since she spent a quarter, she has \( M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M \).
- This amount equals $60:  
  \[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]  

  
**Step 3** Solve for Maggie's initial amount of money.  

- Multiply both sides of the equation by 4:  
  \[ 3M = 240 \]  
- Divide by 3:  
  \[ M = 80 \]  
- So, Maggie initially had $80.  

  
**Step 4** Repeat the process for Riza.  

- Let \( R \) be the total amount of money Riza had.
- She spent one-third, so she has \( R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R \).
- This amount also equals $60:  
  \[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]  

  
**Step 5** Solve for Riza's initial amount of money.  

- Multiply both sides of the equation by 3:  
  \[ 2R = 180 \]  
- Divide by 2:  
  \[ R = 90 \]  
- So, Riza initially had $90.  

  
**Step 6** Calculate how much money each has left after spending.  

- Maggie spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \), so she has:

- We need to determine how many jellyfish are created by 5 springs in 4 hours.
- Each spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.

  

# 2. Calculate the total seconds in 4 hours
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, in 4 hours:  
  \( 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14,400 \text{ seconds} \).

  

# 3. Calculate jellyfish produced by one spring in 4 hours
- Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, in 4 hours (14,400 seconds), one spring will create:  
  \( 14,400 \text{ jellyfish} \).

  

# 4. Calculate jellyfish produced by 5 springs in 4 hours
- If one spring produces 14,400 jellyfish, then 5 springs will produce:

James's home is 4 miles from the store. Therefore, the total distance he needs to walk to reach the store is 4 miles.

  

# 2. Calculate the halfway point
Halfway to the store would be half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles. So, James walks 2 miles before realizing he forgot something.

  

# 3. Calculate the time taken to reach the halfway point
James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time taken to walk 2 miles, we use the formula:  
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]  
Thus,  
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]  

  

# 4. Calculate the return trip to home
After realizing he forgot something, James has to walk back the 2 miles to his home. The time taken for this return trip is the same as the time taken to walk to the halfway point, which is 0.5 hours.

  

# 5. Calculate the total time spent walking
Now, we add the time taken to walk to the halfway point and the time taken to walk back home:  
\[ \text{Total Time} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]  

  

# 6. Calculate the time taken to walk from home to the store
After returning home, James still needs to walk the remaining 4 miles to the store. The time taken for this trip is:

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas.

- Total bananas = Number of bunches × Average bananas per bunch  
- Total bananas = 10 bunches × 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas


### 2

Next, calculate the cost of buying these bananas individually at the supermarket.

- Cost per banana = $0.80  
- Total cost for 40 bananas = Total bananas × Cost per banana  
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas × $0.80/banana = $32.00


### 3

Now, calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

- Cost per bunch = $3.00  
- Total cost for 10 bunches = Number of bunches × Cost per bunch  
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches × $3.00/bunch = $30.00


### 4

Finally, determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

- Savings = Total cost of individual bananas - Total cost of bunches

Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card. 

  

# 2. Return of Item
Sheila returned one item that cost $15.00. This means her credit card balance will decrease by this amount. 

  

# 3. Calculate New Balance After Return
To find the new balance after the return, subtract the cost of the returned item from the initial charge:  
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.  

  

# 4. Purchase of Frying Pan
Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off the original price of $20.00.  
To calculate the discount:  
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * 20 = $4.00.  
Thus, the sale price of the frying pan is:  
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.  

  

# 5. Purchase of Towels
Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off the original price of $30.00.  
To calculate the discount:  
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * 30 = $3.00.  
Thus, the sale price of the towels is:  
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.  

  

# 6. Total New Purchases
Now, add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to find the total amount spent on these items:  
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00.  

  

# 7. Calculate Final Balance
To find the final balance on Sheila's credit card, add the total new purchases to the balance after the return:  
$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.  

  

# 8. Final Result
The new balance on Sheila's credit card after all transactions is $113.00.

1103,"**Step 1** Identify the number of large jellyfish.  

- Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be represented as \( x \).  
- According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, which can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{5} \).  

  

**Step 2** Determine the number of large jellyfish that change color.  

- It is stated that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.  
- Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).  

  

**Step 3** Set up the equation based on the information given.  

- We know that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.  
- This gives us the equation:  
  \[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]  

  

**Step 4** Solve for \( x \).  

- To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 15:  
  \[ x = 6 \times 15 \]  
- This simplifies to:  
  \[ x = 90 \]  

  

**Step 5** Verify the solution.  

- If \( x = 90 \), then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{90}{5} = 18 \).  
- The number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \), which matches the information given in the problem.  

  

**Step 6** Conclude the total number of jellyfish.  

- Since all calculations are consistent with the problem statement, we can confidently state the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

- Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
- Current salary = $100,000.
- Retirement income needed = 40% of $100,000 = $40,000 per year.


**Step 2** Determine the total amount needed for retirement.

- Lauren plans to retire for 20 years.
- Total retirement income needed = $40,000 per year × 20 years = $800,000.


**Step 3** Calculate how much Lauren saves from each paycheck.

- Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck.
- Savings from each paycheck = 20% of $100,000 = $20,000 per year.


**Step 4** Determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000.

- Total savings needed = $800,000.
- Annual savings = $20,000.
- Years needed to save = $800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years.


**Step 5** Calculate how many more years Lauren needs to work.

- If Lauren is currently working, we need to know how many years she has already worked.
- Assuming she has not worked any years yet, she needs to work 40 years.

To find out how long each final cut will be, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty will cut from the 100 centimeters of ribbon.

  

### 2

We divide the total length of the ribbon (100 centimeters) by the number of equal parts (4):

- Calculation: \( \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \)

  

### 3

Now, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long. Next, we need to divide each of these 25-centimeter parts into 5 equal parts.

**Step 2** Calculate the total production of the next two workers.  

- There are 2 workers who each produce 4 toys per hour.  
- Therefore, in one hour, they produce:

**Step 3** Calculate the total production of all four workers.  

- The total production from the first four workers is:  
  \[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]  


**Step 4** Determine the total number of toys produced and the remaining toys needed.  

- The total order is for 400 toys.  
- After the shift, they still need 20 toys to complete the order.  
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced is:

**Step 5** Calculate the production of the fifth worker.  

- The total production from all five workers over the 10-hour shift should equal 380 toys.  
- The fifth worker's production can be calculated as follows:  
  \[ \text{Total production} = \text{Production from first four workers} + \text{Production from fifth worker} \]  
  \[ 380 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} + \text{Production from fifth worker} \]

**Step 6** Calculate the production rate of the fifth worker per hour.  

- The fifth worker produced 180 toys over a 10-hour shift.  
- Therefore, the production rate per hour is:

First, we need to determine the speed of the average car, which is given as 120 miles per hour. 

  

### 2

Next, we find the speed of the second fastest car. It is stated that the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 

  

### 3

To calculate the speed of the second fastest car, we multiply the speed of the average car by 5:

\[ 
\text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} 
\]

  

### 4

Now, we need to find the speed of the fastest car. It is mentioned that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. 

  

### 5

To calculate the speed of the fastest car, we multiply the speed of the second fastest car by 1.25:

\[ 
\text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}

- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.  
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.  
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.  
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.  

**Step 2** Set up the equations based on the problem statement.  

- From the problem, we know:  
  - \( A = M \) (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)  
  - \( C + S = 30 \) (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)  
  - \( C = S + 12 \) (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)  
  - \( A + M + C + S = 56 \) (Total number of eggs painted)  

**Step 3** Substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the total equation.  

- Since \( M = A \), we can rewrite the total equation as:  
  - \( A + A + C + S = 56 \)  
  - This simplifies to \( 2A + C + S = 56 \).  

**Step 4** Substitute \( C \) in terms of \( S \) into the total equation.  

- From \( C = S + 12 \), substitute into \( 2A + C + S = 56 \):  
  - \( 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \)  
  - This simplifies to \( 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \).  

**Step 5** Solve for \( A \) and \( S \).  

- Rearranging gives:  
  - \( 2A + 2S = 44 \)  
  - Dividing by 2: \( A + S = 22 \).  

**Step 6** Use the equation \( C + S = 30 \) to find \( C \).  

- From \( A + S = 22 \), we can express \( S \) as \( S = 22 - A \).  
- Substitute \( S \) into \( C + S = 30 \):  
  - \( C + (22 - A) = 30 \)  
  - This simplifies to \( C = 30 - 22 + A = 8 + A \).  

**Step 7** Substitute \( C \) back into the equation \( C = S + 12 \).  

- We have \( C = 8 + A \) and \( C = S + 12 \).  
- Substitute \( S = 22 - A \) into \( C = S + 12 \):  
  - \( C = (22 - A) + 12 = 34 - A \).  

**Step 8** Set the two expressions for \( C \) equal to each other.  

- From \( 8 + A = 34 - A \):  
  - Rearranging gives \( 2A = 26 \)  
  - Thus, \( A = 13 \).  

**Step 9** Find \( C \) using \( A \).  

- Substitute \( A = 13 \) into \( C = 8 + A \):  
  - \( C = 8 + 13 = 21 \).  

**Step 10** Calculate how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold.  

- Since \( A = 13 \) and \( C = 21 \):

Grandma walks a total of 3 miles, which consists of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.

  

### 2
We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles. 

  

### 3
To find her walking speed on the beach, we can calculate it using the formula: 

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Substituting the values for the beach:

\[
\text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = 0.05 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

  

### 4
Since Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} = 0.1 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

  

### 5
Now, we need to calculate the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the speed formula again:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values for the sidewalk:

\[
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{0.1 \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

  

### 6
Now, we can find the total time for the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

### 4

Now, we can calculate the number of men and women:

- Number of men: 

\[
5 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 30 \text{ men}
\]

- Number of women: 

\[
9 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 54 \text{ women}
\]

### 5

Next, we need to account for the 20 women who alight from the bus. 

To find the remaining number of women, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

\[
54 - 20 = 34
\]

### 6

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight is:

\[
34

Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers at $2 each. To find the number of sunflowers sold, we divide the total earnings by the price per sunflower:  

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]  


**Step 2** Calculate the number of bouquets sold.  

Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each. To find the number of bouquets sold, we divide the total earnings by the price per bouquet:  

\[
\text{Number of bouquets} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]  


**Step 3** Calculate the total number of sunflowers in bouquets sold.  

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers from the bouquets sold is:  

\[
\text{Sunflowers from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]  


**Step 4** Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in one day.  

Now, we add the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers from bouquets:  

\[
\text{Total sunflowers in one day} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]  


**Step 5** Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days.  

To find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:  

\[
\text{Total sunflowers in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]  


**Final Result**  

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is \boxed{291}.",1,True,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints12MathFormat'}

Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a probability of:

\[ P(A) = 0.20 \]

### 2

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we calculate the probability of the second ticket winning:

\[ P(B) = 3 \times P(A) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### 3

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to calculate the joint probability of both events occurring. Assuming the outcomes of the tickets are independent, we can use the formula:

\[ P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

### 4

Substituting the probabilities we found into the formula gives us:

\[ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.20 \times 0.60 \]

### 5

Calculating this gives:

\[ P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.12 \]

### 6

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ P(A \text{ and } B) \times 100 = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

### 7

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

- Jim collected 27 seashells.  

  

**Step 2** Determine how many seashells Carlos collected.  

- Since Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, we can set up the equation:  
  \[ \text{Carlos} = \text{Jim} - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22 \]  
- Therefore, Carlos collected 22 seashells.  

  

**Step 3** Calculate how many seashells Carrey collected.  

- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so we can set up the equation:  
  \[ \text{Carlos} = 2 \times \text{Carrey} \]  
- Substituting Carlos's amount:  
  \[ 22 = 2 \times \text{Carrey} \]  
- Solving for Carrey gives:

Let:
- \( r \) = length of the red rope
- \( b \) = length of the blue rope
- \( y \) = length of the yellow rope


# 2. Establish relationships between the ropes

From the problem statement, we know:
- The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:  
  \( r = 4b \)

- The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:  
  \( b = y - 7 \)


# 3. Set up the equation for the total length

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters:  
\( r + b + y = 37 \)


# 4. Substitute the expressions for \( r \) and \( b \)

Substituting \( r \) and \( b \) into the total length equation:  
\( 4b + b + (b + 7) = 37 \)


# 5. Simplify the equation

Combine like terms:  
\( 4b + b + b + 7 = 37 \)  
This simplifies to:  
\( 6b + 7 = 37 \)


# 6. Solve for \( b \)

Subtract 7 from both sides:  
\( 6b = 30 \)  
Now divide by 6:  
\( b = 5 \)


# 7. Find the length of the red rope

Using the value of \( b \) to find \( r \):  
\( r = 4b = 4 \times 5 = 20 \)

Ronnie was given $5. 

### 2
Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. Therefore, Rissa received:
\[ 
3 \times 5 = 15 
\]

### 3
After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. 

### 4
Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). 

### 5
After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa's remaining money can be expressed as:
\[ 
15 - x 
\]
According to the problem, this is equal to \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount:
\[ 
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 
\]

### 6
Calculating \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \):
\[ 
\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 
\]

### 7
Now we can set up the equation:
\[ 
15 - x = 12 
\]

### 8
Solving for \( x \):
\[ 
x = 15 - 12 = 3 
\]

### 9
Now, Ronnie also gave \( x \) dollars to their little sister, which is $3. Therefore, Ronnie's remaining money is:
\[ 
5 - 3 = 2 
\]

### 10
Thus, the amount of money left with Ronnie is $2.

Identify the total amount of paint used in the mural.

- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

### 2

Determine the proportion of yellow paint in the mural.

- It is stated that half of the mural is yellow.
- Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

### 3

Calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors.

- Since half of the mural is yellow, the remaining half consists of red, white, and purple paint.
- The total amount of red, white, and purple paint combined is \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) pints.

### 4

Determine the distribution of the remaining paint among the three colors.

- The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Let \( x \) be the amount of each color (red, white, purple).
- Therefore, we have the equation: \( 3x = 6 \).

### 5

Solve for the amount of each color.

- Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 gives \( x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) pints.

### 6

- The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.  
- He used 45% of this chalk on Monday.  
- Calculation: \( 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \).  

  

**Step 2** Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday.  

- The remaining chalk is the initial amount minus the amount used.  
- Calculation: \( 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \).  

  

**Step 3** Determine the daily usage of chalk going forward.  

- The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day.  
- Calculation: \( 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \) used per day.  

  

**Step 4** Calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it becomes too small.  

- The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.  
- The remaining chalk is 2.75 inches, and he can use it until it reaches 2 inches.  
- The usable chalk before recycling is \( 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches} \).

- Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age.  
- Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age.  

  

**Step 2** Set up the first equation  

- According to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years.  
- In seven years, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).  
- Therefore, we can write the equation:  
  \[ W = 5(C + 7) \]  

  

**Step 3** Set up the second equation  

- The problem states that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.  
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).  
- Thus, we can write the second equation:  
  \[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]  

  

**Step 4** Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation  

- From the first equation, we have \( W = 5(C + 7) \).  
- Substitute this into the second equation:  
  \[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]  

  

**Step 5** Simplify the equation  

- Simplifying the right side gives:  
  \[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]  
- Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:  
  \[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]  
- This expands to:  
  \[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]  

  

**Step 6** Solve for \( C \)  

- Rearranging the equation gives:  
  \[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]  
- This simplifies to:  
  \[ 40 = 2C \]  
- Dividing both sides by 2 results in:  
  \[ C = 20 \]

- Jay can build 20 snowballs in 1 hour.
- This means he builds \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) snowballs per minute.

### 2

Calculate the rate at which snowballs melt.

- Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes.
- This translates to \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute.
- Therefore, he loses \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute.

### 3

Calculate the net gain of snowballs per minute.

- The net gain of snowballs per minute is:
  \[
  \text{Net gain} = \text{Rate of building} - \text{Rate of melting} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
  \]
- To perform this calculation, convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}
  \]
- Now, calculate the net gain:

- John is currently 28 years old.  

  
**Step 2** Determine the age difference between John and Jim.  

- When Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim.  
- Let Jim's age at that time be represented as \( x \).  
- Therefore, John's age at that time was \( 2x \).  

  
**Step 3** Calculate the time since Digimon's release.  

- Digimon's 20th anniversary indicates it was released 20 years ago.  
- Thus, 20 years ago, John's age was \( 28 - 20 = 8 \).  

  
**Step 4** Set up the equation based on their ages at the time of Digimon's release.  

- From Step 3, we know John was 8 years old when Digimon was released.  
- Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up the equation:  
  \[ 2x = 8 \]  

  
**Step 5** Solve for Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release.

Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. This is the total number of slices available for consumption.

  
# 2. Determine how many slices Doxa ate
Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. This is the starting point for calculating how many slices were eaten by others.

  
# 3. Calculate how many slices her sister ate
Doxa's sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa. Therefore, her sister ate:
1 (Doxa's slices) + 1 = 2 slices.

  
# 4. Calculate how many slices her brother ate
Doxa's brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. Thus, her brother ate:
2 (sister's slices) + 1 = 3 slices.

  
# 5. Sum the total slices eaten by all
Now, we can add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

1190,"**Step 1** Identify the usage and orders for each day.  

- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).  
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 28 bandages.  
- On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages).  

  

**Step 2** Calculate the total bandages used over the three days.  

- Day 1: 38 bandages used  
- Day 2: 28 bandages used  
- Day 3: 25 bandages used  
- Total used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages  

  

**Step 3** Calculate the total bandages ordered over the three days.  

- Day 1: 1 bulk pack = 50 bandages  
- Day 2: 0 bulk packs ordered  
- Day 3: 2 bulk packs = 100 bandages  
- Total ordered = 50 + 0 + 100 = 150 bandages  

  

**Step 4** Set up the equation for the initial number of bandages.  

- Let \( x \) be the initial number of bandages.  
- After Day 1: \( x - 38 + 50 \)  
- After Day 2: \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \)  
- After Day 3: \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25 \)  
- At the end of Day 3, they have 78 bandages left.  

  

**Step 5** Simplify the equation.  

- After Day 1: \( x + 12 \) (since \( 50 - 38 = 12 \))  
- After Day 2: \( x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \)  
- After Day 3: \( x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \)  
- Set this equal to the number of bandages left:  
  \( x + 59 = 78 \)  

  

**Step 6** Solve for \( x \).  

- Rearranging the equation gives:  
  \( x = 78 - 59 \)  
- Thus, \( x = 19 \).  

  

**Step 7** Verify the calculations.  

- Starting with 19 bandages:  
  - Day 1: 19 - 38 + 50 = 31 bandages left  
  - Day 2: 31 - 28 = 3 bandages left  
  - Day 3: 3 + 100 - 25 = 78 bandages left  
- The calculations confirm that the initial number of bandages is correct.

- The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
- The volume \( V \) of the jar can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:  
  \[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} \]
- The base area is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square inches.
- Therefore, the volume of the jar is:  
  \[ V = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

  

# 2. Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans

- Given that the packing efficiency is 80%, we need to find the effective volume available for the jelly beans.
- The effective volume \( V_{\text{effective}} \) is calculated as:  
  \[ V_{\text{effective}} = V \times \text{efficiency} \]
- Thus,  
  \[ V_{\text{effective}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

  

# 3. Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar

- Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
- To find the total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the effective volume, we use:  
  \[ N = \frac{V_{\text{effective}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} \]
- Therefore,  
  \[ N = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans} \]

  

# 4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans

- Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
- To find the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red, estimated}} \):  
  \[ N_{\text{red, estimated}} = N \times 0.30 \]
- Thus,  
  \[ N_{\text{red, estimated}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans} \]

  

# 5. Compare Tim's estimate to the actual number of red jelly beans

- The actual number of red jelly beans is given as 900.
- To find how far off Tim's estimate is, we calculate the difference:  
  \[ \text{Difference} = |N_{\text{red, actual}} - N_{\text{red, estimated}}| \]
- Therefore,  
  \[ \text{Difference} = |900 - 864| = 36 \]

  

# 6. Conclusion

- Tim's estimate of the number of red jelly beans was 36 jelly beans off from the actual count.

\[ 
\text{Customers needed} = 15 \text{ cars} \times 2 = 30 \text{ customers} 
\]  


**Step 2** Calculate the number of potential customers that need to come into the dealership.  

Next, we know that for every 1 customer that comes into the dealership, Jason needs to get 2 customers to come in to make a sale. Therefore, to get 30 customers into the dealership, he needs:

- Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  
- Allen requests an additional gallon, making the total 5 gallons.  

  
**Step 2** Calculate the total amount of lemon juice required.  

- Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.  
- For 5 gallons, Tim will need 5 cups of lemon juice (1 cup x 5 gallons).  

  
**Step 3** Calculate the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade.  

- Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 5 cups of juice, Tim will need:  
  - 5 cups x 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.  

  
**Step 4** Determine the lemon juice requirement for the extra tart gallon.  

- Allen wants his gallon to be twice as tart, which means it will require 2 cups of lemon juice.  

  
**Step 5** Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart gallon.  

- For 2 cups of juice, Tim will need:  
  - 2 cups x 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.  

  
**Step 6** Calculate the total number of lemons needed.  

- Combine the lemons needed for the regular lemonade and the extra tart gallon:

- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.  
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.  

  

**Step 2** Calculate the daily food consumption for German Shepherds.  

- Daily food consumption for German Shepherds = Number of German Shepherds × Food per German Shepherd  
- Daily food consumption for German Shepherds = 3 × 5 kg = 15 kg

Next, identify the number of 4-legged animals on the farm. There are 15 4-legged animals.

### 3
Calculate the total number of legs contributed by the 2-legged animals. Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs, so:

\[ 
\text{Legs from 2-legged animals} = 10 \times 2 = 20 
\]

### 4
Calculate the total number of legs contributed by the 4-legged animals. Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs, so:

\[ 
\text{Legs from 4-legged animals} = 15 \times 4 = 60 
\]

### 5
Now, add the total number of legs from both types of animals to find the overall total:

\[ 
\text{Total legs} = 20 + 60 = 80

The company produces 5000 chocolate bars in one day.

  

### 2
The company sells each bar for $2.

  

### 3
To find the total number of bars produced in two weeks, we first calculate the number of days in two weeks:  
2 weeks = 14 days.

  

### 4
Now, we calculate the total number of bars produced in 14 days:  
Total bars = 5000 bars/day × 14 days = 70000 bars.

  

### 5
Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars:  
Total revenue = Total bars × Price per bar = 70000 bars × $2/bar.

  

### 6
Now, we perform the multiplication:  
Total revenue = 70000 × 2 = $140000.

  

### 7
Thus, the total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks is $140000.

- The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.  
- There is a total of 200 feet of dock.  
- Therefore, the total line needed is calculated as:  
  \[ 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} \times 200 \text{ feet of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]  


**Step 2** Calculate how much line the caretaker currently has.  

- The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.  


**Step 3** Determine how much additional line needs to be purchased.  

- To find out how much more line is needed, subtract the amount of line he currently has from the total line needed:  
  \[ 600 \text{ feet of line needed} - 6 \text{ feet of line available} = 594 \text{ feet of line needed to buy} \]  


**Step 4** State the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total cost of $80. 

- Total cost = $80
- Number of watermelons = 50

### 2

To find the cost per watermelon, divide the total cost by the number of watermelons.

- Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
- Cost per watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

### 3

The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. 

- Profit percentage = 25%
- To find the selling price, we need to calculate the profit amount.

### 4

Calculate the profit amount on each watermelon.

- Profit amount = Cost per watermelon × Profit percentage
- Profit amount = $1.60 × 0.25 = $0.40

### 5

Now, add the profit amount to the cost per watermelon to find the selling price.

- Selling price per watermelon = Cost per watermelon + Profit amount
- Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

### 6

Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $2.00.

- Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.  


# 2. Calculate James's current age

- James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9, James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.  


# 3. Find John's age when James was born

- John had James when he was 19 years old. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  


# 4. Determine John's age when his youngest son was born

- John had his youngest son when he was 32 years old. Thus, the age difference between John's current age and the age when his youngest son was born is 37 - 32 = 5 years.  


# 5. Calculate the current age of John's youngest son

- Since John is currently 37 years old and he was 32 when his youngest son was born, the youngest son is currently 5 years old.

Mark needs a new radiator, which normally costs $400.

### 2
He finds a junk shop that offers the radiator at 80% off.

### 3
To calculate the discount, we find 80% of $400:  
\[ 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \]

### 4
Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:  
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

### 5
Mark buys the radiator for $80.

### 6
Next, he hires a mechanic to install the radiator, which takes 3 hours.

### 7
The mechanic charges $50 per hour, so we calculate the total labor cost:  
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

### 8
Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:  
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

### 9
Thus, the total amount Mark paid for the radiator and installation is $230.

1317,"To solve the problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given about the animals on Farmer Brown's farm.

### 1. Define the variables
- Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
- Let \( w \) represent the number of cows.

### 2. Set up the equations
- From the problem, we know there are a total of 20 animals:
  \[
  c + w = 20
  \]
  
- We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, leading to the total number of legs being 70:
  \[
  2c + 4w = 70
  \]

### 3. Simplify the second equation
- We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
  \[
  c + 2w = 35
  \]

### 4. Solve the system of equations
- Now we have the two equations:
  1. \( c + w = 20 \)
  2. \( c + 2w = 35 \)

- We can subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[
  (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  w = 15
  \]

### 5. Substitute back to find \( c \)
- Now that we know \( w = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation:
  \[
  c + 15 = 20
  \]
  Thus, we find:
  \[
  c = 5
  \]

### 6. Conclusion
- Therefore, the number of chickens on Farmer Brown's farm is \( c = 5 \).

The final result is \boxed{5}.",0,False,True,{'math_format_name': 'BulletPoints8MathFormat'}
