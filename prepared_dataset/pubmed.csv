"the - and -lactam 
 scaffolds are found in various 
 biologically relevant compounds . additionally , these core structures 
 are crucial intermediates in the synthesis of various natural products 
 as well as pharmaceuticals , prompting the development of new methods 
 for the synthesis of these valuable structures . 
 our group has explored the synthesis 
 of -lactams by the reactions of aryl- , thioaryl- , and cyano - substituted anhydrides . 
 furthermore , we have demonstrated that one - pot four - component reactions 
 ( 4crs ) are possible in the case of thioaryl substitution . 
 recent computational studies of the cyanosuccinic anhydride reactions 
 demonstrate that they proceed by a mannich - like mechanism via the 
 enol tautomer of the anhydride . 
 related 
 reactions reported by castagnoli , cushman , and haimova likely proceed 
 by this mechanism as well . 
 consistent with the proposed mechanism , those 
 anhydrides are poorly enolizable and require forcing conditions . 
 two 
 decades later , cushman and haimova reported analogous reactions with 
 homophthalic anhydride , which is highly enolizable . 
 the high reactivity 
 of this anhydride at lower temperatures is consistent with the mannich - like 
 mechanism . 
 these results prompted us to 
 explore mannich - type reactions and 
 related 4crs of variously substituted anhydrides . 
 although aryl - substituted 
 succinic anhydrides showed some variation in reactivity based on the 
 substituents attached to the aromatic ring , direct attachment of an 
 electron - withdrawing group resulted in higher reactivity . 
 furthermore , in the case of cyanosuccinic anhydrides , 
 the diastereoselectivity was reversed relative to the aryl and thioaryl 
 cases and could be controlled by resident stereogenic centers . 
 we envisioned that the electron - withdrawing capability of a sulfone 
 would impart the anhydride with similar reactivity as the nitrile - substituted 
 anhydride , albeit with drastically different steric requirements ( scheme 1 ) . 
 herein we report the development of anhydride 
 mannich reactions ( amrs ) using sulfone - substituted anhydrides for 
 the synthesis of - and -lactams as well as a six - step 
 formal synthesis of ( )-isoretronecanol . 
 multigram - scale syntheses of 
 anhydrides 3a  d were achieved from 
 readily available starting materials . 
 anhydride 3a was synthesized by conjugate addition of 
 benzenesulfinic acid sodium salt ( 7 ) to maleic anhydride 
 to yield a diacid , which was cyclized 
 in one step ( scheme 2a ) . 
 the syntheses of anhydrides 3b  d were achieved by michael addition 
 of sulfone acetate 8 to various tert - butyl acrylates followed by ester cleavage and cyclization ( scheme 2b ) . 
 anhydride 3a readily 
 reacted with imines to form -lactams . 
 as with previous amrs 
 , the carboxylic acid 5 ( table 1 ) is the first - formed product . unlike all previous 
 related intermediates , these carboxylic acids were prone to facile 
 decarboxylation . 
 mild heating drove the decarboxylation to completion , 
 allowing isolation of the sulfone - substituted lactams in high yields 
 with only the anti diastereomer detectable by h nmr spectroscopy . in all cases , non - enolizable substrates 
 the lack of reactivity of ketones and enolizable 
 aldehydes in the amr probably stems from the rapid equilibration to 
 the enamine tautomer , which is unreactive in the mannich addition 
 step . 
 the stereochemical 
 configuration of the products was assigned by 
 x - ray crystallography . 
 lactam 10e has an anti configuration between the aromatic ring and the sulfonyl group . 
 the other lactams were assigned by comparison of the coupling constants 
 of the adjacent protons ( e.g. , 10f ; figure 1a ) . furthermore , acid intermediate 5f , which 
 leads to 10f by decarboxylation , was also crystalline 
 and was found to have an anti configuration between 
 the sulfone and aromatic substituents ( figure 1b ) . 
 our previous mechanistic work on the cyano - substituted anhydrides 
 suggests that the anti - configured carboxylic acids 
 are the kinetic products of the amrs . 
 subsequent 
 decarboxylation leads to the anti - sulfones , which 
 would also be expected to be thermodynamically preferred . 
 x - ray structures 
 of 5f , 10f , and 10 g and j values for 10e and 10j . 
 the stereochemical outcome of 
 the reactions of imines with 3a is adequately explained 
 by a transition state that is analogous 
 to what is operative for cyanosuccinic anhydrides 
 the iminium ion is attacked by the enolate of the anhydride , 
 and the cyclic transition state is stabilized by hydrogen bonding 
 to the sulfone . 
 after the mannich reaction , subsequent rapid transannular 
 acylation forms the lactam product.1 the carboxylic acid 
 intermediates could be trapped with trimethylsilyldiazomethane 
 ( tmschn2 ) . 
 after many esterification conditions 
 were tried , treatment of crude mixtures of 5 with a commercially 
 available solution of tmschn2 resulted in reasonable yields 
 of methyl esters 11a  c ( table 2 ) . 
 these intermediates 
 could also be smoothly desulfonylated with magnesium in methanol to 
 produce the corresponding esters 12 in good yield . 
 although 
 this reaction was successful for 11a and 11b , no ester product was observed in the attempted desulfonylation 
 of 11c . 
 unlike the analogous -lactams , these intermediates were impossible 
 to isolate , thus preventing assignment of the configuration of the 
 predominant diastereomer . 
 upon decarboxylation , sulfone lactams 13 were formed as single isomers in high yields ( table 3 ) . determined by h 
 this 
 change in diastereoselectivity upon decarboxylation suggests 
 the formation of a planar anion followed by selective protonation 
 from one face of the anion . 
 this result is in accordance with experimental 
 data and models of sulfone anions proposed by corey . similar to our results with the succinic anhydride , 
 the reaction 
 tolerated a variety of non - enolizable aldehydes and a variety of alkylamines 
 and anilines . 
 while some of our initial reactions gave low yields 
 ( 4050% ) , the use of commercially available imines or those 
 purified by distillation significantly increased the yields of the 
 lactam products . 
 methyl - substituted anhydrides 3c and 3d provided trisubstituted -lactams in high 
 yields with good 
 diastereomeric ratios ( scheme 3 ) . 
 these results 
 suggest that substitution on the anhydride provides excellent facial 
 selectivity , resulting in the formation of only two diastereomers 
 of the intermediate carboxylic acids . 
 studies are ongoing 
 in our laboratory to develop an enantioselective michael addition 
 with sulfone acetate 8 to provide the anhydrides as single 
 enantiomers , which would presumably provide enantiomerically pure 
 lactam products . 
 this new amr was applied to a formal synthesis of ( )-isoretronecanol 
 ( scheme 4 ) . 
 the reaction of imine 16 with anhydride 3a followed by ring - closing metathesis 
 provides the pyrrolizidine core of the natural product from cinnamaldehyde , 
 allylamine , and 3a in two steps . the elimination of 18 yields 21 , which has been converted to ( )-isoretronecanol 
 in two steps in low yield . 
 further 
 reduction yields lactam ester 22 , which has been converted 
 to ( )-isoretronecanol in one step . while this second route is redox - inefficient , it provides material in a much higher yield and avoids 
 the high - pressure conditions necessary to reduce pyrrole 21 . 
 this synthetic route showcases the versatility of the anhydride 
 michael reaction of the sulfone - substituted anhydride , exemplifying 
 its usefulness in the assembly of heterocyclic targets . 
 this synthesis 
 demonstrates that the amr of sulfone - substituted anhydrides will be 
 useful for the assembly of many heterocyclic targets , natural and 
 otherwise . 
 in 
 summary , we have successfully synthesized various sulfone - substituted 
 - and -lactams in good yields with high diastereoselectivities 
 ( > 95:5 ) by an anhydride mannich reaction . 
 we have previously studied 
 the reactivity of several different substituted succinic anhydrides , 
 but these are the first new results employing glutaric anhydyrides 
 since the original work of castagnoli . unlike previous 
 reactions of this type to date , the carboxylic acid products were 
 prone to decarboxylation . although the -lactam acids derived 
 from the substituted succinic anhydride could be trapped as esters , 
 the analogous -lactam products could not be intercepted . 
 another 
 important difference was observed in the diastereoselectivity of the 
 initial mannich - type reaction . 
 although the reactions of succinic 
 anhydyrides were very selective , the acid products derived from the 
 glutaric anhydrides were generally formed as diastereomeric mixtures . 
 in both cases , 
 we have shown that this methodology is highly robust and 
 have showcased it in the formal synthesis of a biologically active 
 natural product .

 commercially available reagents were used as received . all reactions 
 using dried solvents

 columns of dry neutral alumina .

 high - resolution mass spectra were recorded in positive esi mode in

 were performed by flash chromatography with silica gel packed in glass 
 columns . 
 the eluting solvent for each purification was determined 
 by thin - layer chromatography ( tlc ) on glass plates coated with silica 
 gel and visualized by uv light or by staining with ceric ammonium 
 molybdate ( cam ) followed by gentle heating .

 the decline in emp levels due to dialysis is rapid with 50% of clearance being seen in the first 30 minutes . within 40 minutes , 
 the circulating emp levels were reduced to 29% of starting concentration and this level stayed relatively constant over the duration of the study . to determine the fate of the cleared emps , we measured emp levels in the dialysate . 
 the dialysate contained 5.7% of the original emp concentration ( ~65010 emp / ml ) at the end of 4 hours of uninterrupted dialysis . 
 emps levels expressed as a fraction of initial concentration by time and averaged over 3 experiments . 
 the data presented here demonstrate that counter - current dialysis using a standard clinical cvvh filter and under clinical conditions removes emps from a modelled patient 's circulation . 
 given our previous evidence of emp - induced ali , these findings support the idea of cvvh as a meaningful therapeutic intervention in ali due to clearance of emps from the patient circulation . 
 the experimental conditions achieve the same plasma level of emps as seen in human clinical disease ( 110 per ml ) . 
 while this work demonstrates that a standard 200-m cvvh circuit and filter entraps emps , there are significant limitations to the model presented . 
 the observed emp clearance is likely a saturable phenomenon , which would explain the relatively constant emp concentration from 40 to 70 minutes and low dialysate emp levels . 
 the relative volume of human circulation ( ~5 l ) to cvvh circuit ( ~200 ml ) is much higher in the clinical condition as compared to our model ( 300 and 170 ml , respectively ) . while this would not affect a steady state of dialysis , a saturable filter emp - binding 
 additionally , emps may continue to be generated in a patient and a non - saturable clearance method would be required to achieve a lower steady state emp concentration . 
 convection and pressure gradient forces were not modelled , as these interventions require replacement fluid and this would confound emp measurement . 
 however , if emp charge and size are amenable , forced hindered diffusion via the application of convective and pressure forces coupled with replacement by emp - free fluid would likely sustain clearance . in conjunction with particle trapping by the filter 
 , the first order kinetics of emp clearance could be prolonged at a minimum . additionally , emp interactions in vivo with plasma oncotic elements ( circulating cells , albumin , etc . ) 
 we do not feel that such elements have a major impact upon the steady state of emps in vivo , since characterized emps in human disease states using flow cytometry have identified the 0.510 per ml threshold injury value using flow cytometry of submicron events occurring in platelet - free plasma ( 54 ) . 
 thus , the absence of these elements in our model is representative of the steady state of unbound plasma emps present in human disease . 
 the low dialysate emp level and plateauing circulation emp level beyond 40 minutes suggest that emp sequestration occurs within the cvvh filter or tubing and that this is a saturable phenomenon . 
 frequent changing of the cvvh filter is a logical step that may overcome this limitation . 
 additionally , more efficient and selective emps clearance can be realized by conjugating endothelium - specific antibodies to commercially available specialty cvvh filters ( aethlon adapt ) . 
 this approach would provide more selective binding sites and higher affinity for circulating emps . by combining a selective filter with convection and pressure gradients , emp clearance could likely be substantially prolonged . 
 clinical data generally support the protective role of cvvh in ali management . a clinical randomized trial and several animal trials 
 demonstrate that the achievement of negative fluid balance is associated with improved outcomes from ali ( 6265)(67,68 ) . 
 in addition to its salutary effects on emp levels , early cvvh may prevent or minimize volume overload that is commonly observed with the resuscitation phase of critical illness , particularly in persons suffering concomitant acute kidney injury ( aki ) . 
 thus , cvvh could be used as an effective tool targeting both the molecular machinery and iatrogenic components of ali . as a translatable 
 next step , we plan to assay patients pre- and post - dialysis to observe emp concentration effects . 
 ultimately , the application of dialysis to rodent models of emp - induced ali would examine efficacy in on - going diseases and emp thresholds associated with worse injuries . 
 while the utility of ultrafiltration can be tested in an animal model , diffusion appears to be enough to remove emps due to their small size : standard dialysis alone was effective in this in vitro model .

 we have previously demonstrated emp - induced acute lung injury ( ali ) in animal models and endothelial barrier dysfunction in vitro . 
 current treatment options for ali are limited and consist of supportive therapies . 
 we hypothesize that standard clinical continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( cvvh ) reduces serum emp levels and may be adapted as a potential therapeutic intervention.materials and methodsemps were generated from plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 ( pai-1)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) . 
 flow cytometric analysis was used to characterize emps as cd31- and annexin v - positive events in a submicron size gate . 
 enumeration was completed against a known concentration of latex beads . 
 ultimately , a concentration of ~650,000 emp / ml perfusate fluid ( total 470 ml ) was circulated through a standard cvvh filter ( pore size 200 m , flow rate 250 ml / hr ) for a period of 70 minutes . 
 0.5 ml aliquots were removed at 5- to 10-minute intervals for flow cytometric analysis . 
 emp concentration in the dialysate was measured at the end of 4 hours to better understand the fate of emps.resultsa progressive decrease in circulating emp concentration was noted using standard cvvh at 250 ml / hr ( a clinical standard rate ) from a 470 ml volume modelling a patient 's circulation . 
 a 50% reduction was noted within the first 30 minutes . 
 emps entering the dialysate after 4 hours were 5.7% of the emp original concentration.conclusionthese data demonstrate that standard cvvh can remove emps from circulation in a circuit modelling a patient . 
 an animal model of hemofiltration with induction of emp release is required to test the therapeutic potential of this finding and potential of application in early treatment of ali .",pubmed
"patients with frequent angina ( 1 episode per week ) report greater physical limitations and decreased quality of life compared with patients with minimal angina.1 the goals of chronic stable angina management are not only to control symptoms , but also to reduce the risk of adverse clinical outcomes.26 as symptom control impacts the patient s quality of life , maximum consideration should be given to the array of available management options that aim to reduce angina symptoms . for many patients 
 , this would include a physical activity program aimed at improving exercise tolerance in accordance with current secondary prevention guidelines . 
 several studies have shown that optimal medical therapy , along with aggressive risk factor modification , is as effective as revascularization in reducing the risk of adverse coronary events.79 optimal medical therapy includes anti - anginal or anti - ischemic as well as disease- modifying therapy.8,10 the anti - ischemic agents include short- and long - acting nitrates , beta - blockers , and calcium channel blockers.3,4,11 these agents reduce angina symptoms and prolong exercise duration and/ or time to st - segment depression.3,11 frequently , a combination of drugs is necessary for optimal symptom control.3 nitrates work primarily by venodilation and afford rapid relief of angina.12 a number of placebo - controlled studies have shown that the sublingual application of nitroglycerin increases exercise duration in patients with stable angina.1317 published data also suggest that residual and recurrent angina is frequently experienced by patients who have already undergone either a percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedure , and these patients require continued medical therapy with multiple anti - anginal agents , including short- and long - acting nitrates , for control of their symptoms.8,18,19 increased physical exercise is also important in patients with stable angina to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events , and current recommendations call for the use of sublingual nitroglycerin as part of optimal medical therapy.5,20 this randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover , dose - ranging multicenter study in patients with chronic stable angina evaluated the effect of a sublingual nitroglycerin spray formulation on time to onset of angina during exercise , total exercise duration , and time to exercise - induced myocardial ischemia , as evidenced by electrocardiographic st - segment depression .

 lifestyle modifications , including supervised exercise therapy , play an important role in the success of optimal medical therapy.2427 however , patients with stable angina generally have impaired exercise tolerance and reduced daily physical activity.28 sublingual nitroglycerin increases physical exercise tolerance which , in turn , helps to increase the amount of exertion possible prior to the onset of angina.12,13 sublingual forms of nitroglycerin are readily absorbed through mucous membranes , and their effect is prompt , reliable , and more effective than other forms of nitroglycerin , including ointments , transdermal patches , and sustained - release preparations.11,29 the results of this study are in line with prior findings and demonstrate a significant improvement in exercise tolerance with sublingual nitroglycerin spray in patients with stable angina . 
 although sublingual nitroglycerin spray was generally well tolerated , an increase of treatment - related adverse events was observed with higher dose levels ( 26% of patients with 1.6 mg nitroglycerin spray ) . 
 one important issue that is not specifically addressed in this study is the clinical relevance of the nearly 1-minute improvement in exercise duration with sublingual nitroglycerin spray over placebo . 
 it must be recognized that this improvement was experienced by patients who were exercising at a higher work load ( higher speed and incline during the treadmill test ) after receiving the study medication . 
 as most real - world patients have a much slower walking pace , this finding indicates that prophylactic nitroglycerin spray might allow much greater increases in walking times during normal daily activities . 
 although this outcome was not formally evaluated in the present study or discussed in previous publications to our knowledge , patients have often reported a marked increase in angina - free walking time and exercise duration after taking prophylactic sublingual nitroglycerin . 
 since this study of sublingual nitroglycerin spray was conducted , there have been significant changes in optimal medical therapy for stable coronary artery disease . 
 this is particularly apparent in the greater use of beta - blockers compared with calcium channel blockers and long - acting nitrates to treat angina , and the routine use of daily aspirin and a statin to reduce serious cardiovascular outcomes.3,8 although beta - blockers are currently considered a standard treatment for stable angina , patients receiving these medications may continue to experience angina.30 however , patients with a history of beta - blocker use who are appropriately supplemented with sublingual nitroglycerin or long - acting nitrates show significant improvements in angina - free exercise duration and total walking time compared with placebo.3,5,29 the american college of cardiology and american heart association guidelines for the management of patients with chronic stable angina emphasize the initial use of medical therapy.5,20,31 these guidelines include the recommendation for all patients to undergo a risk assessment with a physical activity history and/or an exercise test to guide prognosis and prescription . 
 ett is associated with a very low rate of serious adverse events such as death ( 0.5 per 10,000 tests ) , myocardial infarction ( 3.58 per 10,000 tests ) , or serious arrhythmias ( 4.78 per 10,000 tests).15 guideline - compliant medical therapy improves clinical outcome in many patients with stable angina , as evidenced by an observational study in which increasingly guideline - compliant therapy was associated with a reduction in death and myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina during 1 year of follow - up.32 indeed , implementation of a quality improvement program in utah to enhance the prescription of appropriate discharge medications among patients with cardiovascular disease was associated with improvements in cardiovascular readmission rates and reductions in mortality.33 a number of studies have compared the effect of optimal medical therapy versus revascularization on symptoms and outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina . in general , these studies have shown that optimal medical therapy is effective in controlling symptoms and , along with risk factor modification , can reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events.8,34 moreover , these studies have shown that there is no significant difference in serious adverse clinical events , such as myocardial infarction and death , between patients who have received medical therapy and those who have undergone revascularization.2,5,8 the clinical outcomes utilizing revascularization and aggressive drug evaluation ( courage ) trial , which compared the efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) plus optimal medical therapy versus optimal medical therapy alone , demonstrated similar rates of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction in both patient groups over a follow - up period of 55 months.8 moreover , both groups demonstrated a substantial reduction in angina symptoms , with 74% and 72% of patients in the pci and optimal medical therapy groups , respectively , angina - free after 5 years of follow - up.8 further analysis of data from the courage study found that both groups of patients had marked improvements in health status , including reductions in angina symptoms , and improved quality of life . 
 although the pci group demonstrated significantly greater health benefits in the short term , these benefits disappeared after longer - term follow - up , and by 36 months there was no significant difference in health status between the 2 groups.9 the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation 2 diabetes trial in patients with diabetes , coronary artery disease , and classic angina compared the effects of revascularization with medical therapy alone on clinical outcomes . during the 5-year follow - up 
 , no difference was found between the medical therapy and revascularization groups on the risk of all - cause death , myocardial infarction , or stroke.34 furthermore , a meta - analysis of 11 randomized trials comparing pci with conservative treatment in patients with stable coronary artery disease found no significant difference between the 2 treatment strategies with regard to overall mortality , cardiac death , or myocardial infarction.7 current recommendations state that patients with stable angina may defer surgical intervention without additional risk to allow for determination of response to optimal medical therapy.5,11 despite the published outcome data and current guideline recommendations , many patients are still referred for revascularization , mainly due to a belief that these procedures reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or death more effectively than optimal medical therapy alone.2,3,8,35 additional studies assessing the long - term benefits of exercise in the context of medical therapy compared with revascularization outcomes could help to further inform the clinical decision making process . 
 in this study , sublingual nitroglycerin spray was shown to increase time to onset of moderate angina during exercise . 
 this improvement in physical exercise tolerance may be of great clinical relevance , as the prophylactic use of sublingual nitroglycerin spray allows patients to face exertion with confidence and permits exercise for a longer amount of time . 
 these results support the use of sublingual nitroglycerin spray as nitrate therapy in patients with stable angina who are being managed with optimal medical therapy . 
 this approach may also be beneficial for patients who have persistent angina post - revascularization . 
 further studies are needed to evaluate the long - term beneficial effects of using routine prophylactic nitroglycerin spray in patients with stable angina to increase exercise duration and improve quality of life and well - being .","backgroundsublingual nitroglycerin increases exercise duration in patients with stable angina .

"the residual and resistant microorganisms have been recognized as the basic reason for failures in root canal treatments . 
 fungi , chemoorganotrophic eukaryotic microorganisms , may play a key part in periradicular diseases . while they have been found sporadically in initial root canal infections , 
 failure of some endodontic treatments may therefore be explained by the presence of candida albicans in the oral flora . 
 it is reported that in 20% of endodontic treatment failures , c. albicans is present . 
 candida species , which have a tendency to invade dentin , are regarded as dentinophilic microorganisms . 
 the presence of c. albicans in endodontic treatment failures may be the result of coronal leakage after , or contamination during , the endodontic treatment . 
 several factors , such as an ability to survive despite a lack of nutrients or resistance to intracanalicular treatment materials , may result in c. albicans remaining in the root canal system . c. albicans has been found in some failed endodontic treatments ; a phenomenon that might be explained by the invasive nature of this fungus or its resistance to some intracanalicular medications , e.g. , calcium hydroxide . 
 if repeated treatment has either failed or is unfeasible , the only alternative is a root - end resection . 
 apical sealing , avoiding contamination , and reducing the number of microorganisms , including bacteria and fungi , influence the success rate of such treatment . therefore , the antibacterial and antifungal properties of root - end filling materials are important to the outcome of these procedures . 
 mineral trioxide aggregate ( mta ) was introduced in 1993 and , after different examinations , approved , in 1998 , by the us food and drug administration as an endodontic biomaterial , used in root - end filling , vital pulp capping , apexification , and root or furcal perforation repair.[58 ] mta is marketed as gray and white . however , because of the tooth - discoloring properties of gray mta , white mta has been pushed to replace it . 
 mta has a number of advantages , including excellent sealing ability , biocompatibility , high alkalinity , radiopacity , antimicrobial effects , and resistance to fluid and blood contamination.[911 ] in spite of having disadvantages , such as delayed setting time , poor handling properties , and high price , mta , because of its physical and chemical properties , has become the gold standard of root - end filling materials . 
 mta - angelus particles are not as homogenous as proroot mta . in comparison to proroot mta , 
 mta - angelus shows several advantages , such as good marginal adaptation , good sealing , sealing ability in mineralized tissues with complete closure , and has been reported to be inflammation - free in most cases.[1517 ] mta - angelus has an excellent antibacterial effect and a strong fungicidal effect against c. albicans . 
 while both the white and gray mta - angelus have arsenic in their structures , white mta - angelus has the benefit of containing arsenic levels below the limit set by the iso 9917 - 1 standard . 
 a limited number of researches have compared the antifungal effects of proroot mta and mta - angelus . 
 however , such studies have been conducted using agar diffusion test ( adt ) , a method that does not seem appropriate because of low solubility and diffusibility of mta . 
 the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of fresh and set proroot mta and mta - angelus , in concentrations of 50 mg / ml and 100 mg / ml , against c. albicans at 1- , 24- , and 48-hour time points . 
 the null hypothesis of this study was that there is no difference in the in vitro antifungal properties of these two materials . 
 the antifungal activity of proroot mta ( dentsply tulsa dental , tulsa , usa ) as well as mta - angelus ( angelus , londrina , brazil ) was evaluated against c. albicans . 
 the culture of sabouraud dextrose agar ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) was prepared according to the manufacturer 's instructions with a definite ratio of powder to liquid . 
 samples of live c. albicans , ( atcc 10231 ) provided by scientific research organization , ( tehran , iran ) were subcultured on the sabouraud dextrose agar plates . the agar plates , containing the fungus , were then maintained at 37c . 
 times and conditions for the culture of c. albicans in this study were determined following the nccls standards ( national committee on clinical laboratory standards ) . 
 a total of 50 culture wells were divided into four experimental groups ( freshly mixed mta , freshly mixed mta - angelus , 24-h set mta , 24-h set mta - angelus ) and two control groups ( positive control , negative control ) . 
 the root canal filling materials were prepared according to their instructions and then mixed with the appropriate volume of sterile water to reach the concentrations of 50mg / ml or 100mg / ml . for the set groups , the mixture was prepared and left for 24 hours . 
 each group consisted of 10 wells , and the control groups consisted of five wells each . 
 suspensions were then made by the addition of several fungal colonies from the surface of the sabouraud dextrose agar plates to sabouraud dextrose broth media . 
 a final concentration of 10 cfu / ml ( colony forming unit / milliliter ) was achieved , as recommended by the nccls , via microscopic cell counting . 
 wells with 1 ml of c. albicans suspension mixed and 1 ml of sabouraud dextrose broth media without root end - filling materials served as positive control and wells with 1 ml of sabouraud dextrose broth media without c. albicans served as negative control . 
 all wells were incubated at 37c and evaluated for 1 , 24 , and 48 hours by an independent observer by assessing the colonies of c. albicans in each well . 
 this assessment was based on the turbidity of the suspension in the tubes . at each time point , 0.02 ml of each suspension was cultured on sabouraud dextrose agar plate to confirm c. albicans growth . 
 after the culture of 0.02ml of the treated suspension on the agar plates , the fungal growth was assessed at 1- , 24- , and 48-hour time points . while fungal growth was not observed in any of the negative control groups , 
 after 1 hour , both the mta and mta - angelus were incapable of killing c. albicans . 
 the results were the same for both freshly mixed and set samples at both concentrations ( 50 and 100 mg / ml ) . increasing the incubation time to 24 hours and 
 both materials were fungicidal for c. albicans at both concentrations of 50 and 100 mg / ml , and in both states of fresh and set [ table 1 ] . 
 comparison of proroot mta and mta - angelus in concentration of 50 mg / ml and 100 mg / ml at 1 , 24 , and 48-h time intervals there was no significant difference between using the two materials at either of the concentrations or either of the 1-hour , 24-hour , or 48-hour time points ( p<0.05 ) . 
 in this study , the antifungal properties of proroot mta and mta - angelus against c. albicans in two concentrations and in fresh and set situations were compared by using tube - dilution test . because the two materials elicited the same reaction against c. albicans in different conditions , the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the in vitro properties of these two materials has to be accepted . the most common method for assessing the antifungal or antibacterial activity of root - end filling materials 
 however , several parameters , such as lack of standardization of inoculum density , adequate culture medium , agar viscosity , plate storage condition , size and number of specimens per plate , time and temperature of incubation , and reading point of the inhibition zones , can affect the results of the adt . 
 the method used in this in vitro study was the tube - dilution susceptibility test ; an efficient method for evaluating antifungal characteristics of materials . in this technique , direct contact between c. albicans and the experimental materials was allowed , allowing a more realistic interaction . 
 because of possible changes in the chemical structure of the products , root - end filling materials should be tested in two situations ; one where the material is used immediately after mixing , and another , where it is used after having been allowed to reach its final chemical composition , or set state . in this study 
 , proroot mta and mta - angelus were tested in freshly mixed and set states , to mimic clinical use of the materials . after setting , 
 consequently , the perceived difference in antifungal patterns of the materials may be a result of the differences in the degree of setting . 
 however , in our study , the results were similar in the two different states for all tested materials . based on nccls standards , 
 the results of this study showed that c. albicans was not affected by the freshly mixed and set , proroot mta and mta - angelus , at 1 hour . 
 however , these materials were effective in eliminating c. albicans by the 24-h time point . 
 some studies have reported the inhibitory effect of proroot mta and mta - angelus on c. albicans by determining the diameter of the inhibition zones in millimeters , and have resulted conclusions similar to this study . 
 the presence of calcium hydroxide , produced by a hydration reaction from the mixing of mta with water , and an increase in ph , as a result of the release of hydroxyl ions , is probably the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of mta - angelus . 
 they suggested that the presence of calcium hydroxide is capable of , initially , reducing and , ultimately , eliminating the fungus . 
 it is important to mention that the results presented in this study were obtained under in vitro conditions , and may not accurately describe in vivo activity . 
 further studies are necessary to investigate the effect of these materials on bacteria and fungi in clinical application . 
 this study shows that mta - angelus has an effective antifungal property comparable to proroot mta at concentrations of 50 and 100 mg / ml .","background : fungi may play a key part in periradicular diseases . the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antifungal properties of two root - end filling materials , proroot mineral trioxide aggregate ( mta ) and mta - angelus , against candida albicans using tube - dilution test.materials and methods : the antifungal properties of proroot mta and mta - angelus against c. albicans was assessed at 1 , 24 , and 48 hours following administration of two concentrations of the antifungal agents ( 50 and 100 mg / ml ) . 
 a total of 50 culture wells were divided into four experimental groups ( freshly mixed mta , freshly mixed mta - angelus , 24-h set mta , and 24-h set 
 mta - angelus ) and two control groups . 
 each well was prepared for one specific agent with a specific concentration . 
 for the set groups , the mixture was prepared and left for 24 hours . 
 one milliliter of suspension of fungal colonies with concentration of 104 cfu / ml was then added to the mixtures in each well . 
 all wells were incubated at 37c and assessed at 1 , 24 , and 48 hours . 
 this observation was based on the turbidity of the suspension in the tubes . at each time point , 0.02 ml of each suspension was cultured on a sabouraud dextrose agar plate to confirm c. albicans growth . 
 the results were analyzed using kruskal - wallis test.results:although all fresh and set samples were incapable of killing c. albicans at 1 hour , they demonstrated fungicidal ability on agar plates at 24 and 48-hour time points.conclusion:mta-angelus proved to be an effective antifungal agent compared to proroot mta at concentrations of 50 mg / ml and 100 mg / ml .",pubmed
"deficits of motor and sensory functions after stroke on the side contralateral to the 
 damaged hemisphere are often evident1 , 
 whereas the ipsilateral side may be primarily regarded as normal or unaffected . however , 
 there is increasing evidence of the presence of subtle motor deficits in motor performance 
 on the ipsilateral side as well2 , 3 . 
 ipsilateral motor deficits emerge during 
 the acute phase and demonstrate chronic persistence3,4,5 ; the reasons for ipsilateral motor deficits are still unclear . 
 clinical assessment tools may not be sufficient for differentiating ipsilateral motor 
 deficits ; however , deficits in dexterous motor and coordination function on the ipsilateral 
 side have been identified in laboratory testing2 , 
 6,7,8 . 
 however , kinematic deficits in the ipsilateral upper limb in performance of various specific 
 motor tasks requiring dexterity and coordination , such as a tracking task , a goal - direction 
 movement , and a tapping task , have been found in recent studies2 , 6 , 8 , 11 . on the basis of these 
 observations , several possible mechanisms for ipsilateral motor deficits 
 have been 
 suggested , such as disrupted counterbalance of each hemisphere , dysfunction of the uncrossed 
 corticospinal track , or the different roles of both sides in hemispheric functions6 , 7 , 11,12,13,14,15 . 
 as mentioned above , patients with brain damage suffer from ipsilateral motor deficits in 
 performance of the ipsilateral upper limb . 
 until now , most studies of ipsilateral deficits 
 in stroke patients have concentrated on the motor , rather than sensory deficits . 
 therefore , the purpose of 
 the current study was to investigate the presence of motor and sensory deficits in the 
 ipsilateral upper limb , and to examine the correlation between the two variables in patients 
 with stroke using a tracking and reposition sense test . 
 fifty hemiparetic stroke patients ( 25 patients with right brain injury and 25 patients with 
 left brain injury ) referred to a local rehabilitation hospital were consecutively recruited 
 in the order of their registration . 
 the inclusion criteria were ; first ever stroke confirmed 
 by medical history and brain mri ; right handed individual verified by the edinburg 
 handedness inventory ; no symptoms of unilateral neglect or hemianopsia ; no cognitive problem 
 ( mini - mental state examination>24 points ) ; no apraxic behavior ( ideomotor apraxia score 
 developed by ambosoni et al . 
 ( > 11 points)16 ; and no musculoskeletal dysfunction in the unaffected upper limb . 
 we recruited 40 sex- and age - matched normal control subjects . to control the known effects 
 of hand asymmetry , the accuracy and proprioceptive tests were performed by the 20 control 
 subjects using their dominant right hand , and the remaining subjects used their non - dominant 
 left hand . 
 all subjects gave their written informed consent prior to participation , and this 
 study was approved by the local ethics committee . 
 tracking and joint position sense tests were conducted for the hand ipsilateral to the 
 damaged hemisphere of the patients , and with the corresponding hand of the same side of the 
 control subjects . 
 all subjects were seated in front of a table , with the forearm comfortably 
 supported and the elbow flexed at 90. a plastic frame with an embedded potentiometer was 
 used to measure the accuracy of movement and proprioceptive sense in the metacarpophalangeal 
 ( mp ) joints . 
 the potentiometer detected flexion / extension motion of the mp joint , and 
 transmitted the analog signal to a computer with analog - to - digital data acquisition 
 software , that sampled the signal at a frequency of 200  hz . in the tracking task , the subject was instructed to track the red target sine wave 
 displayed for 15 seconds on the computer screen as accurately as possible . 
 the response sine 
 wave made by the subject was displayed as a black solid line , which tracked up as the mp 
 joint was extended , and tracked down as the mp joint was flexed . 
 accuracy of the motor performance was 
 analyzed by an accuracy index ( ai ) , which was normalized to the range of motion of the mp 
 joint of each individual subject , and takes into account the differences between subjects in 
 the excursion of the target and response waves17.ai = 100(p  e)/p where e is the root mean square ( rms ) error between the target line and the response line , 
 and p is the size of the subject s target pattern , calculated as the rms difference between 
 the sine wave and the midline dividing the upper and lower phases of the sine wave . 
 the 
 degree of p is determined by the scale of the vertical axis of the range of subject s mp 
 joint motion . 
 prior to the evaluation , three practice trials were provided after one demonstration , using 
 sine waves which were different from the sine waves used in the actual test to prevent a 
 learning effect . 
 the joint position sense was evaluated on the mp joint ipsilateral to the 
 damaged brain hemisphere of the patients , and the joint on the corresponding side of the 
 control subjects . 
 in addition , the same experimental apparatus and environment used for the 
 performance of the tracking task were used . 
 the subjects were instructed to actively 
 reproduce the position of the mp joint which was passively positioned by the examiner . 
 three 
 different passively - positioned angles were randomly presented , in terms of 50% , 70% , and 90% 
 flexion of the total range of motion of the mp joint . 
 the mean value of three trials of the 
 joint reposition errors between the passively - positioned angles and the actively - positioned 
 angles was calculated . 
 the  test was performed to analyze the differences in sex distribution between 
 the patient and control groups . 
 the independent t - test was performed to determine the 
 significance of differences in age and accuracy of the tracking task / joint position sense . 
 in addition , correlation between the ai and joint position sense was investigated using 
 pearson s correlation coefficient . 
 chicago , il , usa ) was used for the 
 statistical analysis of all data , and statistical significance was accepted for p values 
 < 0.05 . 
 no significant differences were observed between the two 
 groups in terms of distribution of sex and age . 
 the meanssd of the accuracy index and 
 reposition error score of both groups are shown in table 2 . in terms of motor function , 
 the stroke group showed a lower accuracy 
 index in the mp joint than the control group . 
 a higher score of reposition errors in the 
 joint reposition test in relation to sensory function was observed in the stroke group , 
 compared to the control group . 
 the results of the statistical analysis indicate that both 
 measures in the stroke group were significantly different from the control group 
 ( p<0.05 ) . 
 ipsilateral sensory deficits showed significant correlation with motor deficits 
 ( r= 0.549 ) ( p<0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 in the current study , we attempted to assess motor function using a tracking task for 
 visuomotor coordination , and proprioceptive sense using a joint reposition test for the 
 ipsilateral upper limb . 
 our findings reveal a lower accuracy index in the tracking task , and 
 higher error scores in the joint reposition test in the stroke group , compared to sex- and 
 age - matched normal subjects . 
 in addition , there was a negative correlation between the motor 
 and sensory deficits , indicating stroke patients would have difficulty in performing 
 complicated motor tasks requiring delicate sensoriomotor functions using pure integrity of 
 movement accuracy and proprioceptive sense . 
 our present results are in accordance with those of several previous studies2 , 8 , 
 suggesting the presence of motor deficits in upper limbs ipsilateral to the damaged 
 hemisphere in the visuomotor tracking task . 
 a possible mechanism for the motor dysfunction 
 in the ipsilateral hemisphere of stroke patients has been suggested by previous studies , 
 which reported bilateral hemisphere activation when normal subjects executed a unilateral 
 upper limb task18,19,20,21 . 
 if functional integrity of both the right and left brain cortex is 
 necessary for normal motor control of the upper limb , it is expected that the ipsilateral 
 upper limb would be affected after stroke . in the present study , 
 ipsilateral sensory 
 deficits related to proprioceptive sense were also observed . according to our findings 
 , 
 ipsilateral sensory deficits may be connected with bilateral hemisphere activation during 
 performance of motor tasks . 
 the primary sensory cortex ( s1 ) conveys efferent projection to 
 the posterior parietal cortex ( brodmann s area 5 and 7 ) , which is connected bilaterally 
 through the corpus callsosum . 
 therefore , as suggested by our results , it is possible that 
 disturbance of transcallosal transfer after unilateral brain damage may lead to ipsilateral 
 sensory deficits . 
 in addition , there is a close relationship between sensory and motor 
 function , because the posterior parietal cortex is connected with the frontal motor areas . 
 thus , the posterior parietal cortex would have an effect on the initial movement and sensory 
 feedback during performance of a complex motor task22 . on this basis , 
 the correlation shown in our study between 
 ipsilateral motor deficits and sensory deficits can be explained . 
 these findings imply that interest in the ipsilateral side of stroke patients should focus 
 on ipsilateral sensory deficits as well as ipsilateral motor deficits . 
 motor deficits of the 
 ipsilateral limbs of individuals with stroke have been reported in many studies ; besides , 
 our study showed sensory deficits related to proprioceptive sense . on the basis of these 
 results 
 , we think that the difficultly stroke patients experience in task performance using 
 the ipsilateral upper limb may be affected by both motor and sensory deficits . 
 studies on 
 recovery of motor deficits on the ipsilateral side after stroke are in progress . 
 jung et 
 al.14 reported that motor deficits in 
 the ipsilateral upper limb show maximal recovery within one month after onset of stroke , but 
 the deficits do not completely recover . 
 thus , it will be necessary to study the recovery of 
 ipsilateral sensory deficits after stroke onset , and we will be investigating this . 
 we 
 acknowledge that our study had some limitations , in that the effects of specific lesion 
 location and the extent of the damage were not identified . 
 therefore , future studies will be 
 required in order to determine more detailed mechanisms of other movement and sensory 
 deficits , other than proprioceptive sense , in the ipsilateral upper limb of patients with 
 unilateral brain injury .","[ purpose ] previous studies have reported on motor deficits in the ipsilateral upper 
 limbs ( ul ) of a damaged brain hemisphere in motor tasks . however , little is known about 
 sensory deficits on the ipsilateral side . 
 therefore , we investigated whether both motor 
 and sensory function of the ipsilateral ul are affected in patients with stroke . 
 [ subjects 
 and methods ] fifty patients with unilateral stroke and 40 age- and sex- matched normal 
 subjects participated in this study . 
 subjects were evaluated on performance of a tracking 
 task for motor function , and by the joint reposition test for integrity of proprioceptive 
 sense in the ipsilateral ul . [ result ] the comparison of the stroke group and the control 
 group showed significant differences in performance of the tracking task and the joint 
 reposition test . 
 the accuracy index for the tracking task showed significant correlation 
 with the error score for the joint reposition test in the stroke group . 
 [ conclusion ] these 
 results suggest that the ipsilateral ul of stroke patients has impairment in sensory 
 function which is related to proprioceptive sense , along with motor deficits . 
 therefore , 
 we think that the difficulty stroke patients experience with motor tasks for the 
 ipsilateral ul is induced by diminished integrity of sensorimotor function due to both 
 sensory and motor deficits .",pubmed
"the millennium cohort is the largest prospective study using primary data collection ever undertaken by the department of defense ( dod ) . 
 the study began in 2001 with the objective to collect and evaluate data on health , behavioral risk factors , and occupational characteristics related to military service that may be associated with adverse health outcomes ( 14 ) . 
 this report includes participants from the first enrollment cycle that spanned 20012003 and comprised 77,047 participants ( 36% of those able to be contacted ) . 
 approximately 71% of those participants enrolled at baseline responded to follow - up surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 . 
 the surveys were administered via paper and the internet and included questions on self - reported provider - diagnosed medical conditions , mental health symptoms , physical and functional status , alcohol and tobacco use , occupational status , military exposures , sleep patterns , and demographic information . 
 this study was approved by the naval health research center institutional review board , and informed consent was obtained from all study participants . 
 this research has been conducted in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects in research ( protocol nhrc.2000.0007 ) . 
 of the 77,047 participants enrolled at baseline , follow - up surveys were completed by 55,021 participants at year 3 and 54,790 at year 6 . since incident diabetes was the outcome of interest , eligible participants included those who were followed until either the outcome was reported to have occurred at year 3 or 6 , or until their last completed follow - up if the outcome was not reported . 
 exclusions included participants reporting provider - diagnosed diabetes at baseline , missing outcome or exposure data , or if dod outpatient or inpatient medical encounter data contained codes for type 1 diabetes ( n = 72 ) ( icd-9 codes 250.x1 and 250.x3 ) . 
 the primary data sources were the self - administered millennium cohort surveys and dod electronic personnel files , managed by the defense manpower data center ( dmdc , seaside , ca ) . 
 for these analyses , electronic records from dmdc provided information on age , sex , race / ethnicity , education , pay grade , service branch , service component , military occupation , dates of separation , and deployment dates . 
 dmdc information was supplemented with self - reported data to reduce missing values when necessary . 
 three sleep variables were included in the analyses : 1 ) trouble sleeping , 2 ) sleep duration , and 3 ) sleep apnea . 
 trouble sleeping was assessed using the sleep items on the prime - md patient health questionnaire ( phq ) and the ptsd checklist  civilian version ( pcl - c ) ( 1720 ) . 
 the phq asks ,  over the last 4 weeks , how often have you experienced trouble falling asleep or staying asleep ?  the pcl - c asks ,  in the past month , have you had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep ?  participants with trouble sleeping were defined as those who responded 
 moderately  or above on the pcl - c sleep item or  several days  or longer on the phq sleep item . 
 sleep duration was reported as whole number of hours slept in an average 24-h period over the past month . 
 participants with sleep apnea were identified by self - report as being told by a doctor or other health professional they had sleep apnea . 
 ptsd was assessed using the pcl - c ( 17 ) , a 17-item self - report screening tool for ptsd symptoms during the past 30 days on a 5-point likert scale , ranging from 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( extremely ) . 
 a positive screen for ptsd at baseline was defined as a report of a moderate or higher level of at least one intrusion symptom , three avoidance symptoms , and two hyperarousal symptoms ( criteria established by dsm - iv ) ( 21 ) . 
 major depressive disorder was assessed using nine items from the phq ( sensitivity = 0.93 ; specificity = 0.89 ) corresponding to the depression diagnosis based on the dsm - iv ( 19 ) . 
 a positive screen for depression at baseline was defined as 1 ) endorsement of depressed mood or anhedonia and 2 ) response of  more than half the days  or  nearly every day  to at least five items . other anxiety ( 6 items ) and panic ( 15 items ) symptoms 
 problem drinking was defined using items from the phq on risky behaviors related to alcohol use , such as driving under the influence more than one time over the past year , where endorsement of at least one item indicated problem drinking . 
 binge drinking was defined as consuming five or more drinks ( men ) or four or more drinks ( women ) in 1 day during the past year . 
 smokers were identified as those ever smoking 100 cigarettes in their lifetime , with those persisting in this habit defined as current smokers and those having quit as past smokers . in longitudinal models , service branch , service component , 
 pay grade , military occupation , birth year , race / ethnicity , and education were assessed at baseline . 
 smoking status , alcohol use , bmi , combat deployment , ptsd , depression , anxiety , panic , and all sleep variables were assessed at all available time points . 
 the outcome of interest was incident diagnosed diabetes self - reported on a follow - up survey among people without diabetes at the baseline assessment . at baseline , participants reported if they had ever been told by a doctor or health professional that they had diabetes or 
 at follow - up assessments , participants responded to the same question in regard to the previous 3 years . 
 univariate analyses assessed associations of incident diabetes with sleep , military , demographic , behavioral , and mental health characteristics while accounting for multiple periods of observation per subject . since repeated measurements were available with up to two follow - up assessments per person , generalized estimating equations ( gees ) were used to account for these multiple assessments while adjusting for fixed and time - varying covariates , to estimate adjusted odds of reporting incident diabetes ( 22 ) 
 . incident diabetes was determined at each follow - up assessment , and all covariates were evaluated using data from the previous assessment ( 22 ) . in all multivariable models , adjustments were performed for known type 2 diabetes risk factors captured in the study : age , sex , education , bmi , and race / ethnicity . 
 the final adjusted models were built using a stepwise backward reduction algorithm that retained all significant variables ( p < 0.10 ) ( table 1 ) while always keeping age , sex , race / ethnicity , education , and bmi in the model . 
 additionally , mental health variables were added to the final models to determine if this altered the relationship between sleep and diabetes . 
 first - order interaction terms between retained sleep variables and age , sex , and bmi were tested to determine whether the exposure - outcome associations varied by these characteristics

 baseline demographic , military , and behavioral characteristics of millennium cohort participants by development of diabetes at follow - up 
 a total of 47,093 participants were included in this analysis and followed for up to 6 years . 
 incident diabetes was assessed at each 3-year period separately , with 13,621 participants followed for one 3-year period , and 33,472 participants followed for two 3-year periods . 
 a total of 383 cases occurred during years 03 and 488 cases occurred during years 36 of follow - up . 
 the 488 cases that did not occur until years 36 are also present in the first column of table 1 as not having diabetes from year 03 . at baseline , 
 participants overall were on average young ( 34.9 years of age , sd 9.0 years ) , slightly overweight ( bmi 26.0 kg / m , sd 3.3 ) , 25.6% female , and more likely than not to be white , non - hispanic race , less than college educated , army service branch , and on active duty ( table 1 ) . 
 overall , 871 participants newly self - reported diabetes , for a cumulative annual incidence of 3.6/1,000 person - years . 
 participants who newly self - reported diabetes during follow - up were significantly more likely at baseline to have reported trouble sleeping , sleep duration 5 h , and sleep apnea ( table 1 ) . 
 sleep duration > 8 h was reported by similar proportions of participants with and without newly self - reported diabetes . 
 participants with new - onset diabetes were on average older , had a higher bmi , and were more likely of nonwhite race . 
 characteristics associated with new - onset diabetes included no deployment , having separated from the military since baseline , army or navy / coast guard service branch , reserves / national guard service component , enlisted pay grade , and administration / supply occupation . 
 binge or problem drinking was less likely to have been reported in people reporting new - onset diabetes , and current and former smoking frequency was similar in groups with and without new - onset diabetes . 
 all mental health symptoms occurred significantly more frequently among those who newly reported diabetes during follow - up . 
 factors associated with a higher odds of incident diabetes in models adjusted for sex and known type 2 diabetes risk factors ( age , bmi , education , and race / ethnicity ) included trouble sleeping , sleep duration 5 h compared with 7 h , and sleep apnea ( table 2 ) 
 . several military service characteristics remained significantly related to the outcome , including no deployment , enlisted pay grade , administration / supply occupation , and having separated from the military since baseline ( table 2 ) . 
 binge or problem drinking remained significantly associated , and current smoking emerged as a risk factor for new - onset diabetes after adjustment . screening positive for depression , panic , other anxiety disorder , and ptsd were all significantly associated with higher odds of new - onset diabetes in these adjusted models ( table 2 ) . 
 relative odds of incident self - reported diabetes by each baseline characteristic of interest in the multivariable model ( table 3 ) , sleep characteristics remained significantly and independently associated with higher diabetes odds . 
 the sleep variables that entered the final model included reported trouble sleeping and sleep apnea , which were associated with significant increases in the odds of diabetes of 1.21 to 1.78 , respectively . 
 these associations were not only independent of each other but also the other covariates adjusted for in the model ( table 3 ) . 
 military service characteristics significantly associated with diabetes odds included deployment without combat experience , administration or supply occupations , pay grade , and having separated from the military since baseline . 
 a positive screen for ptsd was significantly associated with higher diabetes odds , independent of sleep characteristics and other covariates in the model , and panic disorder was of borderline significance . 
 tests for interactions between the sleep variables included in the models in table 3 and age , sex , and bmi were all nonsignificant ( p > 0.10 ) . 
 no variable had a variance inflation factor > 4 , indicating that collinearity was unlikely . 
 the model in table 3 was rerun with sleep duration substituted for trouble sleeping but with the other included covariates unchanged . 
 the quasilikelihood information criterion for the model containing trouble sleeping was slightly lower ( 8,640.9 ) than when sleep duration was included in the model ( 8,646.3 ) . 
 the sleep duration variable was insignificant overall in this model ( p = 0.1585 ) , although two sleep categories were significantly related to diabetes odds ( < 5-h odds ratio [ or ] 1.52 [ 95% ci 1.092.14 ] ; 5-h or 1.28 [ 1.011.62 ] ) . 
 several additional modifications of the multivariable model shown in table 3 were conducted . in the first modification , symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder 
 were included in the model to assess whether adjustment for these additional factors altered the association between sleep and diabetes odds . in the second modification , all 
 subjects reporting sleep apnea were removed from the model shown in table 3 . in each of these modifications , 
 the statistical significance of the associations between the sleep variables and diabetes odds remained unchanged , and the associations were of similar magnitude to those seen in table 3 ( data not shown ) . 
 longitudinal multivariable regression model of sleep characteristics and mental health symptoms as risk factors for incident self - reported diabetes in the millennium cohort 
 our study findings confirm that sleep characteristics are associated with subsequent new - onset self - reported diabetes . 
 these associations persisted after adjustment for multiple mental health conditions known to affect sleep duration and quality , including ptsd and depression ( 1113 ) . 
 therefore , it is unlikely that sleep simply serves as a surrogate marker for associated mental health conditions previously shown to predict higher diabetes risk ( 9,10 ) . additionally , participants reporting provider - diagnosed sleep apnea were at higher risk of developing self - reported diabetes during follow - up . 
 although sleep apnea is associated with higher bmi and both altered sleep quality and quantity , adjustment for these variables did not alter the significance of the higher diabetes risk associated with this condition ( 23 ) . 
 overall , these results suggest that the associations between type 2 diabetes risk and mental health conditions and sleep characteristics , if causal , may involve different pathways . whereas trouble sleeping and shorter sleep duration were associated with higher risk of diabetes in a model adjusted for known diabetes risk factors , longer sleep duration was not , in contrast to findings that others have reported ( 4 ) . 
 the reason for this discrepancy is unclear , but it may be due to the relatively younger age of our cohort compared with investigations reporting higher diabetes risk with longer sleep duration ( 24,25 ) . the independent role of mental health conditions associated with poor quality and quantity of sleep in predicting risk of diabetes has only been addressed in a limited manner in previous research . 
 the nurses health study investigators examined sleep as a predictor of incident diabetes in this cohort from 19861996 and adjusted for an assessment of depression based on the short form 36 health survey that was obtained in 1992 , approximately midway through the follow - up period ( 24 ) . 
 thus , it is unclear whether depression preceded or followed diabetes onset during the first 6 years of follow - up . 
 an analysis using the national health and nutrition examination survey i epidemiologic follow - up study adjusted for depression while examining the association between sleep and diabetes incidence , although no association was seen between depression and diabetes incidence in this cohort ( 25 ) . 
 lastly , a prospective study of swedish men assessed the presence of depression with a simple yes / no question ,  do you feel depressed ?  and did not provide information on the accuracy of this question in capturing this condition ( 26 ) . to our knowledge , our study is the first to consider mental health conditions other than depression as potential confounding factors and to measure their occurrence prior to the onset of diabetes . 
 previous prospective research on sleep characteristics and type 2 diabetes risk has not considered whether sleep duration or quality is related to this outcome independent from sleep apnea , a known cause of sleep disturbance . in our fully adjusted analysis , 
 both sleep apnea and trouble sleeping had independent associations with diabetes risk , suggesting that the associations between sleep characteristics and diabetes risk do not merely serve as markers for the presence of sleep - disordered breathing . 
 in addition to the known higher risk of obesity associated with sleep apnea , other factors associated with sleep - disordered breathing may be involved in higher diabetes risk and include abnormal sympathetic activity and release of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-6 ( 27 ) . in support of the latter , we observed an independent association between sleep apnea and diabetes risk after adjustment for bmi . 
 this suggests that manifestations of sleep apnea other than the impact of greater general adiposity may be associated with diabetes risk , although it is possible that incomplete adjustment due to residual confounding occurred due to the inaccuracy of bmi in characterizing body composition . 
 the association between trouble sleeping or shorter sleep duration and diabetes risk independent of associated weight gain and sleep apnea is not well understood , but it may be related to both changes in insulin sensitivity , secretion , and glucose effectiveness . 
 one investigation reported significant or borderline - significant reductions in insulin sensitivity , insulin secretion , glucose effectiveness , and the disposition index immediately after a 5-day period of sleep deprivation ( 4 h of sleep per night ) among 11 healthy lean males in a controlled setting ( 28 ) . 
 all these changes have been associated with higher risk of the development of type 2 diabetes ( 29 ) . 
 several characteristics of military service were significantly associated with lower diabetes risk in multivariable models , including deployment , officer pay grade , and remaining in military service . 
 for most comparisons , military deployment with or without combat exposure was related to a lower risk for diabetes , possibly reflecting selection of people medically fit for deployment who are at lower risk for diabetes . 
 the mental health conditions independently associated with diabetes risk included those characterized by excessive stress , including ptsd and panic disorder . 
 a review of the literature on stress and diabetes risk concluded that both general emotional and job stress were repeatedly associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes in adults ( 30 ) . 
 overactivation of the hypothalamic - pituitary axis and abnormal stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system are thought to accompany excessive levels of stress , with accumulation of visceral fat and promotion of an inflammatory state with greater insulin resistance ( 31 ) . a previous analysis of the members of this cohort recruited in 2001 and followed for 3 years similarly demonstrated a higher diabetes risk associated with ptsd symptoms . 
 first , type 2 diabetes was determined using self - reported data , and it was not confirmed by medical record review . 
 however , because self - reported diabetes compared with physician diagnosis or medical record data have been shown to have a high sensitivity ( 7099% ; median 81% ) and specificity ( 9299% ) , there is less likelihood for misclassification ( 32 ) . 
 also , it is possible that individuals self - reporting type 1 diabetes were included in this analysis . 
 however , individuals with a type 1 diabetes diagnosis in their dod medical records were excluded , although this elimination process would miss those participants no longer receiving care from military treatment facilities after discharge or as reservists . in addition , positive screens for mental disorders were determined from self - report . also , we were unable to adjust for diet or family history , which are known risk factors for diabetes . 
 we expect these findings to generalize to younger populations who are sufficiently healthy to enter into the u.s . 
 armed forces , but it is unclear whether the results would apply to dissimilar populations . 
 self - report of clinician - diagnosed sleep apnea was obtained , and the sensitivity and specificity of this report compared with the medical record are not known . 
 medical encounter data were not used to confirm diagnoses of diabetes or sleep apnea in this cohort due to the potential for some of its members , particularly those in the reserves or national guard , to have received care in non - dod facilities . 
 inaccurate classification of sleep apnea and other covariates potentially may have limited our ability to adjust for confounding . 
 finally , self - reported sleep data were assessed during the prior 4 weeks , and sleep duration was rounded to the nearest whole hour , potentially biasing the estimate of actual sleep time ( 3335 ) . 
 this is the first study , to our knowledge , to examine baseline sleep characteristics in relation to incident diabetes while adjusting for several mental health conditions known to impair sleep and be associated with type 2 diabetes . 
 furthermore , this research was conducted in a large population - based study of active duty and reserve / national guard u.s . military personnel from all service branches . 
 additional strengths include the large sample size and up to 6-year duration of follow - up . 
 moreover , no association was found between reporting type 2 diabetes at baseline and nonresponse to the first follow - up questionnaire among the first panel of enrollees , suggesting that the development of diabetes was unlikely to have influenced the probability of responding to the follow - up survey ( 36 ) . 
 finally , previous evaluations of possible biases suggest the cohort is reasonably representative of military personnel in terms of baseline demographic and mental health characteristics , that participants report health and exposure data reliably , and that enrollment in the study is not influenced by health status ( 14,3740 ) . 
 we conclude that trouble sleeping and sleep apnea predict higher diabetes risk , independent of multiple diabetes risk factors and several mental health conditions . of note 
 , self - reported sleep apnea was also associated with a significantly higher risk for diabetes even after adjustment for other sleep characteristics , bmi , and mental health conditions . 
 substitution of sleep duration for trouble sleeping in multivariable modeling yielded nearly identical results , with significantly higher risk seen with < 6 h of sleep . 
 confirmation of these findings through further analyses may advance our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology and create new opportunities for prevention .","objectiveresearch has suggested that a higher risk of type 2 diabetes associated with sleep characteristics exists . 
 however , studies have not thoroughly assessed the potential confounding effects of mental health conditions associated with alterations in sleep.research design and methodswe prospectively assessed the association between sleep characteristics and self - reported incident diabetes among millennium cohort study participants prospectively followed over a 6-year time period .

"asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes airflow limitation and affects the performance of activities of daily living.1 pharmacological treatment is essential2 and is aimed at achieving and maintaining clinical asthma control.1 inhalation is the most widely used approach for the treatment of asthma because it allows drugs to reach the lungs in a selective manner , increasing drug concentration in the airways and reducing systemic adverse effects . 
 only half of all asthma patients actually use the prescribed medication and do so correctly . 
 5 low treatment adherence is related to the fact that patients do not know how to use or have difficulty in using inhaler devices correctly.3 asthma education can remedy that , being a key component of asthma management.6 
  incorrect inhaler use can lead to treatment failure by reducing drug concentration in the airways and contribute to treatment nonadherence , making clinical asthma control difficult.9 
  the frequency of incorrect use of metered dose inhalers ( mdis ) ranges from 14% to 90% , with an estimated mean of 50%,10 incorrect mdi use reducing lung drug deposition to less than 20% . in a study of patients using inhaled or oral corticosteroids , increased bronchodilator use , nebulizer use , and hospitalizations were observed in more than 50% of the patients who did not adhere to treatment.11 
  instruments ( or scoring systems ) assessing the difficulties that patients face in using inhaled drugs might be useful to reduce those difficulties . by using such instruments , health professionals can devise an educational program targeting the most common errors made by patients , thus improving treatment adherence . 
 there are some scoring systems that assess inhaler technique in patients with lung disease.12 although some assess inhaler technique errors , there is no one system that is considered the gold standard for this purpose 
 . such an instrument could play an important role in the evaluation of patients using inhalers.13 
  leal13 developed a scoring system to assess the difficulties that patients face in using mdis ; the system scores correct and incorrect mdi use , assessing the errors made during mdi use . 
 on the basis of that instrument , santos et al.3 developed scoring systems for the assessment of dry powder inhaler ( dpi ) and mdi technique . 
 although the aforementioned instruments have yet to be validated for use , they are used in our hospital in order to assess inhaler technique in patients with asthma3 and in those with copd . 
 instrument validation allows determination of the congruence between the scoring system used and the reality being measured , thus increasing the reliability of the instrument.14 the use of validated instruments in order to assess inhaler technique in asthma patients will yield results that are more reliable and will ensure data quality . 
 the objectives of the present study were to validate two scores quantifying the ability of patients to use mdis or dpis ; to identify the most common errors made during their use ; and to identify the patients in need of an educational program for the use of these devices . 
 the inclusion criteria were as follows : having been diagnosed with asthma in accordance with the global initiative for asthma criteria15 ; having been in outpatient treatment for at least two years ; being in the 15- to 65-year age bracket ; having had at least four years of schooling ; having no hearing impairment ; and agreeing to participate in the study by giving written informed consent . 
 patients who had previously participated in educational programs regarding the use of asthma medications were excluded . 
 the study was conducted in three phases : validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores ( phase 1 ) ; assessment of the content validity of the two scores ( phase 2 ) ; and assessment of the criterion validity and discriminant validity of the instruments ( phase 3 ) .   in phase 1 , 
 two guest pharmacists ( who were blinded to the study methodology ) simultaneously evaluated inhaler technique . 
 they used the inhaler technique scores developed by santos et al.3 in order to identify the errors made during mdi and dpi use . 
 the instruments provide step - by - step descriptions of mdi and dpi techniques . for each step that is performed correctly , 
 patients receive a score of 1 ; for each step that is performed incorrectly , they receive a score of 0 . for each serious inhaler technique error , 
 the final score determines whether a patient is able or unable to use an mdi or a dpi . 
 the pharmacists were trained in the correct use of the aforementioned scoring systems , in accordance with the guidelines established in the third brazilian consensus on asthma management.16 the following drugs were used in the evaluation : for mdis , 250 g of beclomethasone dipropionate and 100 g of albuterol ; for dpis , 200 g of budesonide and formoterol + budesonide ( 6/200 or 12/400 g ; inhalation capsules ) ; and 50 g of salmeterol xinafoate ( diskus . 
 in phase 2 , an expert panel evaluated the instruments from the previous phase in order to assess their contents . 
 the expert panel comprised three pulmonologists , two pediatric pulmonologists , and two allergists , all of whom had extensive experience in the use of inhalers . 
 the proposed changes were judged in terms of the relevance of the items assessed by the preliminary instruments , the need for additions , deletions , or changes to improve the accuracy of the modified inhaler technique scores being evaluated . 
 after the changes had been systematized by consensus , new mdi and dpi technique scores were developed .   in phase 3 , 
 a new sample of patients using dpis , mdis , or both were randomly selected to participate in the study , the eligibility criteria being the same as those used in the previous phases . 
 they were given placebo - containing inhalers and no instructions on how to use them , being asked to use them in the same manner as they did their own inhalers . 
 each patient was simultaneously evaluated by two other pharmacists , who were blinded to the changes that had been made . 
 they used the instruments derived from phases 1 and 2 and were not allowed to communicate their decisions to one another . 
 after the evaluation , all patients were instructed on how to use inhalers correctly . 
 the median and interquartile range of the scores obtained in phase 3 allowed us to establish cut - off values and divide the patients into two groups : the group of patients who were able to use inhalers and that of those who were not . 
 the latter were then enrolled in our pharmaceutical care program .   in phases 1 and 2 
 , we used a convenience sample based on previous validation studies.14 
 17 
 19 the sample size for phase 3 was calculated on the basis of the hypothesis of an association of at least 60% between the scores given by the pharmacists . considering a power of 0.95 and a type i error of 0.05 
 , we calculated that a sample size of 31 assessments was required for each inhaler type . 
 the results obtained in phases 1 and 2 were described qualitatively . in phase 3 , 
 the mean scores were compared between the observers , agreements and disagreements being evaluated individually . 
 the major errors made during inhaler use ( as assessed by the observers ) were described by frequency .   in phase 3 , descriptive analysis of the absolute values of mdi and dpi technique scores by observer 
 was performed with the statistical package for the social sciences , version 18 ( spss inc . , 
 the degree of correlation between the scores by observer was assessed by cronbach 's alpha coefficient . 
 after assessment of data normality , the scores by observer were compared by means of the mann - whitney rank sum test , their correlation being determined by spearman 's test , with sigmastat software , version 3 ( systat software inc . , 
 the chi - square test was used in order to determine interobserver agreement in the classification of patients as being able or unable to use mdis and dpis . 
 pharmacists together identified the need for changes in the scoring systems and proposed two preliminary changes : removal of the overall score ; and removal of the suggestions section in order to reduce the number of sheets . 
 this resulted in a scoring system consisting of a single table for assessment of inhaler technique , including examples of correct / incorrect inhaler use . 
 interobserver disagreement in phase 1 was found in 19% and 25% of the dpi and mdi scores , respectively , indicating not only inhaler technique errors made by the patients but also interpretation errors made by the observers ( the pharmacists ) . 
 that level of disagreement was considered acceptable and was of relatively little significance , being clarified and resolved in the subsequent phase . 
 the expert panel suggested that two changes be made to the dpi technique score , and both suggestions were accepted : the inclusion of an item regarding patient head position ( at an angle of more than 90 or less than 90 ) , patients receiving 1 point for "" an angle of less than 90 "" and 0 points for "" an angle of more than 90 "" ; and the definition of tlc , which was included at the bottom of the page .   with regard to the mdi technique score 
 , the expert panel suggested that eight changes be made , and all of their suggestions were accepted : the item "" shaking the inhaler "" was changed from "" 3 times "" to "" twice or more "" ; the item "" mode of use "" was changed to "" inhaler use "" ; the score for the item "" in the mouth , with a spacer "" was changed to 1 because it provides a correct example of mdi use , as does the item "" out of the mouth , without a spacer "" ; the item "" time point "" was changed to "" time point ( rapid inhalation ) "" ; the items "" upon actuation "" and "" immediately after actuation "" have the same weight and were therefore merged ; the item "" only sprays it into the mouth and does not inhale "" was changed to "" the device is actuated directly into the mouth , and the patient does not inhale "" ; the item "" not completely "" was changed to "" insufficient "" , whereas the item "" adequately "" was changed to "" sufficient "" ; and the item "" interval "" was changed to "" time between mdi actuations "" . 
 according to all observers and experts , the resulting scoring systems were more practical ( chart 1 ) . 
 although the maximum total score remained the same ( i.e. , nine points ) for the instrument assessing mdi technique , it increased ( to six points ) for the instrument assessing dpi technique . according to the literature , a 20% variation in the total score is acceptable for a patient to be considered able to use an inhaler correctly . 
 for the present study , this means a minimum mdi technique score of 7.2 and a minimum dpi technique score of 4.8 ; however , it is not clear whether the aforementioned variation ( standard deviation ) takes into account whether a given patient received previous training in inhaler use . 
 of those patients , 39 were assessed with the mdi technique score and 50 were assessed with the dpi technique score , a total of 89 assessments being performed . 
 those assessments allowed us to identify the most common difficulties encountered / errors made during inhaler use . 
 the most relevant difficulty encountered during the use of both types of devices was the maintenance of tlc after a deep inhalation . 
 the number of errors made was higher during mdi use than during dpi use ( table 1 ) . 
 errors identified in more than 50% of all tests performed included & lt ; 60 s between mdi actuations , maintenance of tlc for & lt ; 10 s after inhalation , incorrect speed of inhalation , incorrect mdi use without a spacer , and not exhaling prior to inhalation .   among the patients who used a dpi , 
 the most common errors were maintenance of tlc for & lt ; 10 s , not exhaling prior to inhalation , and incorrect speed of inhalation ( in 75% , 62% , and 57% , respectively ) , as shown in table 2 .   of a sample of 72 patients , 60 
 did not hold their breath correctly , 58 inhaled too quickly , and 6 did not synchronize inhaler actuation with inhalation . 
 median mdi technique scores in phase 3 of the study were 4 and 5 for observers 1 and 2 , respectively ( table 3 ) . 
 median dpi technique scores were 4.5 and 5.0 for observers 1 and 2 , respectively . 
 the degree of correlation of the scores by observer was 0.97 , as assessed by cronbach 's alpha coefficient . 
 the correlation was statistically significant ( p & lt ; 0.0001 ) , as assessed by spearman 's correlation coefficient ( figure 1 ) . 
 there were no significant differences between the scores given by each observer , as assessed by the mann - whitney test . 
 all patients whose mdi and dpi technique scores were & lt ; 4 were enrolled in an educational program . 
 with regard to discriminant validity , there was good interobserver agreement in the classification of patients as being able / unable to use a dpi ( 50%/50% and 52%/58% ; p & lt ; 0.01 ) and an mdi ( 49%/51% and 54%/46% ; p & lt ; 0.05 ) . 
 the present study allowed assessment of the content validity , criterion validity , and discriminant validity of the dpi and mdi scores . 
 it also allowed identification of the major difficulties that patients encounter when using inhaler devices for the treatment of asthma . 
 finally , it allowed determination of cut - off scores to classify patients as being able or unable to use their inhalers , the latter patients being enrolled in an educational program .   to the best of our knowledge , 
 there is only one validation study of mdi technique scores ( in patients with asthma)12 and one of dpi technique scores ( in patients with copd).21 in addition , according to basheti et al.,22 although the use of device - specific checklists is the most feasible method for assessing inhaler technique , little evidence is available to assess the relative importance of different criteria . 
 divergence between the scoring systems for the same inhaler device in different studies makes direct comparison of results difficult . in our study , 
 mdi and dpi technique scores were validated in asthma patients , and the results allowed us to identify mdi and dpi technique errors and address them in a personalized manner , meaning that the instructions provided to patients were based on their own inhaler technique errors .

 our findings corroborate those of other studies.9 
 23 
 24 the inability to hold their breath for more than 10 s after inhalation was the major difficulty that our patients encountered during mdi and dpi use ( 83% and 75% , respectively ) . 
 manzella et al.12 assessed inhaler technique and reported that 69% of the patients studied did not hold their breath for at least 10 s. a review compiling the results of 12 studies ( including 955 patients ) identified the most common errors made by patients using inhaler devices , less than 10 s of breath - holding after inhalation having been observed in 26% . 
 a period of 10 s of breath - holding increases drug deposition in the lungs by allowing more time for the particles to settle.25 the author of the aforementioned review reported that 50% of the patients were able to hold their breath for 10 s between doses . in our study , less than 10 s of breath - holding after inhalation was the most common error made during mdi use , having been made by 89% of those who used mdis . 
 a period of 10 s of breath - holding is important to ensure that a greater quantity of drug reaches the airways.12

 incorrect speed of inhalation was the third most common mdi technique error in our study and was reported by mcfadden as the third most common error in 12 studies , inappropriately rapid inspiratory flow rates having been observed in 19% of the total of patients . 
 this is a serious error , given that a slower inspiratory flow rate translates to higher lung drug deposition with the use of mdis.25 
  not exhaling prior to inhalation was an error made by 62% of the patients using dpis , being the second most common dpi technique error . 
 the lung volume at the beginning of inhalation interferes with drug deposition , which is why patients should exhale before inhaling.26

 incorrect speed of inhalation was the third most common dpi technique error ( 57% ) . in order to deliver medication , dpis depend on patient inspiratory flow . 
 if the flow rate ( volume / time ) is lower than required , the inhaled doses will be lower , and this contributes to treatment failure.8 
 27 
  sandrini et al.28 analyzed mdi use in a sample of patients , classifying inhaler technique as correct , slightly incorrect , moderately incorrect , or clearly incorrect . 
 the most common errors were placing the inhaler in the mouth ( 68.0% ) , inhaling before actuation ( 15.5% ) , inhaling too quickly ( 11.0% ) , and inhaling through the nose ( 9.0% ) . 
 although our method of evaluation differed from that used in the aforementioned study , our patients made the same errors as did those in that study . 
 dalcin et al.24 and souza et al.29 used checklists or forms in order to determine whether patients were using their inhalers correctly at work . 
 souza et al.29 found that 54.5% of the patients who used dpis did not exhale properly before inhaling the medication . 
 this finding is consistent with those of the present study , because that was the second most common error made by our patients . 
 dalcin et al.24 found that the patients who used mdis made more errors than did those who used other types of inhalers , a finding that is also consistent with those of the present study .

 dpi : dry powder inhaler ; mdi : metered dose inhaler ; and ir : interquartile range .   in the aforementioned studies 
 , the instruments used allowed the authors to quantify and classify the errors made by patients . 
 we found no technical differences between the mdi and dpi techniques used at our institution and those described in the third brazilian consensus on asthma management6 or in the 2012 brazilian thoracic association guidelines for asthma management.1 however , in addition to providing a step - by - step description of inhaler technique , the scoring systems used in the present study are tools that health professionals can use in order to assess objectively and mathematically the errors that patients make when using inhaler devices . in addition , patients can be classified as able or unable to use their inhalers on the basis of their cut - off scores . 
 this allows health professionals to monitor improvements in inhaler technique in an objective manner . 
 our results show that the proportion of mdi technique errors was higher than that of dpi technique errors . 
 this difference might be related to the fact that the correct dpi technique is more easily understandable to patients than is the correct mdi technique . 
 the results showed that incorrect inhaler use affects drug efficacy , and the authors reported that assessment of inhaler technique is still considered irrelevant by many health professionals.21 
  in a study conducted in 2011 in the state of bahia , brazil , inhaler technique errors were assessed , and the proportion of errors was found to be low . 
 this was attributed to the fact that the patients in that study were monitored at an asthma referral center ; they periodically received instructions and refresher training on inhaler technique from a multidisciplinary team.5 
  one of the limitations of the present study is the lack of follow - up . 
 a follow - up evaluation might have allowed us to determine whether there were improvements in inhaler technique . 
 the present study was biased by the fact that the proportion of mdi technique errors was high , with median scores of 4 and 5 for observers 1 and 2 , respectively ; these scores are significantly different from the score of 7.2 suggested in the literature . given that interobserver agreement was high when a cut - off score of less than 4 was used - a finding that suggests that the mdi score has good accuracy - it can be inferred that many patients were classified as being able to use an mdi despite the fact that they did not obtain the minimum score predicted in theory , i.e. , 20% of a maximum total score of 9 . 
 this underscores the need for reassessing inhaler technique at each visit and for sequential use of the mdi score in a large population sample 
 .   the new mdi and dpi scores will allow the implementation of educational programs proposed in asthma management guidelines and strategies , which recommend that patients receive ongoing training in inhaler technique to ensure correct inhaler use . by providing pharmaceutical care 
 , pharmacists can instruct patients on how to use their inhaler devices correctly . by using our inhaler technique scores , 
 pharmacists can assess inhaler technique errors and determine whether patients are able to achieve an ideal level of technical correctness ( of 80% ) and maintain it throughout the educational program . 
 the present study showed that our inhaler technique scores can reveal exactly what it is that patients are doing incorrectly when using mdis or dpis so that the educational program during follow - up can focus on their errors rather than repeating what they already know . 
 inhalation is the most widely used approach for the treatment of asthma , and correct inhaler technique is directly related to the therapeutic efficacy of the drug . 
 therefore , correct inhaler technique is essential for the efficacy of pharmacological treatment.3 we believe that the present study is clinically relevant because it validated objective mdi and dpi technique scores that can reveal the major difficulties encountered by patients using mdis or dpis and provided cut - off scores that can be used in order to classify patients as being able or unable to use their inhalers . by using the validated scores 
 , health professionals will be able to identify and correct inhaler technique errors during visits and , as a result , improve inhaler use .

 a dificuldade mais relevante no uso de ambos os dispositivos foi a manuteno da capacidade pulmonar total aps inspirao profunda . 
 o grau de correlao dos escores por observador foi de 0,97 ( p & lt ; 0,0001 ) . 
 houve boa concordncia interobservador na classificao dos pacientes como aptos / no aptos para uso de ipo ( 50%/50% e 52%/58% ; p & lt ; 0,01 ) e de ip ( 49%/51% e 54%/46% ; p & lt ; 0,05 ) . 
 os escores validados permitem identificar e corrigir os erros da tcnica inalatria ao longo das consultas e , em consequncia , melhorar o manejo dos dispositivos para inalao . 
 a asma  uma doena crnica inflamatria que limita o fluxo areo e pode impedir que os pacientes exeram suas atividades dirias adequadamente.1 o tratamento farmacolgico  essencial2 e tem como objetivo alcanar e manter o controle clnico da doena.1 a inalao  a via mais utilizada para o tratamento da asma porque permite que os medicamentos alcancem seletivamente os pulmes , com maior concentrao do frmaco nas vias areas , reduzindo os efeitos adversos sistmicos.1

  apenas metade dos asmticos utiliza , de fato e corretamente , a medicao prescrita.5 destaca - se que o baixo ndice de adeso est relacionado ao desconhecimento e / ou  dificuldade de administrao dos medicamentos para inalao.3 tais aspectos podem ser melhorados se a educao em asma ocorrer , sendo ela um componente estratgico para o controle da doena.6 
  a utilizao incorreta dos inaladores pode acarretar o insucesso teraputico por diminuir a concentrao do frmaco nas vias areas e contribuir para a no adeso ao tratamento , dificultando o controle clnico da asma.9 
  a frequncia de uso incorreto de inalador pressurizado ( ip ) varia entre 14% e 90% , com uma mdia estimada de 50%,10 acarretando deposio pulmonar do medicamento inferior a 20% . 
 um estudo com pacientes que faziam uso de corticoterapia inalatria ou oral apontou que mais de 50% dos pacientes que no eram aderentes ao tratamento apresentavam maior uso de broncodilatadores e nebulizaes , alm do aumento no nmero de hospitalizaes.11 
  a utilizao de instrumentos ( ou escores ) que meam e pontuem as dificuldades dos pacientes durante o uso dos seus medicamentos para inalao pode ser til para reduzi - las . 
 ao utilizar esses instrumentos , o profissional de sade pode elaborar um programa educacional direcionado para os principais erros cometidos pelo paciente , revertendo assim a baixa adeso ao tratamento . 
 existem alguns escores que avaliam o uso correto desses inaladores em portadores de molstias pulmonares.12 alguns deles avaliam os erros na utilizao desses dispositivos para inalao ; porm , no existe um escore considerado padro - ouro com essa finalidade . 
 tal instrumento poderia ser um diferencial na avaliao de pacientes que utilizam esses dispositivos.13 
  leal13 desenvolveu um escore para avaliao das dificuldades dos pacientes no uso de ips ; tal escore pontua acertos e erros na utilizao dos dispositivos , promovendo a valorao dos erros . 
 a partir daquele instrumento , santos et al.3 desenvolveram escores para a avaliao de inaladores de p ( ipo ) e ip . 
 esses instrumentos ainda no esto validados e so utilizados em nosso hospital para a mensurao da qualidade da tcnica de uso dos dispositivos para inalao por pacientes asmticos3 e portadores de dpoc .   a validao de um instrumento permite verificar a congruncia entre o escore que  utilizado para realizar uma mensurao e a realidade que  medida , aumentando a confiabilidade do mesmo.14 ao se utilizar instrumentos validados para medir a tcnica de inalao de pacientes asmticos , sero obtidos resultados mais fidedignos e com maior garantia da qualidade dos dados 
 .   os objetivos do presente estudo foram validar os escores para a avaliao da tcnica de uso de ips e ipos em portugus do brasil , verificar quais erros so mais comuns durante a utilizao desses dispositivos e identificar quais pacientes necessitam de sesses de treinamento para essa utilizao . 
 trata - se de um estudo aberto e prospectivo desenvolvido em um hospital universitrio de referncia . 
 os pacientes foram selecionados de acordo com os seguintes critrios de incluso : apresentar diagnstico de asma de acordo com os critrios da global initiative for asthma,15 estar em seguimento ambulatorial por pelo menos dois anos , ter idade entre 15 e 65 anos , ter cursado no mnimo quatro anos do ensino fundamental , ter sua capacidade auditiva preservada e concordar em participar do estudo , assinando o termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido . 
 pacientes que j haviam participado de programas educacionais sobre a utilizao de medicamentos para asma foram excludos . 
 inicialmente , foi realizada a validao da confiabilidade dos escores de uso dos inaladores ( etapa 1 ) e a de seu contedo ( etapa 2 ) . 
 na etapa 3 foram realizados os testes para a validao de critrio e a validao discriminante desses novos instrumentos . 
 na etapa 1 , dois farmacuticos convidados ( cegos em relao  metodologia do estudo ) avaliaram simultaneamente a tcnica de uso dos inaladores . 
 aplicaram os escores para ipo e ip , elaborados por santos et al.,3 para elencar os erros apresentados . 
 esses escores detalham o passo a passo da tcnica para cada tipo de inalador . o paciente recebe um ponto a cada etapa executada de modo correto , e , quando a tcnica  feita de modo incorreto , o paciente no recebe pontos . 
 se o paciente comete erros graves , esses so subtrados . a pontuao determina se o paciente est apto ou no para utilizar o dispositivo para inalao 
 . os farmacuticos foram treinados quanto  correta utilizao dos escores acima referidos , seguindo as diretrizes do iii consenso brasileiro de manejo da asma.16 para essa avaliao foram utilizados os seguintes medicamentos : a ) ip : dipropionato de beclometasona 250 g e salbutamol 100 g ; b ) ipo : budesonida 200 g e formoterol + budesonida ( 6/200 ou 12/400 g ; cpsulas inalatrias ) ; e xinafoato de salmeterol 50 g ( diskus . 
 na etapa 2 , os escores oriundos da etapa anterior foram avaliados por expertos com o objetivo de mensurar o contedo desses instrumentos . o grupo de expertos foi constitudo por trs pneumologistas , dois pneumopediatras e dois alergistas , todos com slida experincia no uso de inaladores .   as modificaes propostas foram 
 julgadas quanto  pertinncia dos itens medidos pelos escores preliminares , avaliando - se a necessidade de incluses , excluses ou alteraes para melhorar a acurcia dos escores modificados . 
 depois que as alteraes foram sistematizadas por consenso , procedeu - se  elaborao de novos escores para ips e ipos . 
 na etapa 3 , novos pacientes utilizando ipo , ip ou ambos foram convidados a participar do estudo , de forma aleatria , para uma avaliao individual , obedecidos os mesmos critrios de elegibilidade das etapas anteriores . 
 foi - lhes solicitado , sem nenhuma orientao prvia , que utilizassem inaladores contendo placebo e que realizassem a mesma tcnica da sua rotina de tratamento . 
 cada paciente foi avaliado simultaneamente por outros dois farmacuticos , cegos em relao s modificaes realizadas , utilizando os escores derivados das etapas 1 e 2 , sendo vetado qualquer tipo de contato entre os avaliadores sobre os valores emitidos . 
 aps as avaliaes , todos os pacientes foram orientados sobre o modo correto do uso dos inaladores . 
 a mediana e o intervalo interquartil dos escores obtidos nessa fase permitiram a determinao dos valores de corte e a diviso dos pacientes em dois grupos : pacientes aptos e pacientes no aptos a utilizar os dispositivos para inalao . 
 os pacientes no aptos foram ento encaminhados ao programa de ateno farmacutica existente em nossa instituio . 
 para as etapas 1 e 2 foi utilizada uma amostra de convenincia baseada em estudos de validao anteriores . 
 para a etapa 3 calculamos a amostra baseados na hiptese de que a associao entre os escores pontuados pelos farmacuticos seria de pelo menos 60% . 
 considerando um poder de 0,95 e um erro tipo i de 0,05 , a amostra indicada 
 na etapa 3 , os valores mdios dos escores foram comparados entre os observadores , avaliando - se as concordncias e divergncias individualmente . 
 na etapa 3 , a anlise descritiva dos valores absolutos dos escores para cada dispositivo , por observador , foi realizada usando o programa statistical package for the social sciences , verso 18 ( spss inc . , chicago , il , eua ) . 
 os graus de correlao entre os escores e por observador foram avaliados utilizando - se o coeficiente alfa de cronbach . 
 aps a avaliao de normalidade , a comparao entre os escores por observador foi realizada atravs do teste de mann - whitney ( rank sum ) e sua correlao pelo teste de spearman , utilizando o programa sigmastat , verso 3 ( systat software inc . , san jose , ca , eua ) . 
 o teste do qui - quadrado foi utilizado para avaliar a concordncia dos grupos de pacientes ( aptos ou no aptos para utilizao dos inaladores ) entre os avaliadores . 
 farmacuticos em conjunto identificaram a necessidade de alteraes em determinados campos dos escores e propuseram duas modificaes preliminares : a retirada da pontuao geral dada ao paciente e a retirada do campo de sugestes para diminuir o nmero de folhas do escore . 
 foi criado um escore com uma nica tabela para a avaliao da tcnica do uso dos inaladores , com os acertos / erros que os pacientes poderiam cometer . a discordncia entre os avaliadores na etapa 1 ocorreu em 19% e 25% em relao aos escores para ipo e ip , respectivamente , indicando no somente erros 
 essas discordncias foram consideradas aceitveis na aplicao dos escores e proporcionalmente pouco significativas , sendo esclarecidas e dirimidas na etapa seguinte . 
 na avaliao dos escores pelos expertos , foram sugeridas e acatadas duas modificaes no escore para ipo : acrescentar um campo sobre a posio da cabea do paciente ( ngulo maior ou menor que 90 ) , sendo atribudo um ponto para "" ngulo menor que 90 "" e zero para "" ngulo maior que 90 "" ; e o significado da sigla cpt , adicionado ao final do escore . 
 em relao ao escore para ip , os especialistas fizeram oito sugestes de modificaes que foram acatadas : o item "" agitao do dispositivo "" foi alterado de "" 3 vezes "" para "" 2 vezes ou mais "" ; o campo "" modo "" foi alterado para "" modo de uso "" ; a pontuao do item "" dentro da boca com espaador "" foi alterada para um ponto por ser to correto quanto  forma de utilizao do inalador no item "" fora da boca sem espaador "" ; no campo "" momento "" , foi adicionado o item "" inspirao rpida "" ; os itens "" junto ao acionamento "" e "" logo depois do acionamento "" possuem o mesmo peso e foram unificados ; o item "" s jogar na boca ou no inspirar "" foi alterado para "" acionamento direto na boca e no inspirar "" ; no campo "" profundidade "" o item "" no completamente "" foi modificado para "" insuficiente "" , enquanto o item "" adequadamente "" foi alterado para "" suficiente "" ; e o campo "" intervalo "" foi alterado para "" intervalo entre os acionamentos "" . 
 os escores resultantes foram considerados mais prticos por avaliadores e expertos ( quadro 1 ) . o novo escore para ip manteve a pontuao total mxima ( nove pontos ) , mas houve um aumento na pontuao do escore novo para ipo ( seis pontos ) . 
 de acordo com a literatura , para se considerar que um paciente conhece e domina a utilizao correta do tipo de inalador , o escore obtido por ele pode apresentar uma variao aceitvel de 20% . 
 isso significa uma pontuao mnima de 7,2 e de 4,8 para os escores para ip e ipo , respectivamente ; entretanto , no est definido se essa variao ( desvio - padro ) leva em considerao se o paciente foi treinado anteriormente para o uso do inalador . 
 participaram da etapa 3 do estudo 72 pacientes , com mdia de idade de 41 anos , sendo 82% do sexo feminino . 
 esses pacientes geraram 89 avaliaes , sendo 39 pacientes avaliados com o escore para a tcnica de uso de ip e 50 pacientes com o escore para a de ipo . 
 essas avaliaes permitiram elencar as principais dificuldades / erros dos pacientes no uso de dispositivos para inalao . 
 o erro mais relevante entre os pacientes avaliados quanto ao uso de ambos os tipos de inaladores foi a falta de manuteno da cpt aps a inspirao profunda . 
 observou - se um maior nmero de erros entre os pacientes com o uso do ip ( tabela 1 ) . 
 o intervalo entre as doses & lt ; 60 s , a manuteno da cpt & lt ; 10 s aps a inalao , a velocidade da inspirao inadequada , o uso inadequado do ip sem espaador e a ausncia de realizao de expirao antes da inalao foram erros cometidos em mais de 50% dos testes realizados . 
 entre os pacientes que utilizaram ipo , os erros mais comuns foram a manuteno da cpt & lt ; 10 s , a ausncia de expirao antes da inalao e a velocidade inadequada da inspirao ( em 75% , 62% e 57% , respectivamente ) , conforme demonstrado na tabela 2 
 . de uma amostra de 72 pacientes , 60 pacientes no realizaram a pausa inspiratria de maneira correta ; 58 pacientes realizaram a inspirao muito rpida ; e 6 pacientes no sincronizaram o incio da inspirao com o acionamento do dispositivo . 
 nas mensuraes para o escore para ip realizadas na etapa 3 , os valores encontrados por avaliador , em mediana , foram 4 e 5 pontos para os observadores 1 e 2 , respectivamente , conforme mostrado na tabela 3 . 
 o grau de correlao entre os escores avaliados por observador , utilizando - se o coeficiente alfa de cronbach , foi de 0,97 . 
 essa correlao foi estatisticamente significativa usando - se a correlao de spearman ( p & lt ; 0,0001 ) , como se observa na figura 1 . 
 o teste de mann - whitney confirmou que os valores atribudos aos escores pelos dois avaliadores no foram estatisticamente diferentes . 
 foram encaminhados ao programa de educao pacientes com valor de escore & lt ; 4 pontos tanto para os escores para ip quanto para ipo . 
 esse foi o menor valor inteiro da mediana de avaliao concordante entre os dois observadores . 
 para a validao discriminante , encontrou - se uma concordncia entre os grupos de pacientes aptos e de no aptos ( necessitando de um programa de educao ) indicados pelo observador 1 e pelo observador 2 , tanto para o escore para ipo ( 50%/50% e 52%/58% ; p & lt ; 0,01 ) quanto para o escore para ip ( 49%/51% e 54%/46% ; p & lt ; 0,05 ) . 
 o presente estudo possibilitou a validao de contedo , de critrio e de discriminante dos escores para ipo e ip , permitindo tambm elencar as maiores dificuldades encontradas pelos pacientes no uso dos dispositivos para inalao no tratamento da asma , alm de determinar uma nota de corte , classificando os pacientes como aptos a utilizar seus inaladores ou identificar aqueles que necessitavam ser encaminhados para um programa educacional . 
 no melhor do nosso conhecimento atual , encontramos na literatura pesquisada um estudo que validou escores para ip para pacientes asmticos12 e , no caso de escores para ipo , somente um estudo com pacientes com dpoc.21 alm disso , segundo basheti et al.22 apesar de o uso de check - lists para um inalador especifico ser o mtodo mais vivel de avaliao , existem poucas evidncias para avaliar a importncia relativa dos diferentes critrios . as divergncias dos sistemas de pontuao para o mesmo dispositivo para inalao em diferentes estudos dificultam a comparao direta dos resultados . 
 considerando que o nosso estudo validou escores tanto para ip quanto para ipo para pacientes asmticos , os resultados obtidos nos permitiram pontuar erros em ambos e trat - los de forma personalizada , de modo que todos os pacientes puderam ser orientados sobre o modo correto de utilizao desses dispositivos com base em seus erros de execuo da tcnica .

 a capacidade de prender a respirao por mais de 10 s aps a inalao foi a dificuldade mais importante entre os pacientes do nosso estudo , tanto para ip como para ipo ( 83% e 75% , respectivamente ) . 
 manzella et al.12 avaliaram a tcnica inalatria e relataram que 69% dos pacientes avaliados no prendiam a respirao por no mnimo 10 s. uma reviso que compilou resultados de 12 estudos ( 955 pacientes includos ) classificou os erros mais cometidos pelos pacientes , sendo que a dificuldade de prender a respirao por 10 s aps a inalao ocorria em 26% da populao . 
 esse tempo determinado de prender a respirao  importante para que ocorra uma maior sedimentao das partculas do medicamento nos pulmes.25 
  o autor da reviso tambm relatou que 50% dos pacientes faziam a pausa de tempo necessria entre as doses . 
 no nosso estudo , esse foi o erro mais frequentemente ( 89% ) encontrado em relao ao escore para ip . 
 esse passo da tcnica  importante para garantir que uma maior quantidade do medicamento alcance as vias areas.12

 a velocidade de inalao inadequada , terceira dificuldade mais comumente encontrada em nosso estudo para ip , foi igualmente relatada por mcfadden como a terceira dificuldade mais frequentemente observada em 12 estudos , sendo que , no total , 19% dos pacientes realizavam a inalao de forma muito rpida . 
 esse erro  grave , pois quanto mais devagar  a taxa de medicamento inalado , maior ser a deposio pulmonar desse medicamento com o uso de ip.25 
  em relao ao ipo , a ausncia de expirao antes da inalao foi verificada em 62% dos casos , sendo a segunda dificuldade mais frequente para esse tipo de inalador . 
 o volume pulmonar existente no incio da inspirao interfere na deposio da droga e  por isso que se recomenda a realizao da expirao antes do incio da inalao.26 
  a velocidade de inspirao inadequada foi o terceiro erro mais comumente encontrado ( 57% ) no uso de ipo . 
 no caso desses dispositivos para inalao , a sada do medicamento  decorrente do fluxo inspiratrio que o paciente realiza . 
 se o fluxo ( volume / tempo ) for menor que o necessrio , as doses inaladas sero reduzidas , e esse  um fator importante para o insucesso teraputico . 
 sandrini et al.28 analisaram o uso de ip em uma amostra de pacientes , classificando a tcnica de inalao em correta , pouco errada , com erro intermedirio e muito errada . 
 os autores classificaram a tcnica de 48% dos pacientes como no correta . os erros mais encontrados foram colocao do inalador dentro da boca ( 68,0% ) ; inspirao antes de acionar o jato ( 15,5% ) ; inspirao rpida ( 11,0% ) ; e inspirao pelo nariz ( 9,0% ) . 
 esses erros tambm foram encontrados em nossos pacientes , mesmo com o modo de avaliao diferente do utilizado naquele estudo . 
 dalcin et al.24 e souza et al.29 utilizaram listas ou fichas de controle para verificar a utilizao adequada dos inaladores pelos pacientes em seus trabalhos . 
 souza et al.29 encontraram que 54,5% dos pacientes avaliados que faziam uso de ipo no realizavam a expirao antes da inalao de forma adequada . 
 esse achado corrobora o nosso , pois esse foi o segundo erro mais comumente encontrado na avaliao de nossos pacientes . 
 j dalcin et al.24 encontraram um maior nmero de erros nos pacientes que utilizavam ip quando comparados aos que usavam outros inaladores , sendo esse achado tambm igual ao nosso . 
 fato que , nos trabalhos acima citados , os instrumentos utilizados permitiram aos autores quantificar e classificar os erros cometidos pelos pacientes . 
 comparando as tcnicas de inalao para o uso de ip e ipo publicadas no iii consenso de asma16 e nas diretrizes para o manejo de asma de 2012,1 verifica - se que as orientaes no diferem tecnicamente das utilizadas em nossa instituio . 
 entretanto , verificamos que os escores utilizados no presente estudo , alm de especificarem o passo a passo da tcnica de inalao , so uma ferramenta para que o profissional de sade possa mensurar , de forma objetiva e matemtica , os erros cometidos pelos pacientes . 
 alm disso , eles possibilitam verificar se o paciente est apto ou no a utilizar seu inalador atravs da especificao de uma nota de corte . 
 isso tambm permite que o profissional de sade acompanhe objetivamente a evoluo do paciente quanto a sua tcnica de inalao . 
 nossos resultados demonstram que a proporo de erros no escore para ip foi maior do que no para ipo . 
 essa diferena na proporo de erro entre os dispositivos pode estar associada  maior facilidade na compreenso da tcnica de uso de ipo em detrimento quela de ip por parte dos pacientes . 
 destacamos que lavorini et al.21 realizaram uma reviso da literatura com 47 artigos que analisavam a tcnica do uso do ipo . 
 os resultados demonstram que o uso incorreto de inaladores influencia a eficcia da droga , e os autores destacam que a avaliao do uso correto dos inaladores ainda  considerada irrelevante por muitos profissionais de sade.21 
  em um estudo realizado em 2011 na bahia , foram avaliados os erros que os pacientes cometiam ao utilizar os seus inaladores ; encontrou - se baixa proporo de erros na tcnica inalatria . 
 tais resultados foram associados ao acompanhamento em um centro de referncia em asma que os pacientes daquele estudo recebiam ; eles participavam de peridicas orientaes e revises acerca da tcnica inalatria , realizadas por uma equipe multiprofissional.5 
  como limitao do estudo , pode - se indicar a falta de seguimento dos pacientes avaliados aps o mesmo . 
 tal acompanhamento poderia permitir que se determinasse a evoluo da tcnica do uso dos inaladores pelos pacientes . 
 um vis do presente estudo ocorreu porque os pacientes apresentaram um alto ndice de erros ao utilizarem ip ( mediana de 4 e 5 pontos para os avaliadores 1 e 2 , respectivamente ) , distantes dos valores tericos de 7,2 pontos sugeridos pela literatura . 
 como os resultados obtidos pelos dois avaliadores foram altamente concordantes usando uma nota de corte menor que 4 pontos , sugerindo boa acurcia do escore , pode - se inferir que os observadores classificaram muitos pacientes como aptos para o uso do ip apesar de no terem atingido a pontuao mnima prevista em teoria ( 20% de 9 pontos mximos ) . 
 isso refora a necessidade de reavaliao do uso do inalador a cada consulta e a utilizao sequencial desse escore em uma grande amostra populacional . 
 estes novos escores permitiro a execuo de programas educacionais , propostos em diretrizes e estratgias para o tratamento da asma . 
 segundo esses documentos , os pacientes precisam receber treinamento contnuo sobre a tcnica de inalao para que se possa garantir a utilizao correta do inalador . o farmacutico , por meio da ateno farmacutica , pode 
 orientar o paciente quanto ao manejo dos dispositivos para inalao e , ao utilizar nossos escores , pode quantificar os acertos / erros e mensurar se o paciente alcana e mantm o ideal de 80% de correo na tcnica ao longo do programa de educao . os escores no presente estudo demonstraram ser capazes de especificar em qual passo os pacientes esto errando , permitindo direcionar o programa educativo durante o acompanhamento sem repetir o que paciente j sabe . 
 a inalao  a via mais utilizada para o tratamento da asma , e a realizao de uma tcnica correta na utilizao dos dispositivos est diretamente relacionada  eficcia teraputica do medicamento . 
 sendo assim , a execuo correta da tcnica de inalao  essencial para que o tratamento farmacolgico seja eficaz.3 acreditamos que o presente estudo , ao validar escores objetivos para o uso de ip e de ipo que especificam as maiores dificuldades encontradas pelos pacientes no uso dos dispositivos e uma nota de corte , assim como classifica os pacientes como aptos a utilizar seus inaladores ou no , pode ser de relevncia clnica . 
 o profissional de sade ser capaz , por meio desses escores validados , de identificar e corrigir os erros do paciente ao longo das consultas e , consequentemente , melhorar o manejo dos inaladores .","abstractobjective : to validate two scores quantifying the ability of patients to use metered dose inhalers ( mdis ) or dry powder inhalers ( dpis ) ; to identify the most common errors made during their use ; and to identify the patients in need of an educational program for the use of these devices . 
 methods : this study was conducted in three phases : validation of the reliability of the inhaler technique scores ; validation of the contents of the two scores using a convenience sample ; and testing for criterion validation and discriminant validation of these instruments in patients who met the inclusion criteria . 
 results : the convenience sample comprised 16 patients . 
 interobserver disagreement was found in 19% and 25% of the dpi and mdi scores , respectively . 
 after expert analysis on the subject , the scores were modified and were applied in 72 patients . 
 the most relevant difficulty encountered during the use of both types of devices was the maintenance of total lung capacity after a deep inhalation . 
 the degree of correlation of the scores by observer was 0.97 ( p & lt ; 0.0001 ) . 
 there was good interobserver agreement in the classification of patients as able / not able to use a dpi ( 50%/50% and 52%/58% ; p & lt ; 0.01 ) and an mdi ( 49%/51% and 54%/46% ; p & lt ; 0.05 ) . 
 conclusions : the validated scores allow the identification and correction of inhaler technique errors during consultations and , as a result , improvement in the management of inhalation devices .",pubmed

 written informed consent and assent ( if applicable ) were obtained before any evaluations were conducted for eligibility . 
 the phase 1 study was a first - in - human , open - label , escalating - dose study to assess the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of a single intrathecal dose ( 1 , 3 , 6 , or 9 mg ) of nusinersen in children with spinal muscular atrophy . 
 each dose cohort had 6 to 10 participants ( n = 28 ) . upon completion , 
 all participants had the opportunity to enroll in a subsequent extension study and receive additional dosing with nusinersen . 
 the methods and results of the phase 1 study and its extension are detailed elsewhere . 
 briefly , medically stable spinal muscular atrophy participants 2 to 14 years of age were enrolled in 4 sites in the united states ( boston children s hospital , boston , ma ; columbia university medical center , new york , ny ; ut southwestern medical center  children s medical center dallas , dallas , tx ; and university of utah school of medicine , salt lake city , ut ) . 
 eligible participants had to be able to complete all study procedures , meet age - appropriate institutional guidelines for lumbar puncture procedures , and have a life expectancy of > 2 years . 
 participants were excluded for serious respiratory insufficiency , hospitalization for surgery or pulmonary event within the past 2 months , active infection at screening , history of brain or spinal cord disease or bacterial meningitis , presence of implanted cerebrospinal fluid drainage shunt , clinically significant laboratory abnormalities , any ongoing medical condition that would interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study , or treatment with another investigational drug within 1 month of screening . 
 patients with scoliosis were allowed to participate if , in the opinion of the investigator , a lumbar puncture could be performed safely . 
 a total of 3 lumbar punctures were scheduled during the 2 trials for drug delivery and/or follow - up collection of cerebrospinal fluid for safety and pharmacokinetic analyses . 
 drug was administered via intrathecal injection of a 5-ml bolus over 1 to 3 minutes . 
 the protocol recommended a 22- to 25-gauge spinal anesthesia needle ( 21-gauge needle allowed if participant s weight or condition dictated ) and that the lumbar punctures were performed at the l3-l4 disc space or 1 level above or 1 to 2 levels below , as needed . in all cases , 
 anesthesia and/or sedation and fluoroscopy or ultrasonography were permitted to facilitate the procedure and varied by institution at the discretion of the investigators at each site . 
 participants underwent the first lumbar puncture on day 1 for cerebrospinal fluid collection and nusinersen dosing , the second lumbar puncture on day 8 or day 29 for cerebrospinal fluid collection , and the third lumbar puncture during the extension study for cerebrospinal fluid collection and redosing with nusinersen 9 to 14 months after the initial lumbar puncture . in the phase 1 single - dose study , participants were initially monitored for safety and tolerability for 29 days ( 1-mg and 3-mg cohorts ) or 85 days ( 6-mg and 9-mg cohorts ) post dosing . 
 safety reporting included adverse events related to lumbar puncture , and a subgroup analysis was performed to compare reported lumbar puncture  related adverse events by needle size , participant age , and spinal muscular atrophy type .

 the phase 1 study was a first - in - human , open - label , escalating - dose study to assess the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of a single intrathecal dose ( 1 , 3 , 6 , or 9 mg ) of nusinersen in children with spinal muscular atrophy . 
 each dose cohort had 6 to 10 participants ( n = 28 ) . upon completion , 
 all participants had the opportunity to enroll in a subsequent extension study and receive additional dosing with nusinersen . 
 the methods and results of the phase 1 study and its extension are detailed elsewhere . 
 briefly , medically stable spinal muscular atrophy participants 2 to 14 years of age were enrolled in 4 sites in the united states ( boston children s hospital , boston , ma ; columbia university medical center , new york , ny ; ut southwestern medical center  children s medical center dallas , dallas , tx ; and university of utah school of medicine , salt lake city , ut ) . 
 eligible participants had to be able to complete all study procedures , meet age - appropriate institutional guidelines for lumbar puncture procedures , and have a life expectancy of > 2 years . 
 participants were excluded for serious respiratory insufficiency , hospitalization for surgery or pulmonary event within the past 2 months , active infection at screening , history of brain or spinal cord disease or bacterial meningitis , presence of implanted cerebrospinal fluid drainage shunt , clinically significant laboratory abnormalities , any ongoing medical condition that would interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study , or treatment with another investigational drug within 1 month of screening . 
 patients with scoliosis were allowed to participate if , in the opinion of the investigator , a lumbar puncture could be performed safely . 
 a total of 3 lumbar punctures were scheduled during the 2 trials for drug delivery and/or follow - up collection of cerebrospinal fluid for safety and pharmacokinetic analyses . 
 drug was administered via intrathecal injection of a 5-ml bolus over 1 to 3 minutes . 
 the protocol recommended a 22- to 25-gauge spinal anesthesia needle ( 21-gauge needle allowed if participant s weight or condition dictated ) and that the lumbar punctures were performed at the l3-l4 disc space or 1 level above or 1 to 2 levels below , as needed . in all cases , 
 anesthesia and/or sedation and fluoroscopy or ultrasonography were permitted to facilitate the procedure and varied by institution at the discretion of the investigators at each site . 
 participants underwent the first lumbar puncture on day 1 for cerebrospinal fluid collection and nusinersen dosing , the second lumbar puncture on day 8 or day 29 for cerebrospinal fluid collection , and the third lumbar puncture during the extension study for cerebrospinal fluid collection and redosing with nusinersen 9 to 14 months after the initial lumbar puncture . 
 in the phase 1 single - dose study , participants were initially monitored for safety and tolerability for 29 days ( 1-mg and 3-mg cohorts ) or 85 days ( 6-mg and 9-mg cohorts ) post dosing . 
 safety reporting included adverse events related to lumbar puncture , and a subgroup analysis was performed to compare reported lumbar puncture  related adverse events by needle size , participant age , and spinal muscular atrophy type . 
 a total of 28 children were enrolled and received dosing in the phase 1 study ; 15 children had spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 13 had spinal muscular atrophy type 3 ( table 1 ) . at baseline , 
 participant mean ( range ) age was 6.1 ( 2.0 - 14.0 ) years , 17 were female , 10 were ambulatory , and 13 had scoliosis . 
 one child had vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rods inserted and the pedicle screws were inserted into t2 , t3 , and t4 with fixation of the growing rods to the pelvis , leaving the lumbar spine area spared . 
 the first and second lumbar punctures were performed on 28 and 27 children in the parent study , respectively , and the third on 18 children who re - enrolled in the extension study . 
 of the 10 children not re - enrolling , 6 re - enrolled in a multiple - dose study of nusinersen and 4 decided not to enroll . 
 of these , 1 child did not re - enroll for reasons related to the lumbar puncture procedure . 
 this was a 12-year - old girl with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 who had severe scoliosis at baseline and in whom the second fluoroscopically guided lumbar puncture procedure was not performed successfully at day 8 in the phase 1 study . 
 participants were enrolled and treated in 4 sites ; the institutional lumbar puncture procedures used in each site are reported in table 2 . 
 both cutting - tip and atraumatic ( pencil - point ) spinal needles were used and the general practice was to perform the procedure in the lateral decubitus or prone position by pediatric anesthesiologists , neurologists , or neuroradiologists in either inpatient or outpatient settings . 
 all sites performed the procedure under intravenous ( midazolam , ketamine , fentanyl , remifentanil , and/or propofol ) or inhaled anesthesia / sedation ( sevoflurane and/or nitrous oxide ) . 
 some sites also reported the use of topical anesthesia ( emla cream ) or locally injected lidocaine ( table 2 ) .

 the majority of lumbar punctures were carried out using either a 22- ( 48% ) or 25-gauge ( 37% ) needle inserted in the l3-l4 ( 44% ) or l4-l5 ( 29% ) space 
 . nearly half ( 44% ) of the lumbar punctures were guided using fluoroscopy ( table 3 ) . 
 participants were treated for post  lumbar puncture headache with acetaminophen , ibuprofen , and/or caffeine citrate . 
 of the 73 lumbar punctures performed , the majority ( n = 50 ; 68% ) had no complications ; lumbar puncture  related adverse events were reported in 23 ( 32% ; table 4 ) . 
 the most common adverse events were headache ( 9 events ) , back pain ( 9 events ) , and post  lumbar puncture syndrome ( 8 events ; post  dural puncture headache with or without vomiting ) , and all events resolved without long - term complications . 
 the timing of the adverse events varied ; 67% ( n = 6 ) of the headaches occurred 12 to 72 hours post lumbar puncture , whereas back pain was reported 0 to 48 hours post procedure ( figure 1 ) . 
 fifty percent ( n = 4 ) of the post  lumbar puncture syndrome events occurred between 12 and 48 hours , with the remaining occurring after 72 hours ( figure 1 ) . 
 all 8 incidences of post  lumbar puncture syndrome were managed with acetaminophen , ibuprofen , and/or caffeine citrate for headache . 
 all 8 cases of post  lumbar puncture syndrome resolved with conservative therapy , and none of the 7 participants needed an epidural blood patch . in 1 case , 
 a blood patch was performed prophylactically during the second lumbar puncture procedure in a patient who had experienced a post  dural puncture headache following the first procedure . 
 resolution of the post  lumbar puncture syndrome occurred between 4 hours and 5 days , with the majority of the events ( 50% of cases ) lasting 1 to 2 days . 
 participants reporting > 1 adverse event after each lumbar puncture were counted only once for the lumbar puncture . 
 time of onset of headache , back pain , and post  lumbar puncture syndrome . 
 most common lumbar puncture  associated adverse events ( n = 73 ) and their time of onset are shown . 
 a subgroup analysis compared lumbar puncture complications with needle size , participant age , and spinal muscular atrophy type and demonstrated that headache , back pain , and post  lumbar puncture syndrome were observed more frequently when a 21- or 22-gauge needle was used , in older children ( 8 - 14 years of age ) , and in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3 ( table 5 ) . 
 lumbar puncture  related adverse events are well documented in children and infants , with the most common complications being back pain and headache with an incidence of 11% to 40% and 12% to 33% , respectively . although the incidence of post  lumbar puncture syndrome in children is not well reported , 4% to 11% of the reported headaches are classified as post  dural puncture headaches . 
 in addition to headache , post  lumbar puncture syndrome can also include transient effects of backache , dizziness , nausea with or without vomiting , numbness , and lower extremity weakness . in rare cases , 
 more severe symptoms have been reported , such as intracranial hypotension , epidural hematoma , and cauda equina syndrome . in this phase 1 study and its extension , 
 73 lumbar punctures were performed for cerebrospinal fluid collection and/or intrathecal drug administration in children with spinal muscular atrophy . 
 approximately one - third of the procedures were associated with adverse events , most commonly with headache , back pain , and post  lumbar puncture syndrome , and the majority occurred within 72 hours after the procedure . 
 a subgroup analysis demonstrated that the highest incidence of adverse events was reported in older children , children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3 , and when a larger 21- or 22-gauge needle was used . using a 24-gauge needle or smaller atraumatic needle inserted with the 
 bevel parallel to the dura fibers had been suggested to considerably reduce damage to the dura and consequently decrease the risk for cerebrospinal fluid leak after lumbar puncture , including in children . 
 needle type ( atraumatic or traumatic ) may have a greater impact on the reported incidence of post  dural puncture headache than needle size . 
 turnbull et al found the incidence of post  dural puncture headache varied from 0.6% to 4% ( 22 gauge ) and 0% to 14.5% ( 25 gauge ) with an atraumatic ( whitacre ) needle versus 36% ( 22 gauge ) and 3% to 25% ( 25-gauge ) with a traumatic cutting - tip ( quincke ) needle , respectively . 
 although using an atraumatic needle may reduce the incidence of post  lumbar puncture syndrome , some studies have identified increased failure rate and paresthesia when using an atraumatic needle versus a cutting - tip spinal needle . 
 nearly half of the lumbar punctures were successfully carried out in children with spinal muscular atrophy using a 24-gauge spinal needle or smaller and , consequently , were associated with reduced incidence of headache and post  lumbar puncture syndrome compared with procedures performed using a 21- or 22-gauge needle . 
 after initial experiences , all investigational sites switched to using a smaller needle size , except when use of a larger needle size was required ( eg , scoliosis ) 
 . the higher incidence of adverse events , particularly headaches , observed among older children and/or in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3 were likely related to the use of larger bore / gauge spinal needles , cutting - tip needles ( eg , quincke type ) , multiple attempts , and/or due to technical difficulties resulting from increased body weight and the presence of scoliosis or excessive lumbar lordosis . in most cases , post 
 dural puncture headache can be successfully treated with conservative therapy , consisting of bed rest in prone or lateral position , hydration , oral or intravenous caffeine , anti - nausea or antiemetic therapy , and/or analgesics . 
 however , in children with post  dural puncture headaches persisting > 48 hours or that worsen despite the use of conservative therapy , a therapeutic epidural blood patch may be indicated . 
 although there is conflicting evidence , some studies also support the use of a prophylactic blood patch to prevent post 
 dural puncture headache ; however , none of these studies included children . in this study , all post  dural puncture headaches resolved with conservative treatment of bed rest , adequate hydration , and administration of caffeine and other analgesics , and therapeutic epidural blood patches proved unnecessary . other considerations that may facilitate lumbar puncture success in children include patient positioning and the use of spinal ultrasound . 
 few studies in children and infants have compared the feasibility of lumbar puncture in upright versus lateral recumbent position . both the seated and lateral decubitus position with hip flexion increased the interspinous space compared with hip neutral positions and may increase lumbar puncture success rate . 
 the use of spinal ultrasound may facilitate the lumbar puncture procedure , and is favored over fluoroscopy in children , particularly if repeated procedures are planned , to minimize radiation exposure and cost . in this study , 
 lumbar punctures were performed in the lateral decubitus or prone position , and nearly half of the lumbar punctures were successfully done without ultrasound and/or fluoroscopy . however , in patients with spinal muscular atrophy with scoliosis , spinal rods , or other hardware , the use of imaging may be warranted to facilitate the procedure and increase the success of intrathecal medication delivery . 
 lumbar punctures were successfully performed in the participants with scoliosis ( 13 in the first procedure , 12 in the second procedure , and 11 in the third procedure ) and in the one child who had spinal rods . 
 the second fluoroscopy - guided procedure was unsuccessful in only 1 patient because of scoliosis . 
 this suggests that in some cases scoliosis might hinder lumbar puncture success in children with spinal muscular atrophy , but the frequency needs to be confirmed in larger studies . 
 general anesthesia and/or sedation are routinely performed in children to reduce procedure - related anxiety , pain , and distress , and to increase the overall success rate of lumbar puncture . however , increasing concerns about the impact of repeated anesthesia exposure on the developing nervous system in infants and young children must be carefully considered when repeated procedures are planned . 
 all 73 lumbar punctures performed in this study were performed using either intravenous ( midazolam , ketamine , fentanyl , remifentanil , and/or propofol ) or inhaled anesthesia / sedation ( sevoflurane , nitrous oxide ) , with no associated complications reported . 
 children with spinal muscular atrophy who have moderate to severe muscle weakness and/or severe scoliosis are at higher risk for hypoventilation and respiratory compromise . 
 thus , if deep sedation or general anesthesia is used , assisted ventilation may be required by either non - invasive or invasive means . 
 the use of local topical or subcutaneous anesthesia may help decrease the requirements for sedation . 
 based on our experience in this study , we recommend the most minimal use of sedative medications or anesthesia to permit safe and effective completion of the procedure . 
 the limitations of this study include a small sample size and the limited number of lumbar puncture procedures performed . 
 further experiences with lumbar puncture in children and infants with spinal muscular atrophy are needed to add to this knowledge . 
 in summary , repeated lumbar punctures were successfully performed in children with spinal muscular atrophy in the initial nusinersen clinical studies . 
 the frequency of lumbar puncture  related adverse events in children with spinal muscular atrophy was similar to that previously reported in children and infants , and were mainly limited to headache , back pain , and post  lumbar puncture syndrome . a 24-gauge needle or smaller was successfully used in children with spinal muscular atrophy to perform lumbar puncture with lower incidence of complications , suggesting that using a 24-gauge or smaller needle would likely reduce the chance of adverse events . bed rest , 
 adequate hydration , oral caffeine , and/or analgesics were sufficient to resolve post  lumbar puncture headache / syndrome without the need of a therapeutic blood patch in all patients . provisions for ultrasound guidance may be warranted in future research protocols given the potential benefit of reduced radiation exposure compared to fluoroscopy , especially in cases of serial procedures for repeated drug delivery . 
 overall , we conclude that intrathecal delivery of medication is feasible , safe , and well tolerated . 
 our experience may prove useful for guiding the development of best practice strategies for safe and effective intrathecal delivery of nusinersen and/or other promising emerging therapies for spinal muscular atrophy .","nusinersen ( isis - smnrx or isis 396443 ) is an antisense oligonucleotide drug administered intrathecally to treat spinal muscular atrophy . 
 we summarize lumbar puncture experience in children with spinal muscular atrophy during a phase 1 open - label study of nusinersen and its extension . during the studies , 
 73 lumbar punctures were performed in 28 patients 2 to 14 years of age with type 2/3 spinal muscular atrophy . 
 no complications occurred in 50 ( 68% ) lumbar punctures ; in 23 ( 32% ) procedures , adverse events were attributed to lumbar puncture . 
 most common adverse events were headache ( n = 9 ) , back pain ( n = 9 ) , and post  lumbar puncture syndrome ( n = 8) . in a subgroup analysis , adverse events were more frequent in older children , children with type 3 spinal muscular atrophy , and with a 21- or 22-gauge needle compared to a 24-gauge needle or smaller . 
 lumbar punctures were successfully performed in children with spinal muscular atrophy ; lumbar puncture  related adverse event frequency was similar to that previously reported in children .",pubmed
"the main concern is to ensure the highest possible standard for the services provided and to meet the needs of individual service users and communities ( 1 ) . in 1997 , 
 the uk department of health introduced clinical governance ( cg ) as a strategy for improving quality of health care services ( 2 ) . 
 the classic definition of cg is provided by scally and donaldson as  a system through which [ health ] organizations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish  ( 2 , 3 ) . 
 the iranian ministry of health and medical education ( mohme ) has applied cg as a framework for improving quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009 . 
 mohme used the definition cited above as a guide to implement the policy . the cg model developed in iran 
 consists of seven interlocking components including : clinical effectiveness , clinical audit , risk management , patient and public involvement , education and training , staff and staff management , and use of information ( 4 ) . 
 systems awareness , leadership , ownership , teamwork , and communication are considered as a foundation of this model . 
 mohme required curative deputy of medical universities and hospital managers to work together to implement such initiatives in iranian hospitals . 
 the deputies for curative affairs in each medical university have the role of leadership in planning , implementing , monitoring and following up ministry of health policies particularly in quality improvement programs including cg ( 5 ) . 
 a number of studies have assessed the implementation of cg in different health systems and health care settings ( 611 ) . 
 insufficient knowledge and attitude toward cg , lack of resources , inadequate information technology systems , resistance to change , necessity of cultural change and professional boundaries were the main factors explored by lathman et al . 
 another study using qualitative research identified some barriers such as speed of cg implementation , workload and earmarked funding in cg implementation ( 7 ) . 
 ( 2002 ) considered lack of adequate senior management support as well as resources , structural and cultural issues as obstacles ( 8) . 
 the scarcity of resources was one of the most important barriers in implementation of cg noted by walsh et al . 
 a number of factors were identified which ultimately could affect the success of quality improvement activities . raising awareness of cg among managers , supportive culture and sufficient resources 
 declared that state level accountability in clinical governance implementation could be addressed by allocating proper resources and empowering policy implementers with proper performance control system ( 11 ) . 
 previous literatures mainly provide inadequate understanding about senior managers viewpoint toward facilitators and barriers in implementation of cg . in the current study an effort was done to capture both facilitators and barriers in cg implementation from the viewpoint of curative deputies in iranian medical universities . 
 to obtain a comprehensive understanding about senior managers viewpoint toward cg barriers and facilitators , a qualitative research was employed . 
 to do so , two main information sources were used : face to face interviews and relevant document reviews . 
 deputies for curative affairs of all types of iranian medical universities were purposefully selected to maximize the sample diversity and provide a comprehensive view toward cg implementation . the sampling continued until reaching data saturation . finally , forty three deputies were interviewed . in the first step , 
 an interview topic guide was developed on the basis of findings of literature review and expert opinions ( table 1 ) . 
 it covered the concept of clinical governance , key factors relating to clinical governance implementation process , facilitators and barriers that hospitals were experiencing . 
 some relevant documents were also analyzed such as cg annual reports , audit reports and minutes of meetings . 
 the qualitative thematic framework analysis was used to analyze the data with the assistance of the atlas - ti , qualitative data analysis software . 
 data analysis process includes five stages : familiarization , developing a thematic framework , indexing , charting , and mapping and interpretation ( 12 ) . to increase the validity , 
 it helped to ensure that the findings were congruent with participants perceptions , beliefs and opinions ( 13 ) . 
 the five main themes were explored and presented according with their sub - themes in ( table 2 ) . 
 most senior managers accepted that improving quality of health care should be integral to their role and essential to safeguard patient care . 
 they believed that quality improvement is a strategic goal , to achieve central government targets . 
 the findings demonstrated the willingness to support and positive attitude towards clinical governance .. senior managers also declared that having adequate knowledge about clinical governance also positive attitude toward the necessity of the program are the main factors affecting clinical governance implementation . 
 the level of enthusiasm expressed by senior managers seemed to be related in particular to their knowledge and attitude about cg concept and components . 
 those managers who had gained such knowledge were more optimistic toward success of the program . 
 continuous training about clinical governance concept and principles can make a positive attitude toward the program  . 
 main themes of senior managers viewpoint toward cg barriers and facilitators it was stated that such quality improvement program may facilitates the development of a culture focusing on continuous improvement . 
 most interviewees declared that appropriate culture for improving quality in the organization ; team work and readiness toward change are the main factors which influence cg implementation . 
 culture of openness in which staffs are willing to bring ideas related to service quality development was the other important factor mentioned by participants . 
 it was believed that culture which promotes alignment of clinical governance goals at both managerial and staff level should be developed . 
 they also stated that clinical governance components needed to be embedded in day to day work .  at first , we should culturalise cg in our work place  . 
 interviewees believed that adequate organizational commitment toward clinical governance should be created in order to increase the likelihood of program progress . 
 when continuous meetings are hold in high managerial levels of medical university about reporting our progress in implementing cg , it makes me sure that there is an organizational commitment .  effective organizational interactions both within and between departments was the other organizational key factor highlighted by senior managers . 
 they emphasized that clinical governance activities would be more effective if all departments in organization accept the importance of cg and participate in the implementation process .  everywhere in our organization you can see something about cg definition , process , implementation and so on . 
 they stated that most of staff working in this program does not have official position in the organizational chart which negatively affects their work . 
 they suggested that creation of such position can guarantee stability and legitimacy of staff in their workplace and have positive effect . 
 senior managers accepted that allocating adequate staff to undertake the responsibilities required by program had a critical role in pushing forward the program . 
 the other important factor recognized as an organizational factor was the necessity for development and dissemination of national standards . 
 interviewees believe that establishment of such standards and presence of guidelines is prerequisites of such huge quality improvement program . 
 in addition , it can help to conduct evaluation against determined standards which shows gaps in delivery of services . 
 one of the factors was managerial commitment toward clinical governance and their executive ability in implementing the program . 
 most of senior managers mentioned themselves ultimately accountable for clinical activities and quality of care in their organization . 
 they also believed that successful outcome of quality activities depends on managers participation in quality procedures and the level of their commitment . 
 interviewees added that senior managers themselves should demonstrate executive capabilities in order to motivate departments to implement clinical governance principles , provide adequate resources , facilitate staff training and remove any obstacle in the way . 
 i feel positive about the future of clinical governance because of my involvement with the program  . 
 furthermore , managers should use appropriate incentive mechanisms to sustain staff motivation and participation . 
 the matter is that how top managers will motivate us in implementing quality programs besides doing our regular organizational task . 
 interviewees highlighted that stability in managerial and executive positions is crucial to maintain the consistency and continuity of the program . 
 such unnecessary managerial position changes not only waste money and reduce the program progress , but also , ruin the managers motivation . 
 major changes in top managerial positions threaten the stability of cg and other quality improvement programs . 
 most of the senior managers agreed that shortage of staff and limited dedicated resources to implement clinical governance were main barriers in implementing clinical governance . 
 they believed that such barriers leave many managers feel beleaguered and faced with problems to effectively perform the program . 
 i think a major challenge in implementation of cg is lack of resources especially staff and money . 
 senior managers mostly emphasized that fostering a sense of engagement among medical staff especially physicians is important . 
 one of the reasons for resistance was that the staff is overwhelmed by high workload and different responsibilities . 
 they are seeing the program as being imposed and as policing their performance , rather than supporting quality improvement . 
 there is somehow resistance to clinical governance among some physicians and medical staff which i think it is because they are overwhelmed with the responsibilities they have regarding to care giving  . 
 some managers had a concern that this program might be temporary and act as a wave . 
 in addition some issues such as lack of support from physicians and medical staff , legal challenges , parallel quality improvement models running in the hospitals , increased workload , parallel functions in different domains of curative deputy and inadequate supporting systems developed for the staff in the way of clinical governance implementation were mentioned as barriers . 
 much of work i perform on clinical governance is done on my own limited time competing with other activities on my time . 
 i have lots of responsibilities to undertake and this encounters me with lack of time  . 
 some activities were also addressed by senior managers in order to mitigate problems in five afore - mentioned domains .

 some activities were also addressed by senior managers in order to mitigate problems in five afore - mentioned domains . 
 in the present study , we tried to explore senior managers viewpoint about the facilitators and barriers in cg implementation . 
 we found that sufficient knowledge and clear understanding about the principles and practice of cg have major roles in achieving desired improvement in service quality and patient safety in health care settings . 
 this study has also highlighted the importance of supporting culture , appropriate organizational structure and managerial commitment as perceived facilitators in cg implementation . 
 there was also a strongly accepted view that staff at all levels should be consulted , involved in planning and implementation of cg programs . 
 the main identified obstacles were lack of adequate managerial support as well as resource , structural and cultural issues and professional boundaries . 
 our results are parallel with the findings of many other studies . a model developed by o brien et al 
 the model outlines four dimensions in successfully implementation of clinical governance : cultural , technical , structural and strategic . 
 the cultural dimension related to beliefs , values , norms and behaviors in the organization which either suppress or support quality improvement activities . 
 an organization with strong and clear vision and goals , stable managerial leadership , supportive structures for team work , effective interactions and inter professional relationships and continuous learning culture is more likely to successfully implement clinical governance ( 14 ) . in our study 
 it is clear that senior managers perception about the important factors in implementing clinical governance were classified in five main domains . 
 the domains were knowledge and attitude , culture , organizational factors , managerial factors and barriers . 
 most of the senior managers believed in knowledge and attitude toward clinical governance and culture as the most important factors in cg implementation . 
 this was thought to be a major factor in achieving improvement in service quality and patient safety mentioning in another study . 
 similar to o brien study , our findings showed that culture is also an important factor and many organizations expend much effort to shape their culture in a way to improve quality . 
 a sense of ownership toward quality improvement and a positive attitude to contribute new ideas also provide an organizational climate necessary to allow alignment of attitudes and values with a continuous quality improvement . in hogan study about 
 consultants attitudes to clinical governance  , quality improvement was considered as an integral part of consultants role and they accepted that maintaining service standards , monitoring and improving outcomes for patients were activities they should undertake . 
 there was also recognition about the importance of team based approaches to quality improvement ( 15 ) . 
 this supports the findings of our study which focuses on the importance of being involved in quality improvement activities by all staff especially physicians and medical staff . 
 these include structures and processes with clear vision and goals toward quality improvement , involving staff in the process of change , rewarding positive behaviors , improving the effectiveness of communication across the organization and providing opportunity for team work . 
 campbell study on  the role of cg as a strategy for quality improvement in primary care  found significant barriers in the way of cg implementation . 
 these included in appropriate culture , too few staff , limited resources , disengagement by some practices and staff , lack of time to perform quality activities ( 8) . our study supported the above findings and declared that some senior managers felt powerless with the volume of work and shortage of resources . 
 meaningful engagement and commitment at all levels of managers and staff has been highlighted as a major factor in implementing cg . 
 the managerial level needed to match its commitment to a program of change with realistic timetables to secure the cultural and organizational changes needed to improve quality of care . the need for top management support is the most frequently cited imperative for success of any program . 
 wilkinson and witcher in an examination of factors important in successfully implementation of clinical governance stressed on the importance of quality committed senior managers and staff effectively involved in all levels of organization ( 16 ) . 
 fenton o creevy suggests that the most consistently barrier to the success of every quality improvement program is resistance from managers ( 17 ) . 
 dawson found that one of the major problems encountered in implementing quality program is lack of commitment at the middle and supervisory management . 
 they suggest that many of the problems of survivor syndrome arise from the breakdown of traditional psychological contract where managers promised job security ( 18 ) . in our study , the necessity of physicians and medical staff participation in clinical governance program has been emphasized . 
 lawler , mohrman and ledford have demonstrated the close relationship between success of quality programs and employee involvement initiatives ( 19 ) . 
 another issue is the importance of having an employee recognition and rewards system with supporting mechanisms providing adequate salaries for the staff being involved in the implementation of clinical governance program . 
 encouraging workers to become involved in continuous improvement activities is relatively an important factor ( 20 ) . 
 wilkins and witcher suggest that employees who are highly skilled , with adequate salaries and incentives are typically more likely to accept the program ( 16 ) . 
 master produced a list of eight barriers in the way of implementing a quality improvement program includinglack of management commitment , lack of training , inability to adopt organizational culture suitable for quality improvement , lack of employee involvement , lack of resources , improper planning , in compatible organizational structure and inadequate use of team work ( 21 ) . 
 he declares that quality improvement activities , team work , effective communication and supporting the quality program in all organizational levels are of great importance ( 22 ) . 
 sohal , samson and ramsay also investigated the barriers of successful implementation of quality plan from the viewpoint of organizational management . 
 they categorized the barriers in a number of groups : organizational culture ( top management support and effective involvement , changing values and culture to align with quality improvement requirements ) , strategic planning issues ( lack of planning for quality , inappropriate organizational structural ) , resource management issues ( lack of resources , inadequate number of personnel and additions to normal working load ) ( 23 ) . 
 another study conducted by terziovski , sohal and moss showed that a successful quality organization would include the following characteristics : managers and staff with positive attitude toward quality , employment of quality management practices , dissemination of responsibility of quality to all staff at all levels , , leadership commitment , having strategic planning , providing adequate resources , focusing on training and adoption of appropriate culture ( 24 ) . in our study , senior managers stated some recommendations for implementing clinical governance more effectively such as : creating a suitable culture for implementing quality programs , evaluating the quality of organization , determining the existing deficiencies , setting up appropriate strategic and functional plan to achieve determined objectives , following the programs , evaluating the results and encouraging quality improvement activities continuously ( table 3 ) . 
 the interviews reflect only top managerial perspectives at medical university level and not managers working in hospitals who should play important role in cg implementation . 
 in addition , due to the nature of qualitative studies the results can not be generalized although we are looking for theoretical generalization . 
 although this study has provided the first evaluation of senior managers viewpoint about facilitators and barriers in cg implementation in iran , further research is required to track the progress of the cg policy as it unfolds over time . 
 this qualitative paper explores main facilitators and barriers perceived by deputies in curative affairs of iranian medical universities . 
 identifying facilitators and barriers from the viewpoint of senior managers can have an effective role in successful progress of cg program . 
 the reason is that these managers are directly responsible for piloting such quality programs and are the most familiar with challenges existing in the way of implementing cg . 
 the authors conclude that one of the possible solutions is developing educational courses and workshops with the purpose of raising staff awareness toward cg concept and practice . developing a supportive culture , having all levels of staff commitment and involvement , effective communication , developing clinical guidelines , 
 using incentive tools and overcoming legal challenges are other resolutions mentioned in this regard . by successfully implementing the program , patients will benefit from quality services . 
 also health professionals take an advantage of working in a safer and more supportive system . 
 evidence suggests that governance needs to match its commitment to a program of change with realistic timetables to secure the cultural and organizational changes needed to improve quality of care . 
 ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors .","abstractbackgroundhealth care systems should assign quality improvement as their main mission . clinical governance ( cg ) 
 is a key strategy to improve quality of health care services . 
 the iranian ministry of health and medical education ( mohme ) has promoted cg as a framework for safeguarding quality and safety in all hospitals since 2009 . 
 the purpose of this study was to explore perceived facilitators and barriers to implementing cg by deputies for curative affairs of iranian medical universities.methodsa qualitative study was conducted using face to face interviews with a purposeful sample of 43 deputies for curative affairs of iranian medical universities and documents review .

 pe rceived barriers were the reverse of facilitators noted above in addition to insufficient resources , legal challenges , workload and parallel quality programs.conclusionssuccessful implementation of cg in iran will require identifying barriers and challenges existing in the way of cg implementation and try to mitigate them by using appropriate facilitators .",pubmed
"hydatid cyst disease is one of the most important zoonotic diseases , which occur , in larval stage of echinococcus granulosus parasite . in this disease , 
 canines such as dog , wolf , fox , and jackal ( the final host ) are infected by eating contaminated viscera , and small adult worms with size of 27 mm are formed in their intestines and begin to spawn . 
 canines repel the eggs of adult worms along with feces and infect the soil , water , and vegetables . 
 herbivores as the main intermediate host are infected by eating forage contaminated with the larvae of this parasite . besides , human as the intermediate host 
 is infected accidentally either by eating contaminated water and vegetables , or direct contact with contaminated dogs is infected to parasite egg of this disease ; and hydatid cyst is usually involved the lung and liver in human ( 1 , 2 ) . epidemiological , clinical , and pathological symptoms of this disease depend on some factors such as age , gender , infection severity , cyst size , and the involved organ in the body ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 this disease is common in most parts of the world especially in countries where animal husbandry is current . 
 contamination to this parasite is spreading in most tropical regions of the world and it is globally distributed in many countries such as argentina , peru , east africa , central asia , china , and south america ( 3 ) . in endemic regions , the incidence rate of disease can be reached over 50 per 100,000 person - years with the prevalence rate of 5%10% in human ( 3 , 4 ) . on the other hand , hydatidosis is among the most important human diseases with the high health and economic burden ( 5 , 6 ) . 
 iran is one of the areas that has been considered as hyper - endemic area by who in terms of close relationship of a high proportion of society with animals , traditional animal husbandry , and then contact with the sources of infection ( 7 , 8) . 
 the prevalence rate of this disease in the intermediate host has reported as 11.5%34.6% ( 9 ) , and the prevalence rate of human hydatid cyst has been reported from 1.1% to 13.7% in different parts of iran ( 1012 ) . 
 assessment of the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease can help health policy - makers to focus on the main public health problems in the community and to assess the efficacy of control and preventive programs to limit the spread and transmission of the parasite in humans . 
 hence , the present study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical status of human hydatidosis in khorasan razavi province during 201114 . 
 this cross - sectional study was conducted in khorasan razavi province , the northeast of iran , in 2014 . 
 the study population was all cases with hydatid cyst who diagnosed in governmental and private laboratories , hospitals and health centers in khorasan razavi province during 201114 . 
 the data collection was performed using a checklist including age , sex , nationality , place of residence , occupation , infected organ , the number of cysts , the type of diagnosis ( ct scan , mri , radiology , sonography , immunofluorescence , other ) , clinical symptom , and having risk factors such as how to wash vegetables and contact with dog . 
 descriptive statistics including frequency tables and diagrams as well as analytical statistics including chi square and t - student tests were used for data analysis . 
 all statistical analyses were performed at 0.05 significance levels using stata software , version 12 ( stata corp , college station , tx , usa ) . 
 in addition , mapping the percentage of hydatid cyst cases was created using gis software by cities . for considering ethical issues in data collection 
 , it should be noted that all information of the patients has been confidential and the information has been recorded with code and without mentioning name . 
 in total , 357 hydatid cyst cases had been registered in the health centers during the periods 201114 in all parts of province . 
 the most percentage of cases was related to the cities mashhad ( 51.8% ) , ghoochan ( 7.8% ) , neishabour ( 7.0% ) , and fariman ( 4.8% ) , respectively . 
 percentage of hydatid cyst cases by county in khorasan razavi province in 201114 demographic characteristics of studied patients by sex are shown in table 1 . 
 of 357 cases , 54.9% were women , 40.3% rural , 45.8% housewives , and 3.4% were afghan . 
 the mean age of women was higher than that of men ( 39.1318.9 compared to 34.717.9 , respectively , p - value=0.025 ) . 
 demographic characteristics of patients with hydatid cyst by sex in khorasan razavi province in 201114 data are presented as number ( % ) . 
 the most common symptom of cases was related to the cities mashhad ( 51.8% ) , ghoochan ( 7.8% ) , neishabour ( 7.0% ) , and fariman ( 4.8% ) , respectively . moreover , 45.9% of patients had domestic dog and hygiene principles of washing the vegetables was adhered by 6.7% of patients and 64.4% were washed the vegetables with water alone ( table 2 ) . 
 risk factors of hydatid cysts in the patients in khorasan razavi province in 201114   the majority of patients ( 70.5% ) were infected with a single cyst , and 24.5% of them had multiple cysts . 
 one hundred fifty one ( 42.3% ) of patients were diagnosed by radiology method and 37.8% by ct scan method . 
 the most common clinical symptom in the hydatidosis patients was abdominal pain ( 42.3% ) , after that hepatomegaly ( 27.4% ) , chest pain ( 21.6% ) , and cough ( 8.7% ) were other common symptoms . 
 liver involvement was reported in 59.4% of patients , and 8.4% had multiple organ involvement ( fig . 
 2 ) . status of organ involvement in the patients with hydatid cysts in khorasan razavi province during 201114 
 previous studies conducted from different parts of iran found the annual incidence of 1.33 in hamadan ( 13 ) , and 0.54 in kermanshah ( 14 ) per 100,000 population . 
 in addition , the rate of infection varied from 1.79% in ardabil ( 11 ) to 13.8% in khozestan ( 12 ) . 
 our findings showed that the highest proportion of hydatidosis ( 39.2% ) in the age group of 2140 years old . according to some factors such as geographical region , culture , and workforce ; age can play an important role on the occurrence of the infection . in this 
 regard , previous studies have reported the highest proportion of hydatidosis in the different age groups . 
 for example , the age group of 6069 in isfahan ( 10 ) , 4049 year in ardabil ( 11 ) , and 3060 year in qom ( 15 ) . based on a review study , 
 the range of 2040 years old as the age group of the highest proportion has been reported ( 7 ) . 
 the findings of this study showed the most percentage of infection in women than men ( 54.9% compared with 45.1% , respectively ) . 
 this might be due to more contribution of women to agricultural and animal husbandry in this region . 
 the high frequency of the disease in women than men is consistent with the obtained results of other iranian studies ( 16 , 17 ) and other countries ( 18 , 19 ) . 
 however , some studies reported the higher rate of infection in men ( 10 , 11 , 15 ) . 
 moreover , as stated in the previous studies conducted in iran ( 7 , 20 ) , the housewives had the highest proportion of infection . 
 it may be due to the more likely to contact with the source of contamination especially vegetables contaminated to parasitic eggs . in our study , 
 for example , the most percentage of the province s population is urbanite and another might be a good - quality disease reporting . 
 there are conflicting results in this regard ; some studies reported the same result with our study ( 11 , 15 , 20 , 21 ) , and other reported inconsistent result ( 8 , 22 ) . 
 we found that abdominal pain was the main symptom with a proportion of 42.3% in the patients . 
 studies conducted in turkey ( 23 ) and iran ( 24 ) has reported a proportion of 77.6% and 66% for this symptom , respectively . in our study in line with previous reports 
 ( 24 , 25 ) , liver was the most common localization of hydatid cyst . 
 about 8.4% of the patients in this study had multiple organs involved and it was 12.3% in another study in iran ( 24 ) . 
 the common diagnosis methods of the disease were radiology ( 42.3% ) followed by ct scan ( 37.8% ) . in a study to determine the pattern of hydatid cyst during 200010 in tehran revealed that ultrasonography and ct scan were the most used imaging methods ( 24 ) . 
 our findings demonstrate that these methods are the available tools for detecting hydatid cyst in iran . 
 concerning risk factors of infection with hydatidosis , our results found that 45.9% of individuals were in contact with dog , 64.4% of them have washed the vegetables with the water alone and 6.7% have washed the vegetables by hygiene principles of washing . 
 consequently , focus of improvement in education level of the society could be better . in bulgaria ( 25 ) 90% of the affected children 
 the prevalence of human hydatidosis , as a most important neglected disease , should be considered by health policy - makers in public health domain . in addition 
 , educational programs to better recognition of the disease symptoms , and to identify the infection sources are needed in high risk group of population .","background : this study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical aspects of patients with hydatid cyst during 2011 to 2014.methods:this cross - sectional study was conducted in khorasan razavi province , the northeast of iran , from 2011 to 2014 .

"oral route is one of the most preferred routes of drug administration due to its safety , ease of administration , and acceptability by patients . 
 about 60% of conventional dosage forms are available as the oral solid dosage forms . the low bioavailability , longer onset of action , and dysphasia patients turned the manufacturer towards the parenterals and liquid dosage forms . 
 but the liquid dosage forms ( syrup , suspension , emulsion , etc . ) have the problem of accurate dosing and parenterals are painful drug delivery systems , so they result in patient incompliance . 
 the most popular oral dosage forms are tablets and capsules ; one major drawback of these dosage forms is the difficulty to swallow . drinking water plays an important role in the swallowing of oral dosage forms . 
 people experience inconvenience in swallowing tablet dosage forms when water is not available particularly in the case of traveling ( motion sickness ) and sudden episodes of coughing during the common cold , allergic condition , and bronchitis . under such circumstances , tablets that can rapidly dissolve or disintegrate in the oral cavity known as fast dissolving tablets have attracted a great deal of attention . fast dissolving tablets 
 are also known as mouth - dissolving tablets , orodispersible tablets , rapidmelts , and porous tablets . fast dissolving tablets 
 dissolve or disintegrate within 60 seconds when placed in the mouth without drinking water or chewing . 
 the active ingredients are absorbed through mucous membranes in the mouth and git and enter the blood stream . 
 but due to certain disadvantages like their physical solid form , psychological fear of swallowing , chewing , or chocking , friability of wafer like porous and low pressure moulded tablet , and expensive packaging cost of these dosage forms to protect them , a new technology was developed as orally dissolving strip . orally dissolving strips are the most advanced form of oral solid dosage form due to more flexibility and comfort . 
 it improves the efficacy of apis by dissolving within a minute in oral cavity after the contact with saliva without chewing and need of water for administration . 
 it gives quick absorption and instant bioavailability of drugs due to high blood flow and permeability of oral mucosa which is 41000 times greater than that of skin . 
 orally dissolving strips are useful in patients such as pediatrics , geriatrics , bedridden , and emetic patients and conditions such as sudden episodes of allergic attacks or coughing . 
 there is an increasing interest in the development of orally dissolving strips as an alternative to fast dissolving tablets , due to their faster dissolution rate , higher flexibility , and better patient compliance . 
 presently , research work on the use of orally dissolving strips as promising carriers for the delivery of multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients has emerged [ 611 ] . 
 marketed orally dissolving strips products have also become available including listerine , chloraseptic , triaminic , and multivitamins . 
 the backbone of an orally dissolving strip is generally formed of a plasticizer and film forming polymer or a mixture of polymers that provide the necessary elasticity and shape to the film . 
 examples of polymers that have been used in the formulation of orally dissolving strips include hydrocolloids or povidone k-90 , maltodextrin ( mdx ) , hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose ( hpmc - e15 , 5 ) , pectin , sodium alginate , or blends of polymers . 
 orally dissolving strips can be prepared using a solvent - casting , rolling , hot melt extrusion , or solid dispersion methods . 
 epileptic seizures can occur in nonepileptic patients subjected to a variety of stresses and stimuli . 
 epilepsy is a neurological disorder which requires quick management of seizures in order to avoid the risk of permanent brain damage . 
 management of epilepsy differs from the treatment of other diseased conditions in that a single epileptic attack has a major negative effect on quality of life . 
 clobazam is a newer 1 , 5-benzodiazepine derivative which is a well tolerated , safe , and very effective antiepileptic drug having a broad spectrum of antiepileptic activity and minimal side effects and being relatively inexpensive . 
 thus , to control the epileptic seizures in the shortest possible time , an attempt has been made to develop , evaluate , and optimize orally dissolving strips of clobazam with improved bioavailability and palatability . 
 clobazam is an ideal drug candidate for an orally dissolving strip formulation because of its indication in children and its low - dose requirement . 
 the formulation of clobazam as an orally dissolving strip , required to be placed on the patient 's tongue without swallowing for dose administration , would significantly facilitate dose administration , with subsequent improvement in patient compliance . 
 thus , the aim of this work was to design , characterize , and optimize orally dissolving strip of clobazam using two polymers : ssg ( disintegrant ) and pva ( film former ) . 
 a 3 factorial design was used to evaluate the influence of film forming polymer pva and disintegrating agent ssg on the film 's mechanical properties , disintegration time , and dissolution rate . 
 this study also assessed the in vivo performance and ivivc of the optimum formulation by administration to healthy rabbits . 
 sodium starch glycolate , peg-400 , and directly compressible mannitol were received from loba chemie pvt . 
 the pure drug clobazam and physical mixture of clobazam and polymers were mixed with ir grade kbr pellets in the ratio of 100  :  1 and corresponding pellets were prepared in a hydraulic press . 
 the pellets were scanned over a wave number range of 4000500  cm in using perkin emler spectrum 400usa , ftir instrument . 
 differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) analysis was undertaken to visualize the changes , if any , observed during the preparation of the orally dissolving strip using mettler toledo model dsc 821e instrument . 
 dsc of clobazam ( pure drug ) , physical blend of pva , clobazam and ssg ( polymer ) , and optimized film formulation f6 were carried out over a temperature range of 30 to 300c at a scanning rate of 5c / min . 
 solubility studies were carried out by taking   an excess amount of drug in 10  ml of different solvents and ph 6.8 buffers in conical flask , closed with aluminum foil and constantly agitated at room temperature for 24  hrs , using orbital shaking incubator ( remi instruments , c-24 bl , and mumbai , india ) . 
 further , the solutions were filtered and the amount of drug solubilised was estimated at a wave length of 232  nm by using systronics pc based double beam spectrophotometer 2202 , mumbai , india . the orally dissolving strips of clobazam using film forming polyvinyl acetate ( pva ) and peg 400 as plasticizer were prepared by solvent - casting method . 
 an aqueous solution of the polymer was prepared in warm distilled water and was kept aside for 4 hours for swelling of polymer . 
 clobazam was added to the aqueous polymeric solution after levigation with required volume of peg 400 . 
 this was followed by the addition of mannitol as a sweetener as well as a solubilizer and sodium starch glycolate as a superdisintegrant . 
 the solution was casted on a plastic petri dish and dried at room temperature for 24  hr . 
 the strip was carefully removed from the petri dish , checked for any imperfections , and cut into the required size ( 2  2  cm ) to deliver the equivalent dose of 5  mg per strip . 
 preliminary trials were undertaken for designing the orally dissolving strips where the effect of various concentrations of the film forming agent and superdisintegrants on the characteristics of the strips was noted . 
 in addition , the prepared strips were also checked for surface perfection , smoothness , and ease of removal from petri dish without rupturing , folding , or cracking . 
 a 3 full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables x1 ( pva ) and x2 ( ssg ) over the dependent variables like tensile strength ( n / cm ) , disintegration time ( sec ) , and in vitro drug release ( % ) as shown in design layout tables 1 and 2 . in this design 
 , two factors were evaluated each at three levels ( 1 , 0 , + 1 ) and all possible nine experimental batches were formulated . 
 composition of all nine possible combinations of orally dissolving strip of clobazam using 3 full factorial designs is shown in table 3 . 
 the data was subjected to contour and 3d response surface plot using design - expert software version 8.0.7.1 . 
 a multiple linear regression equation incorporating interactive and polynomial terms was used to calculate the response as follows : 
 ( 1)y = b0+b1x1+b2x2+b12x1x2+b11x12+b22x22 , 
 where y is the dependent , that is , response variable , namely , disintegration time , tensile strength , and in vitro drug release ; b0 is the arithmetic mean response of the nine runs ; and b1 and b2 are the estimated coefficients for the factors x1 and x2 , respectively . 
 the main effects ( x1 and x2 ) represent the average result of changing one factor at a time from its low to high value . the interaction term ( x1x2 ) shows how the response changes when two factors are simultaneously changed . 
 the polynomial equations can be used to draw conclusions after considering the magnitude of the coefficient and the mathematical sign it carries ( i.e. , positive or negative ) . 
 the high values of the correlation coefficients for the dependent variables indicate a good fit . 
 the thickness of each strip was measured at five different locations ( centre and four corners ) using calibrated digital vernier caliper ( mituotoyo , japan ) . 
 a strip of ( 2  2  cm ) was cut and repeatedly folded at the same place till it broke . 
 the number of times the strip could be folded at the same place without breaking was taken as a measure of folding endurance . 
 the oral strip of size 4  cm was dissolved in 10  ml of phosphate buffer ph 6.8 and solution was filtered and drug content was estimated at 232  nm using double beam uv / visible spectrophotometer ( systronics 2202 , mumbai , india ) . 
 the experiments were carried out in triplicate for the strips of all formulations and average values were recorded . 
 the surface ph of orally dissolving strips was determined in order to investigate the possibility of any side effects in vivo . as 
 an acidic or alkaline ph may cause irritation to the oral mucosa , it is determined to keep the surface ph as close to neutral as possible . 
 the ph was measured by bringing the electrode in contact with the surface of the oral strip . 
 this study was performed on three strips of each formulation and mean  sd calculated . 
 in vitro disintegration time 
 was measured by placing the film ( 2  2  cm ) on stainless steel wire mesh placed in a petri dish containing 10  ml of phosphate buffer ph 6.8 . 
 time required for the oral strip to break was noted as in vitro disintegration time . 
 the test was performed on three strips of each formulation batch and mean  sd was calculated . 
 in vitro dissolution test 
 was performed according to the usp type ii paddle apparatus ( labindia ds 8000 , mumbai , india ) . 
 test was performed by fixing the oral strip ( 2  2  cm ) to rectangular glass plates so as to prevent it from floating and it was placed at the bottom of dissolution vessel containing 900  ml of phosphate buffer ph 6.8 at 37c with a rotation speed of 50  rpm . 
 a 5  ml of sample was taken at time intervals from 1 to 30  min , and the same volume was replenished with fresh buffer solution maintained at 37c . 
 the samples were filtered and analyzed at 232  nm using double beam uv / visible spectrophotometer ( systronics 2202 , mumbai , india ) ; the content of drug was calculated using equation generated from standard calibration curve of clobazam . 
 the release mechanism of clobazam from oral strip was also determined by fitting the release data to different kinetic models , zero order , first order , and higuchi . 
 the surface morphology of the optimized orally dissolving strip formulation was observed with scanning electron microscope ( hitachi s-3400n type ii model , japan ) . 
 pictures were taken at an excitation voltage of 1.0  kv and a magnification of 1000x . 
 films were cut into 2  2  cm square strips ( 4  cm ) . 
 the moisture uptake by the strip ( n = 3 ) was determined by exposing them to an environment of 75% relative humidity ( rh ) at room temperature ( 25  2c ) for 1 week [ 26 , 27 ] . 
 the uptake of moisture by the strips was measured and calculated as percent increase in weight . 
 tensile strength testing was determined at central institute of post harvesting engineering and technology ( ciphet ) , ludhiana , india , using a texture analyzer tahdi ( stable microsystem ) , equipped with a 5  kg load cell . 
 the strip was cut into 100  12.5  mm strips and equilibrated at 25c for 1 week . 
 initial grip separation was 60  mm and crosshead speed was 50  mm  min . 
 tensile strength , elongation at break , was computed to evaluate the tensile properties of the strips . 
 tensile strength ( ts ) was calculated by dividing the maximum load by the original cross - sectional area of the strip and it was expressed as ( n / cm ) . 
 percent elongation at break ( e% ) was calculated by dividing the length at the time of break of the strip by the initial length of the strip and multiplying by 100 using the following equation : 
 ( 2)e%=ll0l0100 , 
 where l0 is the initial length of the strip and l is the length at the time of break . 
 the calibration curve was performed with standards of the final concentrations of 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , and 100  ng / ml in rabbit plasma . 
 the intraday , interday precisions and accuracy of the method were determined with three replicates spiked plasma samples at different concentrations of clobazam . 
 the intraday and interday variation was calculated in terms of percent relative to standard deviation . 
 six rabbits of either sex ( weighed 2.5  0.2  kg ) were selected for the study . 
 all the rabbits were fasted overnight before the administration of the selected fast dissolving film and marketed formulation but had free access to water . 
 the rabbits were randomly divided into two groups with each group containing three rabbits ( n = 3 ) . 
 the rabbits were positioned on a table with lower jaw supported in a horizontal position and orally dissolving strip was carefully placed on the rabbit tongue in one group as shown in figure 12 . 
 blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected from marginal ear veins of rabbits immediately before drug administration and at 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 180  min , 6  hrs , 12 , and 24  hrs interval . 
 the plasma samples were prepared by mixing 0.1  ml of plasma with 0.05  ml ibuprofen as internal standard ( from the stock 6000  ng / ml ) in a clean eppendorf polypropylene tube and then extracting with 1.5  ml of acetonitrile after vertical agitation ( 1  min ) and centrifugation at 1000  rpm , for 5  min . 
 the hplc analysis was performed using agilent 1200 series system by using a mobile phase composed of water ph 3.5 , adjusted with orthophosphoric acid and acetonitrile ( 55  :  45  v / v ) , and binary eluted at a flow rate of 1.5  ml  min . 
 protocols for all the animal studies were approved by institutional ethical committee [ iaec / ccp/12/pr-007 ] . 
 maximum plasma concentration cmax and the time tmax were obtained directly from the individual plasma concentration versus time curves . 
 the terminal half - life , t1/2 , was obtained from log linear regression analysis of the plasma concentration time curves in the terminal phase . 
 the area under plasma concentration time curve ( auc0t , and auc0 ) was determined by linear trapezoidal method . for 90% confidence interval , 
 the auc and cmax values were transformed into their respective logarithms and analysis of variance was calculated using software kinetica 5.0 . 
 the in vivo percentage of the drug absorbed was plotted against the in vitro percentage of the drug released to determine the correlation coefficient . 
 the fraction of the drug absorbed was determined using the wagner nelson method , using the following equation : 
 ( 3)fa=[(ct+keauc0t)keauc0]100 , 
 where fa is the fraction of drug absorbed , ct is the plasma drug concentration at time t , ke is the overall elimination rate constant , and auc0t and auc0 are areas under the curve between time zero and time t and between time zero and infinity , respectively . 
 the optimized orally dissolving formulation of clobazam was subjected to stability studies by packing the individual strip in aluminum foil and loading the formulation on remi stability chamber sc-10 plus ( remi elektrotechnik ltd . , 
 vasai , india ) as per ich guidelines for 180 days at 40c  2c/75% rh  5% . 
 samples were withdrawn at regular intervals and evaluated for in vitro drug release , disintegration time , and tensile strength . 
 ftir spectra of pure drug and physical mixture of pva and clobazam as shown in figures 1(a ) , 1(b ) , and 1(c ) indicate that there was no interaction between drug and film forming polymer used . 
 pure clobazam displays a peak characteristic of c = o stretching vibration at 1694.7  cm , aromatic ch stretching at 3075.4  cm , c  c stretching at 1493.5  cm , c 
 n stretching at 11001200  cm , ch bending at 600800  cm , and ch3 bending at 1371  cm ; the spectra of drug with pva showed all characteristics peaks of drug indicating that the drug is compatible with pva . 
 dsc thermograms of clobazam ( pure drug ) , pva ( polymer ) , clobazam and ssg , and clobazam loaded orally dissolving strip as shown in figures 2(a ) , 2(b ) , and 2(c ) illustrated a sharp endothermic peak corresponding to the melting of crystalline clobazam at 180c . 
 the melting endothermic peak of clobazam was not observed in the drug loaded pva orally dissolving strip . 
 this indicates that clobazam was uniformly dispersed and present in an amorphous state in the polymeric matrix . 
 physicochemical characterization of clobazam films as given in table 4 indicated that all the strips prepared with different polymer concentrations were flexible , smooth , transparent , nonsticky , and homogeneous . 
 it was observed that there was no significant difference in the thickness among the strips , which indicated that the orally dissolving strips were uniform . 
 however , the folding endurance of the oral strip f7f9 was found to decrease with increasing content of pva . 
 thus , it appears that the increasing amount of pva decreases the flexibility of the strip . 
 since the surface ph of orally dissolving strips was found to be around neutral ph , there will not be any kind of irritation to the mucosal lining of the oral cavity . 
 all formulations were found to contain uniform quantities of drug ranging between 97.93% and 99.96% , as indicated by content uniformity studies . 
 in vitro disintegration time of the formulated orally dissolving strips 
 increase in the concentration of superdisintegrant decreases the disintegration time of films , which was observed in f1 , f2 , f3 , and f4 ; as the amount of pva increases , the disintegration time increases because of the increasing thickness of the strip but again decreases with increasing amount of ssg and formulation with f6 exhibited minimum disintegration time . 
 mathematical relationship generated using multiple linear regression analysis for the studied variable is expressed as follows : 
 ( 4)disintegration  time=28.32222 + 1.56667x1  4.33333x20.075000x1x2  0.33333x12 + 1.66667x22 . 
 the model f - value of 42.62 implies that the model is significant . 
 in vitro drug release was found to decrease with increase in the film forming polymer concentration which may be due to increase in the thickness of the oral strip and due to increase in the time required for wetting and dissolving the drug molecule present in the polymeric matrix but increase with increase in the concentration of the disintegrant . 
 formulations f1 , f2 , and f3 showed drug release up to 79.1% , 85% , and 89% , respectively , as shown in figures 4(a ) , 4(b ) , and 4(c ) at the end of 30  min . 
 film formed with higher quantity of polymer had shown slower dissolution rate ; this might be due to the increase level of pva that results in formation of high viscosity gel layer due to more intimate contact between the particles of polymer resulting in decrease in the mobility of drug particles from the swollen matrix , which leads to a decrease in the release rate . 
 the order of drug release in each set of formulation can be given as 
 ( 5)f1<f2<f3,f4<f5<f6,f7<f8<f9 . 
 the formulation f6 showed a maximum percentage drug release of 96.6% in 30  min as shown in figure 4(b ) . 
 reflection point at 30  min in the curve might be due to the complete solubilization of pva in the medium which improve the wettability and solubilize the drug and provide the fast dissolution rate . 
 further , drop in the percent of drug release after 30  min might be due to the availability of less number of drug molecules in the free void spaces and a decrease in mobility through polymeric matrix . 
 mathematical relationship generated using multiple linear regression analysis for the response variable is expressed as follows : 
 ( 6)%  drug  release=81.701115.16833x1  + 5.1683x2 + 1.00250x1x2  4.5016x12  + 1.99833x22 . 
 the model f - value of 77.23 implies that the model is significant . tensile strength and % 
 elongation were found to increase with the increasing content of pva which may be due the increase in the elasticity nature of the film forming polymer . 
 mathematical relationship generated using multiple linear regression analysis for the studied variable is expressed as follows : 
 ( 7)tensile  strength=2.39111 + 0.56500x1  + 0.31167x20.01500x1x2  0.1916x12 + 0.12833x22 . 
 addition of ssg affects tensile strength and % elongation ; higher concentration of ssg increases thickness and crystallinity of the film , which causes decrease in the tensile strength and % elongation . 
 there was a good linear correlation ( r = 0.9896  0.9999 ) obtained by plotting the percent of clobazam released from all the orally dissolving strip formulations against the square root of time . 
 thus , it was concluded that the release of clobazam from orally dissolving strip formulations followed a diffusion - controlled drug release profile and is in agreement with the higuchi model . 
 the results of multiple linear regression analysis are shown in table 6 , indicating that for all response variables which are disintegration time , tensile strength , and % drug release , the amount of pva ( x1 ) had a negative effect while the concentration of ssg ( x2 ) had a positive effect ; it means that as the amount of ssg increases the tensile strength , disintegration time decreases and there is increase in % drug release , while as the amount of pva is increased , both the tensile strength and disintegration time increase [ 3436 ] . 
 therefore , high level of ssg and medium level of pva should be selected for the rapid disintegration and a faster in vitro drug release of the film . 
 the observed values are in good agreement with the predicted values for the optimized formulation , which demonstrate the feasibility of surface response method in the formulation of oral fast dissolving films . 
 the comparison of observed values and predicted values with % prediction error is shown in table 7 . the data of the response surface plot as shown in figures 5 , 6 , and 7 demonstrated that both x1 and x2 affect the disintegration time , tensile strength , and % release of drug . 
 the surface morphology as shown in figure 8 using scanning electron microscopy of the optimized orally dissolving strip formulation of clobazam depicted smooth surface with some little pores , which is an indication of uniform distribution of drug particles . based on the responses the formulation f6 showing the highest dissolution rate , in vitro disintegration time suitable for fast - dissolving dosage form , and satisfactory tensile strength properties 
 was chosen for subsequent comparative study relative to a marketed clobazam formulation as shown in table 8 . 
 comparative results of in vitro drug release of f6 formulation and marketed formulation ( frisium5 ) as shown in figure 9 indicate that the optimized formulation was comparable to the marketed formulation . 
 the results from the hplc method validation in the rabbit plasma are shown in table 9 . 
 the within day and between day precision as given in terms of % relative standard deviation ranged from 0.5 to 6.2% and from 1.1 to 1.6% , respectively . 
 the mean clobazam plasma concentration time profiles for the prepared orally dissolving strip and the marketed tablets are shown in figure 10 . 
 the statistical comparison of cmax , auc0t , and auc0 indicated no significant difference between the two treatments ( test and reference marketed tablets ) . 
 the 90% confidence intervals for the mean ratio ( test / reference ) of cmax , auc0t , and auc0 were 95.87% , 98.12% , and 99.21% , respectively , and are shown in table 10 , while the acceptable range is 80125% for auc0t and auc0 , and 70143% for cmax , as proposed by the fda . 
 in vitro - in vivo correlation as shown in figure 11 of percentage drug absorbed and percentage drug released showed good in vitro - in vivo correlation for optimized film formulation f6 with r value 0.994 . 
 it was concluded that there was no significant change observed in the weight of orally dissolving strip , tensile strength , and % in vitro drug release . 
 the average clobazam content of formulation f6 after 6-month storage was 95.1  0.17  mg ( ranging from 91.88 to 96.80% ) . 
 therefore , the prepared formulation was stable up to 6 months at 40c ( 75%rh ) . 
 the orally dissolving strips of clobazam prepared using pva as film forming material and ssg as disintegrant by the solvent - casting method showed satisfactory drug dissolution and acceptable physicomechanical characteristics . 3 factorial design was used for the optimization , amongst nine formulations prepared as per the design layout , which indicates that the film prepared using 100  mg of pva and 6% of ssg ( f6 ) showed the highest dissolution rate , suitable in vitro disintegration time , and satisfactory tensile strength and was selected as the optimized formulation . in vivo studies also indicated absence of significant difference between f6 and frisium5 marketed tablets and both exhibited comparable drug plasma level - time profiles . accelerated stability studies results showed that prepared formulation was stable enough for the period of at least 6 months . 
 therefore , the present orodispersible film formulation containing clobazam considered is potentially useful for the treatment of epileptic attack where improved patient compliance and convenience are expected and can be used as an alternative to the fast dissolving tablet formulation .","clobazam orally dissolving strips were prepared by solvent casting method . 
 a full 32 factorial design was applied for optimization using different concentration of film forming polymer and disintegrating agent as independent variable and disintegration time , % cumulative drug release , and tensile strength as dependent variable . in addition 
 the prepared films were also evaluated for surface 
 ph , folding endurance , and content uniformity . 
 the optimized film formulation showing the maximum in vitro drug release , satisfactory in vitro disintegration time , and tensile strength was selected for bioavailability study and compared with a reference marketed product ( frisium5 tablets ) in rabbits . formulation ( f6 ) was selected by the design - expert software which exhibited dt ( 24  sec ) , ts ( 2.85  n / cm2 ) , and in vitro drug release ( 96.6% ) . 
 statistical evaluation revealed no significant difference between the bioavailability parameters of the test film ( f6 ) and the reference product . 
 the mean ratio values ( test / reference ) of cmax ( 95.87% ) , tmax ( 71.42% ) , auc0t ( 98.125% ) , and auc0 ( 99.213% ) indicated that the two formulae exhibited comparable plasma level - time profiles .",pubmed
"stroke is a major cause of death and disability world - wide . by 2020 stroke , together with coronary - artery disease , 
 stroke represents an often devastating disruption to life , the majority of survivors experiencing some degree of impairment requiring additional care or support 1 year post - stroke . 
 stroke is an acute event , but may result in significant long - term impact for the individual , such as social isolation , mood disturbance , communication difficulties and reduction in mobility and life roles . 
 recovery following stroke is complex and multidimensional , encompassing bio - medical , psychological and sociological elements [ 911 ] . 
 engagement in self - management practices by individuals with long - term conditions has been suggested as key to promoting recovery   and is cited as a means of empowerment and facilitator of improved health outcomes . 
 self - management is a prominent issue in uk health policy [ 1517 ] and has been identified as a key priority for health by organisations independent of the uk government . 
 self - management can be defined as the  active management by individuals of their treatment , symptoms , lifestyle , physical and psychological consequences inherent with living with a chronic condition  . 
 self - management is an attractive initiative in managing the increasing burden on health and social care resources and reducing associated costs ; the assumption being that effective self - management by an individual reduces their healthcare utilisation [ 2123 ] . 
 self - management interventions ( smis ) are designed to enable people to manage their health more effectively . 
 evaluation therefore must consider two key areas ; firstly whether people develop the skills to manage their own health and secondly , if this consequently results in better health . 
 is complex , not least due to variation in delivery , culture of the sponsoring healthcare organisation and anticipated goals and outcomes . 
 the uk medical research council advocates establishing the theoretical basis of an intervention as a first step in estimating its possible outcomes . 
 currently , evidence suggests that the mediators of change and theoretical premises in smis are unclear [ 2830 ] . 
 firstly , doubt exists regarding the appropriate outcome(s ) to monitor to assist evaluation of the intervention and aid determination of cost - effectiveness and clinical impact . 
 secondly , if the theoretical premises underpinning the intervention are uncertain , intervention fidelity is difficult to monitor and maintain . questions then exist regarding what influences change and how this can be appropriately measured and smis evaluated . 
 smis may be evaluated by examining the effect on health outcomes that potentially change as a consequence of better self - management . using patient 
 reported outcome measures ( proms ) ( e.g. functional status , symptom control , mood and health - related quality of life ) is an important way of to ensuring evaluation considers outcomes important to patients . 
 preliminary investigation of self - management suggests that effective self - management corresponds with positive changes in health behaviour . 
 more recently there has been a focus upon measuring attitudes since these are thought to modify health behaviour [ 2931 ] . 
 proms endeavor to capture information that is not directly observable and unmediated by healthcare professionals ; consequently accurate measurement is contingent on the extent that the prom is an accurate reflection of the variable in question . 
 therefore , it is vital to evaluate whether the measures adopted in smi studies provide legitimate information to evaluate self - management , both the process and obtaining of skills to better manage health and subsequent potential improvements in health . before using an outcome measure in research or clinical practice , 
 it should be assessed and considered to possess adequate psychometric properties . despite the recognised value of reliable and valid outcome measures and the increasing importance of identifying effective smis in stroke , we know of no review that has systematically evaluated international research for the quality of outcome measures used in stroke self - management . 
 the purpose of this article is to systematically review outcome measures used in stroke self - smis , with the aim of informing researchers , healthcare professionals and policy - makers and making recommendations for the design of future outcome measures suitable for use in stroke self - management . 
 this review seeks to systematically examine the outcome measures adopted in stroke smis in terms of the methodology adopted in their development and subsequent strength of their psychometric properties for use with stroke populations . 
 often the methodology adopted in reviews of outcome measures , use differing assessment standards , creating confusion for researchers and clinicians . a recent international delphi study of 57 experts ( 63% response rate ) resulted in a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties , referred to as the consensus - based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments ( cosmin ) checklist . 
 the cosmin list has good inter - rater agreement and reliability   and represents the first critical appraisal tool that is based on the consensus of experts in psychometric theory . 
 cosmin has been used in other systematic reviews examining the measurement properties of outcome measures in a range of health conditions [ 3941 ] . the delphi study consisted of four rounds and sought to reach consensus on the terminology and definitions to be adopted with regard to psychometrics . 
 this consensus offers both researchers and clinicians guidance with regard to some of the complexities of measurement properties . 
 cosmin also addresses modern psychometric theory methodology , such as item response theory , as well as classical test theory . 
 further information on cosmin can be accessed via www.cosmin.nl 
  the properties examined in this systematic review are defined by cosmin   and consist of nine items : internal consistency ; reliability ; measurement error ; content validity ; structural validity ; hypothesis testing ; cross - cultural validity ; criterion validity and responsiveness . 
 the purpose of the review is not to make a judgement on the quality of the smi studies , or to synthesize findings to answer questions regarding the effectiveness of the interventions in the review . 
 instead the review focuses upon the value of the outcome measures adopted within stroke smi studies according to their methodological quality , reliability and validity for stroke populations as outlined by cosmin .this is vital since judgments about the results and impact attributed to smis are dependent on valid and reliable measurement . in order to examine the properties of the outcome measures used in stroke smis , it was first necessary to identify which measures were used to evaluate the smis . 
 stroke self - management literature was systematically searched on the following electronic databases by one author ( e.j.b . ) : medline , psychinfo , science direct , web of science and cinahl . 
 the following terms were used to identify existing stroke smi studies : search terms were chosen to represent concepts often linked to self - management ( education , rehabilitation ) , however , studies were excluded unless they specifically stated their purpose was to enhance self - management . 
 article reference lists , website of uk government health department , generic internet search engines , and stroke - specific organisations were also searched . 
 dissertations and conference abstracts were excluded , however , searches for publications by dissertation or conference abstract authors were conducted . 
 selected articles described either ( 1 ) stroke - smi development and/or implementation or ( 2 ) presented outcomes of stroke smis . identified interventions and associated outcome measures were extracted and tabulated . 
 authors screened each abstract to eliminate articles that were not relevant , based on the following inclusion criteria : the study was published in english ; the article addressed self - management specific to stroke ; and was published between january 1990 and june 2011 , to examine the current and most relevant evidence for practice . 
 one reviewer ( e.j.b . ) assessed all relevant full text articles obtained and a second reviewer ( s.d . ) assessed 10% to check reliability . 
 outcome measures included in studies were then identified and recorded ( the version adopted by the smi was selected for review ) . a second literature search then sought to find evidence for the measurement properties ( as outlined by cosmin ) of those outcome measures identified . 
 the following electronic databases were used : medline , psychinfo , science direct , web of science and cinahl . 
 the following search terms were used in conjunction with the title of the identified outcome measure : for example , for a search on the validity of the geriatric depression scale , the search terms  stroke  and  validity  and  geriatric depression scale  was performed . 
 search terms were chosen to represent the properties of outcome measure quality as outlined by the cosmin checklist . 
 no time limitations were set as advocated by cosmin , since older literature on measurement properties is still relevant . 
 this is crucial since a measure s reliability and validity are on - going properties , dependent upon the context and population with which it is used . 
 for example , a measure developed to assess quality of life with a traumatic brain injury population will not necessarily possess acceptable content validity for stroke populations , since the issues faced by both populations may have similarities and differences . 
 article reference lists from the originating studies and generic internet search engines were also searched . 
 discussion between the authors sought to clarify any issues regarding terminology and interpretation of the cosmin checklist and preceded scoring of the identified measurement tools . 
 studies were excluded if they investigated postal or proxy reliability and validity unless this was how they were used in the smis . for outcome measures with more than one result per cosmin criteria , the article stating the most robust results was reviewed . where it was not clear that the study populations were specifically stroke , articles were excluded . 
 one reviewer ( e.j.b . ) assessed all relevant full text articles using a standard data extraction form advocated by cosmin . to ensure consistency of interpretation and scoring , a second reviewer ( s.d . ) independently scored a random 10% of the articles , with discussion between the two reviewers regarding the scores attained . 
 paper authors were contacted for further details where the study reported on early phases , or cited unpublished work . 
 ten items are used to assess whether a study meets the standard for good methodological quality . 
 two items contain general requirements for articles in which item response theory ( irt ) methods and general requirements for the generalisability of the results are applied . where a published paper does not report on a cosmin item 
 for example , if the responsiveness of the measure has yet to be determined , this item is not scored . 
 each item is rated as excellent ( + + + + ) , good ( + + + ) , fair ( + + ) or poor ( + ) . 
 43 abstracts were identified as potentially relevant studies and were screened ( 46 duplicate records were excluded ) . from these , 
 19 articles were retrieved and reviewed for inclusion criteria and data extraction ( studies were excluded because they did not meet the detailed criteria or if they reported on an earlier phase of the same study ) . 
 outcome measures within each study were then identified and grouped conceptually into different themes , using content analysis . 
 three studies of stroke - smis originated from the uk ; three from australia ; two from canada ; two from the usa ; two from sweden and one from hong kong . 
 nine studies reported upon interventions aimed at community - dwelling participants ; two upon the acute recovery phase ( <3 months post - stroke ) ; one upon recovery for care home residents and one study did not report details of the setting . 
 four studies delivered individualised interventions ; three utilised workbook interventions ; four tested group smis designed specifically for stroke and two tested existing self - management programs adapted for stroke . 
 interventions were delivered primarily ; by allied health professionals ( six ) ; nurse specialists ( four ) ; researcher ( two ) and lay experts ( one ) . 
 four studies identified primary outcomes ; health - related quality of life ; self - efficacy ; physical functioning   and feasibility . 
 although all studies focused upon stroke self - management , none measured stroke self - management as a discrete concept . instead , a range of concepts were measured which presumably were selected to reflect the expected outcomes or process of self - management . 
 evaluation relies upon judgements concerning the process of the smi and the outcome expected following participation in the smi . 
 the majority of measures used sought to measure health outcomes e.g. physical functioning , mood , quality of life ( figure 1 ) . 
 attitudes were also measured which could be considered to more readily reflect the process of self - management e.g. healthcare utilization , medication compliance although the theoretical mechanisms linking self - management to these concepts was not elucidated by the authors . 
 the term  unreported  is used in this review to describe an outcome measure that has not , at time of writing , been published in peer reviewed publicly available media . 
 unreported measures relate to those developed either by the study authors or through modifications made to existing measures without examination to ensure such assumptions or modifications were valid . 
 therefore , it is not possible to determine if unreported measures meet any of the cosmin criteria . 
 six studies adopted unreported measures of concepts presumably ( although the theoretical links were not explicitly stated by the authors ) , relating to the process of self - management , that had unknown reliability , validity , responsiveness . 
 allen et al .   included an unreported measure to assess condition management and patient and carer satisfaction with the intervention . 
 two studies used 10 point visual analogue rating scales ( vass ) to assess usefulness and intelligibility   and satisfaction   related to the intervention . whilst vass are brief and simple to administer and minimal in terms of respondent burden , without established reliability or validity relating to the underlying construct purported to be measured , they remain of limited value . 
 ljungberg and colleagues   designed four questions to assess life satisfaction pre- and post - participation in the smi and sit and colleagues   modified an existing stroke knowledge scale ; details of the modifications were absent in the paper . 
 marsden and colleagues   used a measure of stroke knowledge test , but stated clearly they were not basing inferences from the data obtained using this measure . 
 forty - three different outcome measures were adopted by studies in this review of measures used in stroke smis . of these , 
 21 measures ( 49% ) demonstrated some properties in stroke populations , according to the cosmin checklist   ( table ii ) . 
 for the remaining measures no evidence could be found for any of the cosmin properties in stroke populations ( n = 16 , 39% ) , or the measures were observer - based assessments ( n = 5 , 12% ) .

 cosmin property scores in stroke populations of outcome measures used in stroke self - management interventions . 
 a summary of how the measures included in the stroke smi studies scored according to cosmin , when examined for their measurement properties with stroke populations , is shown in figure 2 . 
 none scored in every category of cosmin . where more than one paper addressed a cosmin category , the article which stated the most robust results was scored . the majority of measures scored either 
 three measures scored  excellent  in this category as follows ; the stroke adapted sickness impact profile ( sa - sip30 ) ; the stroke self - efficacy questionnaire ( sseq ) and the subjective index of physical and social outcome ( sipso ) . 
 this review examined the methodological quality of studies determining the psychometric properties of outcome measures , used in stroke smis according to criteria outlined by the cosmin checklist . 
 consistent with measurement theory we explored the validity and reliability of these measures for use in people with stroke , not their general use in broader populations . to our knowledge , this is the first review to systematically appraise and summarize the evidence on the quality of outcome measures used in stroke smis . 
 since no study adopted a measure of stroke self - management attitudes or behaviours , the theoretical concepts utilised by studies in the review to measure self - management will first be addressed . 
 the range and number of different published outcome measures adopted by studies in this review   may suggest a current lack of consensus regarding the appropriate measures to assist evaluation of stroke smis . alternatively , the use of heterogeneous measures may be reflective of recognition by researchers that self - management embraces a range of differing concepts . 
 the current absence of consensus may in part reflect an underlying lack of consensus about the concept and operation of self - management in stroke . 
 in addition , most smis have been developed for generic audiences , which may partly explain the lack of specific measures developed for stroke self - management . 
 an argument exists for research to investigate the conceptual properties of stroke self - management , to examine which measurement concepts currently being used , if any , are appropriate . 
 some captured health outcomes , such as physical functioning , which the study authors anticipated may be affected by the smi ; others attempted to capture behaviours , such as resource utilisation or attitudes , such as changes in self - efficacy thought to be associated with self - management processes ( figure 2 ) . 
 however , how the concepts measured align with the patient experience of stroke self - management remain unknown . physical function ( pf ) was most often used as an indicator of effective self - management . of the 21 measures possessing at least one property of the cosmin checklist in this review , 11 related to pf ( 52% ) . 
 this is potentially suggestive of an assumption that effective self - management results in improved pf , or that improved pf is a desired outcome . 
 pf appears to remain a dominant concept within stroke rehabilitation , despite increasing evidence of the role of psychosocial factors in recovery [ 5355 ] . 
 for example , the measurement of pf is of limited value in studies that target speech disorder , depression , social participation or cognitive function , debatably all factors in effective stroke self - management . 
 questions regarding the differing priorities of rehabilitation between healthcare professionals and those affected by stroke have been raised before . 
 effective self - management extends beyond the ability to perform certain tasks , encompassing decision making and choices regarding health and behaviour . 
 the role of pf in stroke self - management requires further clarification before it can be adopted as a robust indicator of effective self - management . 
 . however , issues of potential greater importance to patients , for example a change in confidence or increased awareness about how to manage fatigue , may not be captured in measures focused upon management of health behaviours or resource utilisation . 
 there is a need to further conceptualise stroke self - management to ensure that self - management strategies pertinent to people recovering from stroke are captured in existing or new outcome measures . 
 eight of the studies in this review explicitly cited a theoretical basis to the intervention adopted in the study ( table i ) . 
 the most commonly cited theory was psychologist albert bandura s social cognition theory and the concept of self - efficacy ( n = 4 studies ) . 
 self - efficacy can be described as the belief in one s capabilities to organise and execute the course of action required , to produce given achievements . 
 the validity of outcome measures is contingent upon using them for the purpose they were intended for . 
 of the four studies citing self - efficacy as a theoretical premise underpinning the intervention , only two studies utilised outcome measures to reflect change attributed to this theoretical concept in the interventions . the measure adopted by kendall and colleagues , the self - efficacy scale , 
 has unknown psychometric properties in stroke populations , and therefore requires further examination to establish its validity for use in these populations . 
 the stroke self - efficacy scale adopted by jones and colleagues   was developed with stroke populations . 
 data were generated with people a relatively short time frame since stroke ( mean duration was 4.2 weeks and 16 days post - stroke for two of the development phases ) . 
 this may not represent sufficient time since stroke for individuals to adequately appraise their situation , especially as some were still in hospital . 
 the relationship to self - management of any of the measures in this review was not explicitly stated by any of the study authors . 
 this suggests that further clarification is required to determine the extent to which they reflect the process or outcomes of self - management . 
 whilst potential theoretical bases for the self - management of long - term conditions , such as self - efficacy , have gained increasing acknowledgement , the role in stroke self - management remains unclear . 
 this is in part due to a lack of robust outcome measures and , in addition , a lack of clarity regarding the purported theoretical foundations of stroke self - management . a paucity of measures scored  excellent  or  good  for quality according to the criteria outlined by cosmin ( figure 2 ) . 
 the cosmin checklist does not advocate summarising the quality criteria into one overall quality score , as is often the case in other systematic reviews . 
 since measurement properties are in part affected by the context in which they have been determined , this approach would be misleading . 
 for example in our review , no measure was scored on cross - cultural validity , since the purpose of the review was not to assess how well a measure had been developed and validated in other languages or cultures . 
 outcome measures should be developed with involvement of the target population to identify what is meaningful from their perspective and hence enhance content validity and clinical utility . 
 three measures scored  excellent  in the content validity category ( sseq ; sipso ; sa - sip30 ) . 
 measures that did not include involvement of users in the development of the measure scored  poor  on the cosmin checklist , regardless of other aspects of the content validity process which may have been classed  fair 
 this is partly as a result of the cosmins scoring method in which the lowest score in any given category counts , but is also indicative of the importance of involving potential users in measurement development . 
 arguably , measures developed without user - involvement have questionable meaning and other types of validity , since without steps in the design to capture the experience of the population to be measured , the context of the measure remains largely that of the measure developers . 
 more recently techniques such as cognitive interviewing , have been used by researchers   to ensure the content validity of new measures is optimal . 
 difficulty exists in determining which measures used in the stroke smis in this review reflect self - management with validity since most measures did not score well according to the cosmin criteria . 
 several studies included unreported measures , designed specifically by the authors for the purpose of the smi study [ 44,4852 ] . with the exception of marsden et al . 
 an absence of psychometric data confounds the ability to draw reliable inferences from studies adopting those measures . 
 in addition , a lack of information regarding the development or modification of unreported measures limits the ability to make judgments upon the validity and appropriateness of the measure . 
 a further possible limitation on interpreting data from unreported measures may be a tendency for reporting positive results . without establishment of reliability and validity 
 the outcome measure is little more than a collection of items that have meaning to the developer alone . given the lack of consensus of how stroke self - management operates in the literature , and a lack of consensus upon the theoretical premises grounding stroke smis , the assumptions underpinning unreported measures remain speculative . 
 researchers and clinicians should exercise caution in considering findings from studies adopting unreported measures . of note 
 is that 11 studies ( 85% ) within this review adopted at least one outcome measure without reported validity and reliability with stroke populations . 
 the reporting of minimal , or non - significant , observed changes following stroke smis in those studies including measures without established psychometric properties in stroke populations may be indicative of a lack of relevance and meaningfulness of those measures to stroke populations . 
 problems exist in using unreported measures when determining whether change occurred as a result of an ineffective intervention or due to imprecise measures . 
 measures developed with intended user populations , facilitate the gaining of information about health , illness and the effects of health - care interventions from the perspective of the patient . as well as enhancing content validity , 
 this is of particular relevance to those involved in promoting self - management and increasing patient autonomy , such as nurses and therapists . 
 responsiveness is a necessary property of instruments intended for measuring clinically meaningful change , such as in stroke self - smis . 
 arguments exist that responsiveness should focus upon detecting change that is valued by the person rather than the clinician or researcher . 
 change attributed to an intervention is an important aspect of evaluating clinical effectiveness . in this review , 
 none of these measures scored  excellent  for this property , and only 15% scored  good  . aside from inadequate sample sizes , a common finding was that studies often were not clear about what happened to study populations between testing . 
 there is , therefore , a need for future measurement developers to specify these overlooked aspects of development more clearly in subsequent reporting . 
 the majority of smi study populations within this review experienced stroke < 24 months previously , with a number of studies using populations experiencing stroke no more than 6 months previously . 
 this may be a result of sampling to reduce the influence of additional factors upon study outcomes , such as the development of unhelpful coping behaviours , the likelihood of which might increase over time , and out of an assumption that more change may be observed in those early in their recovery . 
 however , in reality the number of people living in the community and recovering from stroke extends beyond those who are 624 months post - stroke . as engagement in self - management activities varies during recovery , particularly following adjustment to stroke as a long - term condition , there is a future need to consider outcome measures sensitive to change(s ) at different durations since stroke . 
 the role of proms , developed using rigorous investigation with the population to be measured extends beyond validating patient experience . 
 proms may improve the quality of interactions between health professionals and patients , assess levels of health and need , and provide evidence of outcomes of services , for the purposes of audit , quality assurance and comparative performance evaluation . 
 this is of particular importance when trying to capture the essence of self - management , since the experience of clients is vital in determining what is valued from their perspective . 
 there is a need to focus upon the development of measures of self - management developed with people recovering from stroke . 
 consensus between reviewers was used to determine eligibility and inclusion of smi articles . whilst we were in agreement 
 however , the use of a standardized critical appraisal tool may assist the selection of articles for future reviews . 
 where interpretation of the cosmin criteria differed , agreement was reached by discussion and consensus . 
 additional reviewers may have further validated this process however the criteria within cosmin are explicitly stated and differences were quickly resolved . 
 data extraction was facilitated by a standardized tool advocated by cosmin , with extraction and scoring checked in a random 10% of articles.we acknowledge that checking of 10% may be viewed as a limitation of this review , however , assert that a systematic process using a standard data extraction tool was followed throughout . that cosmin operates a 
 lowest score counts  scoring system may account for the lack of measures scoring well in the measurement property criteria . some studies used otherwise appropriate methodologies , but were rated as  poor  due to inadequate sample sizes for analyses . for example , for a measure to be rated as  good  for reliability , measurement error , criterion validity and responsiveness , a sample size of n = 5099 
 , the sample size required increased to five times the number of items within a measure ( and 100 or 57 * # items but < 100 ) . 
 therefore , if those studies were repeated with larger sample sizes , their ratings according to cosmin could change dramatically . 
 the tendency for measures to score poorly may be reflective of a floor effect of the cosmin checklist . 
 cosmin was developed following consensus of experts in health measurement , therefore if its stringent criteria is to be adopted this is indicative of a need to debate the rigorous methods for measure development required . 
 it is fair to comment that some of the measures in this review were developed before the focus upon involving potential users in measure development . 
 it may be that the measures examined in this review require further development and investigation to establish adequate measurement properties for use with stroke populations . 
 our recommendations for clinicians and researchers seeking to evaluate such interventions would be firstly to clarify the theoretical premise of the intervention in question , as advocated elsewhere . without this step , 
 it is difficult to identify the mechanisms by which the intervention may influence outcomes , and thus difficult to select an outcome measure which appropriately captures the potential outcome . 
 potential outcome measures should be selected on the basis that they appropriately reflect and capture the expected outcome change . 
 this review highlights that the reported theoretical drivers within stroke smis are unclear , not least because they are often not explicitly stated by researchers . 
 the heterogeneity of the outcome measures utilised by smis in this review may indicate a difficulty in determining the expected outcomes of stroke smis . 
 a systematic review demonstrated that interventions with specific aims , such as reduced systolic blood pressure in hypertension or glycosylated haemoglobin levels in diabetes , produced greater effect sizes than those without defined outcomes . 
 further work is therefore warranted to conceptualise stroke self - management and examine the theoretical premises supporting such interventions , and expected outcomes so that appropriate outcome measures which accurately reflect the concept can be selected and/or developed . until such clarification , researchers and clinicians should , where possible , select outcome measures with reliability and validity data in the population to be tested in the intervention . the selection of outcome measures developed with involvement from the target population is also advocated . 
 this ensures that what is meaningful to the patient is more likely to be captured appropriately , thus enhancing content validity . in the meantime 
 , researchers must support clinicians by conducting further work to examine the concept and theoretical premises of self - management and developing appropriate measures if required . 
 the range and number of different published outcome measures adopted by studies in this review   may suggest a current lack of consensus regarding the appropriate measures to assist evaluation of stroke smis . alternatively , the use of heterogeneous measures may be reflective of recognition by researchers that self - management embraces a range of differing concepts . 
 the current absence of consensus may in part reflect an underlying lack of consensus about the concept and operation of self - management in stroke . 
 in addition , most smis have been developed for generic audiences , which may partly explain the lack of specific measures developed for stroke self - management . 
 an argument exists for research to investigate the conceptual properties of stroke self - management , to examine which measurement concepts currently being used , if any , are appropriate . 
 some captured health outcomes , such as physical functioning , which the study authors anticipated may be affected by the smi ; others attempted to capture behaviours , such as resource utilisation or attitudes , such as changes in self - efficacy thought to be associated with self - management processes ( figure 2 ) . 
 however , how the concepts measured align with the patient experience of stroke self - management remain unknown . physical function ( pf ) was most often used as an indicator of effective self - management . of the 21 measures possessing at least one property of the cosmin checklist in this review , 11 related to pf ( 52% ) . 
 this is potentially suggestive of an assumption that effective self - management results in improved pf , or that improved pf is a desired outcome . 
 pf appears to remain a dominant concept within stroke rehabilitation , despite increasing evidence of the role of psychosocial factors in recovery [ 5355 ] . 
 for example , the measurement of pf is of limited value in studies that target speech disorder , depression , social participation or cognitive function , debatably all factors in effective stroke self - management . 
 questions regarding the differing priorities of rehabilitation between healthcare professionals and those affected by stroke have been raised before . 
 effective self - management extends beyond the ability to perform certain tasks , encompassing decision making and choices regarding health and behaviour . 
 the role of pf in stroke self - management requires further clarification before it can be adopted as a robust indicator of effective self - management . 
 . however , issues of potential greater importance to patients , for example a change in confidence or increased awareness about how to manage fatigue , may not be captured in measures focused upon management of health behaviours or resource utilisation . 
 there is a need to further conceptualise stroke self - management to ensure that self - management strategies pertinent to people recovering from stroke are captured in existing or new outcome measures . 
 eight of the studies in this review explicitly cited a theoretical basis to the intervention adopted in the study ( table i ) . 
 the most commonly cited theory was psychologist albert bandura s social cognition theory and the concept of self - efficacy ( n = 4 studies ) . 
 self - efficacy can be described as the belief in one s capabilities to organise and execute the course of action required , to produce given achievements . 
 the validity of outcome measures is contingent upon using them for the purpose they were intended for . 
 of the four studies citing self - efficacy as a theoretical premise underpinning the intervention , only two studies utilised outcome measures to reflect change attributed to this theoretical concept in the interventions . the measure adopted by kendall and colleagues , the self - efficacy scale , 
 has unknown psychometric properties in stroke populations , and therefore requires further examination to establish its validity for use in these populations . 
 the stroke self - efficacy scale adopted by jones and colleagues   was developed with stroke populations . 
 data were generated with people a relatively short time frame since stroke ( mean duration was 4.2 weeks and 16 days post - stroke for two of the development phases ) . 
 this may not represent sufficient time since stroke for individuals to adequately appraise their situation , especially as some were still in hospital .

 this is the first systematic review of international research on outcome measures used and selected in stroke self - smi studies . 
 we have identified important limitations in the measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of stroke self - smis , which has significant implications for the inferences we are currently able to draw about the evidence base . 
 none of the measures used in studies of stroke smis , purported to specifically measure self - management as a discrete concept . 
 this is indicative of the difficulty in conceptualisation and operation of this concept , a view expressed elsewhere . 
 further work is required to determine how the measures identified in this review , align with the concept of self - management . 
 the range of outcomes adopted , the lack of observed changes in outcomes following stroke smis and the lack of consensus surrounding which outcome measures to utilise , indicates that the causal mechanisms of stroke smis remain imprecise . 
 stroke smis have raced ahead of the evidence to support their theoretical basis , operation and effective evaluation . 
 work to conceptualise stroke self - management is required to help identify which outcomes are most appropriate for evaluating interventions , to further inform the theoretical basis for smis   and to assist the development of interventions . 
 there is a need for studies to explore the theoretical underpinnings of smi in stroke and for the development of robust outcome measures to enable evaluation of stroke smis .","purposeto systematically review the psychometric properties of outcome measures used in stroke self - management interventions ( smis ) to ( 1 ) inform researchers , clinicians and commissioners about the properties of the measures in use and ( 2 ) make recommendations for the future development of self - management measurement in stroke.methodselectronic databases , government websites , generic internet search engines and hand searches of reference lists . 
 abstracts were selected against inclusion criteria and retrieved for appraisal and systematically scored , using the cosmin checklist.resultsthirteen studies of stroke self - management originating from six countries were identified . 
 forty - three different measures ( mean 5.08/study , sd 2.19 ) were adopted to evaluate self - smis . 
 no studies measured self - management as a discreet concept . six ( 46% ) studies included untested measures . 
 eleven ( 85% ) studies included at least one measure without reported reliability and validity in stroke populations.conclusionsthe use of outcome measures which are related , indirect or proxy indicators of self - management and that have questionable reliability and validity , contributes to an inability to sensitively evaluate the effectiveness of stroke self - smis . 
 further enquiry into how the concept of self - management in stroke operates , would help to clarify the nature and range of specific self - management activities to be targeted and aid the selection of existing appropriate measures or the development of new measures.implications for rehabilitationthe evaluation of complex interventions such as self - management interventions is aided by clear outcome expectations and valid and reliable measurement.this review demonstrates a lack of outcome measures that specifically measure self - management of stroke . 
 a minority of outcome measures that were used as proxy indicators for sm fulfill some of the criteria for quality outlined in the cosmin checklist.clinicians should select measures which appropriately reflect expected outcomes , giving due consideration to the theoretical underpinnings of the intervention . 
 further work is required to establish which measures currently in use , if any , accurately reflect stoke self-management.in the meantime , researchers should seek to develop psychometrically sound measures of stroke self - management to assist effective evaluation of such interventions in stroke .",pubmed
"hemoptysis is one of the most common symptoms in patients with respiratory diseases , when massive , has a mortality rate of more than 50% 
 . therefore , significant or life - threatening hemoptysis calls for quick treatment to stop bleeding . in the past 
 , the control of hemoptysis had been obtained using surgical methods if conservative management failed to be effective . but 
 patients with massive hemoptysis may be associated with high morbidity and mortality using conservative or surgical management . 
 it is a safe and effective treatment , not only for massive hemoptysis , but also for chronic or recurrent hemoptysis that impairs the patient 's quality of life . 
 the first procedure for embolization therapy is a complete angiography of the pulmonary vascular tree when bleeding bronchial arteries are seen , embolization therapy is carried out . 
 this retrospective study was undertaken to determine the demographic characteristics , clinical features , results of imaging techniques , complications related to bae , and follow - up of 344 patients underwent bae . 
 this study was a retrospective analysis of 344 cases , who underwent bronchial arteriography at tianjin haihe hospital between 2006 and 2013 . 
 the patients were hospitalized due to hemoptysis , with the volume of blood ranging 502000 ml/24 h. each patient underwent standard medical management , but the hemoptysis still occurred , so they underwent bronchial arteriography at first and underwent bae when necessary . 
 there were 186 men and 158 women , with a mean age of 57 years old ( ranging 1783 years old ) . 
 two hundred and thirty - four patients had acute and massive hemoptysis , and 110 patients had chronic and recurrent hemoptysis ( recurrent rate at least 3 times in 1 year ) . 
 the data for outcome analysis were obtained from the clinical records , all of the radiological images were reviewed as possible . 
 we collected such data for analysis : clinical features ; chest computed tomography ( ct ) scan ; bronchial ateriography , bae , and results ; embolization material ; complications related to bae ; and follow - up . 
 about 317 patients ( 92.2% ) were suggestive of causes of hemoptysis , and 27 patients ( 7.8% ) showed focal hemorrhage . 
 blood lobe could be identified by chest ct scan in 105 cases ( 30.5% ) . 
 bleeding source could be localized in unilateral lung but could not be defined in an exact lobe in 90 cases ( 36.2% ) . 
 both of the lungs had unusual film but not focal hemorrhage in 149 patients ( 43.3% ) . 
 the findings of angiography suggested that few direct sign found during arteriography , most of the indirect appearances that support a site of bleeding include tortuosity , hypertrophy , hypervascularity , aneurysms , extravasation , and bronchial artery to pulmonary artery or vein shunting . in 131 
 patients ( 38.1% ) , only left - side bronchial arteries were abnormal ; in 69 patients , only right - side bronchial arteries were abnormal ; in the other 144 patients , bilateral bronchial arteries were abnormal . 
 as the statistics , 944 responsible bronchial arteries involves in according to the angiography : 275 right bronchial arteries ; 200 left bronchial arteries ; 170 combined right and left bronchial trunk ; 123 right intercostal arteries ; other 176 arteries [ figure 1 ] . 
 we analyzed the responsible arteries for tuberculosis , bronchiectasis , bronchogenic carcinomas and undefined reasons as follow [ table 1 ] . 
 a spinal artery was identified in three patients , one spinal artery originated from the left bronchial artery , one from the right intercostal artery , and one from the right subclavian artery . 
 the numbers of responsible arteries for different diseases despite of which kind of causations , the main responsible arteries were right bronchial artery , left bronchial artery and combined right and left bronchial trunk ; more right intercostal arteries were involved than left . 
 bronchial artery embolization was performed in 336 of 344 patients ( 97.7% ) , artery spasm and closure occurred in six patients , arterial subintimal dissection occurred in one patient , and the responsible vessel could nt be super - selective in one patient because of combining with the spinal artery . 
 overall , there were 1530 embolization coils for the 336 patients with a total of 920 arteries embolized ( including bronchial and nonbronchial systemic arteries ) . according to the chest ct scanning and bronchial arteriography , we concluded the etiologies of the hemoptysis in 344 cases : tuberculosis in 190 patients ( 55.2% ) , bronchiectasis in 99 patients ( 28.8% ) , malignancy in 20 patients ( 5.8% ) , undefined in 18 patients ( 5.2% ) , pneumonia in six patients ( 1.8% ) , deformity of bronchial artery in six patients ( 1.8% ) , bronchial artery aneurysm in one patients ( 0.2% ) , other pulmonary disease in four patients ( 1.2% ) . 
 bronchial artery embolization was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 330 of 344 patients ( 96% ) . 
 61 patients ( 17.7% ) had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month after undergoing bae , only three of them were performed a second bae , two patients had rebleeding in the previous site , one was found new bleeding area . 
 three of these patients died of massive hemoptysis in 1 month after undergoing embolization ( two patients with bronchogenic carcinoma and one with tuberculosis ) , one patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died of hypercapnia in 3 days after undergoing embolization . 
 the two patients in whom an embolization procedure could not be performed ( one because of spinal artery combined with the hemorrhage vessel and one was under subintimal dissection ) , taken medical treatment for 1 week , the hemoptysis were gradually controlled . 
 each patient performed bae had a repeated chest ct scanning after 1 month , which showed that there was no coil dropping or shifting . 
 seventy four patients ( 21.5% ) had recurrent hemoptysis over 1 month after undergoing bae . 
 forty - four patients were performed a repeated embolization , all of the bronchial arteriograms bronchial arteriograms showed there was no dropping of the coil , in 17 patients developed recanalization of the previously embilzed vessels , the remaining 27 patients developed new blood vessels responsible for hemorrhage . 
 one hundred and seven patients ( 31.1% ) had a fever ( < 38.5c ) after bae . 
 chest pain postprocedure occurred in 65 patients ( 18.9% ) , back pain in 51 patients ( 14.8% ) , shoulder pain postprocedure in 29 patients ( 8.4% ) , and transient dysphagia or lower limb numbness in three patients ( 0.9% ) . 
 all of the patients had been followed up over 1 month after bae except the four patients had been died within 1 month . 
 two hundred and forty - eight patients had a telephone call follow - up recently ( follow - up periods ranging from 6 months to 8 years ) . 
 it revealed that 28 patients had been dead , six of them died of massive hemorrhage , seven died of deterioration of lung disease but not bleeding , the remainder died of other diseases or accident . 
 four patients died within 1 year after due to advanced lung cancer ( one had a massive bleeding out of controlling ) , 24 patients died during 24 years after bae . 
 twenty - one patients have recurrent hemoptysis after repeated bae , the volume of bleeding is < 5 ml / d . 
 one hundred and ninety - nine patients had follow - up periods ranging from 6 months to 8 years without evidence of recurrent hemoptysis . 
 about 317 patients ( 92.2% ) were suggestive of causes of hemoptysis , and 27 patients ( 7.8% ) showed focal hemorrhage .

 bronchial artery embolization was performed in 336 of 344 patients ( 97.7% ) , artery spasm and closure occurred in six patients , arterial subintimal dissection occurred in one patient , and the responsible vessel could nt be super - selective in one patient because of combining with the spinal artery . 
 overall , there were 1530 embolization coils for the 336 patients with a total of 920 arteries embolized ( including bronchial and nonbronchial systemic arteries ) . 
 according to the chest ct scanning and bronchial arteriography , we concluded the etiologies of the hemoptysis in 344 cases : tuberculosis in 190 patients ( 55.2% ) , bronchiectasis in 99 patients ( 28.8% ) , malignancy in 20 patients ( 5.8% ) , undefined in 18 patients ( 5.2% ) , pneumonia in six patients ( 1.8% ) , deformity of bronchial artery in six patients ( 1.8% ) , bronchial artery aneurysm in one patients ( 0.2% ) , other pulmonary disease in four patients ( 1.2% ) . 
 bronchial artery embolization was successful in controlling hemoptysis immediately in 330 of 344 patients ( 96% ) . 
 61 patients ( 17.7% ) had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month after undergoing bae , only three of them were performed a second bae , two patients had rebleeding in the previous site , one was found new bleeding area . 
 three of these patients died of massive hemoptysis in 1 month after undergoing embolization ( two patients with bronchogenic carcinoma and one with tuberculosis ) , one patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died of hypercapnia in 3 days after undergoing embolization . 
 the two patients in whom an embolization procedure could not be performed ( one because of spinal artery combined with the hemorrhage vessel and one was under subintimal dissection ) , taken medical treatment for 1 week , the hemoptysis were gradually controlled . 
 each patient performed bae had a repeated chest ct scanning after 1 month , which showed that there was no coil dropping or shifting . 
 seventy four patients ( 21.5% ) had recurrent hemoptysis over 1 month after undergoing bae . 
 forty - four patients were performed a repeated embolization , all of the bronchial arteriograms bronchial arteriograms showed there was no dropping of the coil , in 17 patients developed recanalization of the previously embilzed vessels , the remaining 27 patients developed new blood vessels responsible for hemorrhage . 
 one hundred and seven patients ( 31.1% ) had a fever ( < 38.5c ) after bae . 
 chest pain postprocedure occurred in 65 patients ( 18.9% ) , back pain in 51 patients ( 14.8% ) , shoulder pain postprocedure in 29 patients ( 8.4% ) , and transient dysphagia or lower limb numbness in three patients ( 0.9% ) . 
 all of the patients had been followed up over 1 month after bae except the four patients had been died within 1 month . 
 two hundred and forty - eight patients had a telephone call follow - up recently ( follow - up periods ranging from 6 months to 8 years ) . 
 it revealed that 28 patients had been dead , six of them died of massive hemorrhage , seven died of deterioration of lung disease but not bleeding , the remainder died of other diseases or accident . 
 four patients died within 1 year after due to advanced lung cancer ( one had a massive bleeding out of controlling ) , 24 patients died during 24 years after bae . 
 twenty - one patients have recurrent hemoptysis after repeated bae , the volume of bleeding is < 5 ml / d . 
 one hundred and ninety - nine patients had follow - up periods ranging from 6 months to 8 years without evidence of recurrent hemoptysis . 
 earlier , besides medical treatment , surgery was the fast and best method to control the bleeding . 
 but it required patients many preparations , such as chest ct , pulmonary function , even bronchoscopy to evaluate the patient physical condition and determine the range of surgery . 
 some preparations were impossible for the patients in emergency conditions , the impairment of surgery was so great for a lot of people that gravely lowered the quality of life . 
 bae is a well - established procedure used to control massive hemoptysis since it first performed in 1974 . 
 subsequently , bae was widely used , because non - operable patients could be treated and other patients could be stabilized prior to surgery . in clinical , 
 about 1 hour is needed to prepare before bae , and the physical requirements of patient are lower than for surgery . 
 the technology is mostly described the outcomes in control of hemoptysis due to varies causations . in some conditions , interventional embolization can be used before surgery . in our study , 
 of the 344 cases , an immediate control of bleeding was achieved with embolization in 330 patients ( 96% ) , similar to the immediate success rate was reported 7598% earlier . 
 recurrent bleeding despite apparently adequate embolotherapy remains a considerable problem , some reported with bleeding occurring in 942% of patients after embolization . in our series , rebleeding occurred within 30 days in 61 of 344 patients ( 17.7% ) . 
 a second embolization procedure was performed in three patients , two patients were found rebleeding in the previous points , and one was found new bleeding arteries . 
 overall the patients , 54 of whom rebleeding over 1 month in the follow - up , 44 of whom were performed a second bronchial arteriography . in 27 patients , 
 an additional bronchial or nonbronchial collateral artery was embolized resulting in the successful control of hemoptysis , 17 patients developed recanalization of the previously embilzed vessels and had been embolizied again . in the recurrent hemoptysis patients , 
 the etiologies were mainly due to cancer , tuberculosis , and severe bronchietasis ( at least two lobes were suffered ) . 
 the disease development contributed to the rebleeding . in our series , a patient with cancer was performed in bae for three times , and a patient with tuberculosis was performed for five times , both of whom were not suitable for surgery . 
 so it has shown that bae is an effective procedure with which to definitively treat some patients with hemoptysis and can be repeatedly utilized . 
 as we know , the source of massive hemoptysis in 90% of cases due to the brochial circulation , as well as the remaining 10% divided equally between the pulmonary circulation ( 5% ) and other systemic arterial supply to the lungs . 
 it is well - documented that the anatomy of bronchial arteries is variable form person to person , typically origin arises from the descending aorta between the levels of the t5 and t6 vertebrae . 
 four classic patterns of origin were described : type i ( 40% ) : two on the left and one on the right , presenting as an intercostobronchial trunk ( icbt ) ; type ii ( 21% ) : one on the left and one icbt on the right ; type iii ( 20% ) : two on the left and one on the right ( one icbt and one bronchial artery ) ; type iv ( 9.7% ) : one on the left and two on the right ( one icbt and one bronchial artery ) . according to the statistics , 
 the main responsible vessels for bleeding are right bronchial arteries , left bronchial arteries , combined right and left bronchial trunk , right intercostal arteries . in different etiologies , the rate of abnormal arteries is coincidence with the result . 
 the bronchial arteriography showed that more right intercostal arteries combining with bronchial artery than left . 
 the distribution and frequency of embolization of the arteries were agreed with kwon et al . usually 
 , a spinal artery can originate from a bronchial artery in up to 5% of patients , with right side being more common than the left side . as our observation , 
 a spinal artery was identified in three of our patients , with two occurring on the right side and one occurring on the left side . 
 our result showed that tuberculosis ( 55.2% ) , bronchiectasis ( 28.8% ) , malignancy ( 5.8% ) , undefined ( 5.2% ) , pneumonia ( 1.8% ) , deformity of bronchial artery ( 1.8% ) , bronchial artery aneurysm ( 0.2% ) , other pulmonary disease ( 1.2% ) . 
 , the etiologies of hemoptysis included tuberculosis ( 34% ) , bronchiectasis ( 26% ) , aspergilloma ( 18% ) , neumoconiosis in coal miners ( 13% ) , and bronchogenic carcinoma ( 3% ) . 
 knott - craig et al . retrospectively studied 120 patients with hemoptysis and found that the right lung was the source in 62% and the left lung in 38% , with the right upper lobe being the area that was most commonly affected . 
 our results were that the right lung was the source of bleeding in 131 patients ( 38.1% ) , the left lung was the source in 69 patients ( 20.0% ) , and both lungs were the source in 144 patients ( 41.8% ) . 
 the common complications of bae included subintimal dissection , arterial perforation by a guidewire , and reflux of embolic material into the artery without adverse sequelaed during the procedure , and fever , chest pain , dyspnea , transient dysphagia , groin hematoma , even headache or blindness etc . 
 several patients developed transverse myelitis as a result of inadvertent embolization of the spinal arteries . during the procedure of bae , when a spinal artery was founding , 
 but in contrast , mal et al . observed the brown - sequard 's syndrome , following three episodes of spinal cord complications , which regressed after 4 months without sequelae ; paraparesis with spontaneous regression after 2 weeks ; and complete paraplegia without regression . 
 if a spinal artery arises from a bronchial artery , we will only embolize the bronchial artery if we can achieve a stable distal position well beyond the spinal artery origin . 
 our patients showed transistent complications such as fever , chest pain , shoulder pain , groin hematoma , all the symptoms were disappeared in 48 hours , and fewer of our patients experienced any neurologic sequelae . 
 observed the outcome of bae : the hemoptysis control rate was 93.1% at the end of 2 weeks , 85.7% at the end of 1 month , 79.5% at 90 days , 63.2% at 180 days , 51% at 1 year and 38.7% at the end of 2 years . 
 the follow - up of our patients revealed that 28 patients had died , and six from massive hemorrhage and the remainder as a result of their disease process . 
 twenty - one patients have recurrent hemoptysis after repeated bae , the volume of bleeding is < 5 ml / d , taking medicine can control the bleeding . 
 one patient suffered recurrent hemoptysis wanted to take a surgical management , but the diffuse disease in lung limited the management . 
 there was no follow - up information available on 92 patients , because they did not return after treatment and the telephone numbers were null . 
 the remaining 199 patients had follow - up periods ranging from 6 months to 8 years without evidence of recurrent hemoptysis . in summary 
 , hemoptysis represents a significant clinical entity with high morbidity and potential mortality . medical management ( in terms of resuscitation and bronchoscopic interventions ) and surgery 
 bae procedures represent the first - line treatment for hemoptysis arising from bronchial arterial source . in our study 
 , it was very useful in obtaining immediate bleeding control which was slightly better than that in other report . 
 the technique was a relatively safe and effective method for control the hemoptysis , importantly , it can be used repeatedly . in our study , 
 more than 50% patients had massive hemoptysis , about 70% patients ca nt be identified bleeding point by chest ct , 41% patients hemorrhage source from two lungs according the bronchial arteriography . 
 although the long - term outcome in some patients is not good , bae may be the only life - saving treatment option in patients who are poor surgical candidates .","background : hemoptysis is a significant clinical entity with high morbidity and potential mortality . 
 both medical management ( in terms of resuscitation and bronchoscopic interventions ) and surgery have severe limitations in these patients population . 
 bronchial artery embolization ( bae ) represents the first - line treatment for hemoptysis . 
 this article discusses clinical analysis , embolization approach , outcomes and complications of bae for the treatment of hemoptysis.methods:a retrospective analysis of 344 cases , who underwent bronchial arteriography at tianjin haihe hospital between 2006 and 2013 . 
 several aspects of outcome were analyzed : demographics , clinical presentation , radiographic studies , results , complications and follow - up of bae.results:three hundred and forty - four consecutive patients underwent bronchial arteriography , 336 of 344 patients ( 97.7% ) performed bae ; there were 1530 coils for 920 arteries embolized ; the main responsible sources for bleeding were right bronchial artery ( 29.7% ) , left bronchial artery ( 21.6% ) , combined right and left bronchial trunk ( 18.4% ) , right intercostal arteries ( 13.3% ) ; 61 patients ( 17.7% ) had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month after undergoing bae , 74 patients ( 21.5% ) had recurrent hemoptysis over 1 month after undergoing bae ; the common complications of bae included subintimal dissection , arterial perforation by a guide wire , fever , chest pain , dyspnea , etc . 
 the follow - up was completed in 248 patients , 28 patients had been dead , 21 patients still bleed , 92 patients had lost to follow-up.conclusions:the technique of bae is a relatively safe and effective method for controlling hemoptysis . 
 the complications of bae are rare . 
 although the long - term outcome in some patients is not good , bae may be the only life - saving treatment option in patients who are poor surgical candidates .",pubmed
"in denmark , women planning to conceive are advised to take a daily supplement of 400 g folic acid ( fa ) until the 12th week of gestation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects ( ntds).1 starting fa supplementation before conception is an important component of effective prevention of ntds , since the neural tube closes at gestational week 6 , only a few weeks after the pregnancy may be recognized.2 fa is primarily taken as single supplements or as a component of multivitamins ( mvs ) and other vitamin preparations made for pregnancy planners or pregnant women . despite campaigns promoting the fa recommendation in denmark in 1999 and 2001 , women in the preconceptional period appear to have neither adequate dietary intake of folate nor adequate supplementation from fa tablets or mv supplements . according to the national survey of dietary habits from 2003 to 2008 , only 510% of danish women of fertile age have a sufficient intake of dietary folate.3 the most recent data on periconceptional use of fa supplements in denmark are from the danish national birth cohort ( dnbc ) . between 2000 and 2002 
 , the proportion of fa compliers among dnbc participants who planned their pregnancy increased from 14% to only 22% , and thus remained low even after the campaigns.4,5 several retrospective studies of pregnant women in other countries also reported poor compliance , with 12% of women in the uk,6 17% in norway,7 2330% in australia8,9 and 44% in the us10 reporting fa supplement use in the preconception period . 
 in addition , a prospective cohort study reported that only 6% of the women who became pregnant within 3 months of being interviewed in a general woman s survey in the uk followed the fa recommendation.11 in previous studies , young age , low education and income , smoking , overweight , and parity were reported to be predictors of noncompliance.58,10 to date , no study has examined other health - related predictors of compliance during the preconceptional period , and we lack recent estimates of compliance with the fa recommendation reported from pregnancy planners during the preconceptional period . in the current study , we estimated the prevalence of fa and mv supplement use and identified sociodemographic , lifestyle , reproductive , and medical predictors of such use among danish pregnancy planners . 
 the present study was a cross - sectional analysis of baseline data from an internet - based prospective cohort study of danish pregnancy planners  snart - gravid ( soon pregnant).the study design has been described in detail elsewhere.12,13 briefly , the study was initiated in june 2007 . 
 participants were enrolled via the study website , and data were collected by email and self - administered questionnaires . 
 recruitment was achieved by a pop - up advertisement placed on a well - known health - related website ( http://www.netdoktor.dk ) and two press releases . before enrolment 
 , potential participants entering the study website were required to read a consent form and fill in a screening questionnaire in order to confirm eligibility . 
 further , participants were required to provide a valid email address and their personal civil registry ( cpr ) number , which is a unique ten - digit personal identification number allowing linkage to a number of nationwide registries . 
 eligible women were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire and bimonthly follow - up questionnaires for 12 months or until conception occurred , after which active follow - up ended . 
 participants were initially randomized to receive either a short- or a long - form baseline questionnaire . 
 completion rates and missing data were similar for both questionnaire versions.13 eligible women were danish residents aged 1840 years , living in a stable relationship with a male partner , not using birth control , not receiving any type of fertility treatment , and attempting to conceive for no more than 12 months . from june 1 , 2007 to august 3 , 2011 
 of these , one woman did not provide a valid cpr number in the screener , one woman was excluded because she was already pregnant ( 14 weeks ) , and 533 women were excluded because they had been attempting to conceive for more than 12 months . in total , 5383 eligible women enrolled in the study during the 4-year study period . 
 data on preconceptional use of fa and mv supplements and sociodemographic , lifestyle , reproductive , and medical variables were assessed at baseline . in the baseline questionnaire , women were asked  do you take vitamins on a regular basis  daily or almost every day ?  ,  how long have you been taking vitamins on a regular basis 
 less than one year , 15 years , more than 5 years , or do nt know ?  , and  which of the following vitamins or minerals do you take on a regular basis 
 mvs , vitamin a , beta - carotene , vitamin b , vitamin c , vitamin d , vitamin e , fa , calcium , magnesium , selenium , or other ?  participants who reported  multivitamin  or wrote the name of an mv product were defined 
 similarly , participants who reported  folic acid  or wrote  folate  were defined 
 users  were defined as women who used either fa supplements , mv supplements , or both . 
 women who used single - vitamin or mineral supplements other than fa and women who did not take any dietary supplements were defined  nonusers . 
 a total of 197 ( 3.7% ) women did not answer the initial vitamin question and were also defined as nonusers . 
 participants reported weight , height , physical activity , and smoking history in the baseline questionnaire , allowing the calculation of body mass index ( bmi ) , total metabolic equivalents ( mets ) , and pack - years of smoking . 
 bmi was calculated by dividing weight ( kg ) with height squared ( m ) . 
 mets were estimated by summing the mets from moderate and vigorous physical activity ( hours per week multiplied by 3.5 and hours per week multiplied by 7.0 , respectively).14 data on smoking were categorized as pack - years of ever - smoking where 1 pack - year was defined as smoking 20 cigarettes per day in 1 year . to assess sociodemographic predictors of compliance among pregnancy planners , we examined the association between preconceptional fa or mv supplement use and the following variables : age ( categorized as < 25 , 2529 , 3034 , and 35 years ) , schooling ( primary and lower secondary school , high school , and other ) , vocational training ( none , short [ <3 years ] , medium [ 34 years ] , and long [ > 4 years ] ) and total monthly household income ( < 12,500 , 12,50024,999 , 25,00039,999 , 40,00064,999 , and 65,000 dkk / month ) . 
 we also examined lifestyle factors that could indicate intense efforts to conceive , such as intercourse frequency ( categorized as < 1 , 13 , and 4 times per week ) and months attempting pregnancy at study entrance ( 01 , 24 , 56 , and 712 months ) . 
 furthermore , compliance with other health recommendations , such as attending the national screening program for cervical cancer ( pap smear ) during the last 3 years ( none vs one or more ) , smoking history ( never smoked , < 5 , 59 , and 10 pack - years ) , current alcohol intake ( none , 13 , 47 , 814 , and 15 
 drinks / week ) , bmi ( < 18.5 , 18.524.9 , 2529.9 , 3034.9 , and 35 kg / m ) , and engagement in physical activity ( < 10 , 1019 , 2039 , and 40 mets / week ) , were also of interest . finally , we studied the associations with previous spontaneous abortion ( yes vs no ) , parity ( nulliparous vs parous ) , and medical conditions that may increase health awareness in relation to pregnancy , which included hypertension ( yes vs no ) , diabetes ( yes vs no ) , thyroid disease ( yes vs no ) , pelvic inflammatory disease ( yes vs no ) , and infection with chlamydia ( yes vs no ) . 
 we estimated the prevalence proportion ( pp ) of fa or mv users in each level of study predictors . 
 multivariate binomial regression was used to obtain prevalence proportion differences ( ppds ) with 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) for each predictor level in relation to the reference group . 
 the multivariate analyses for the pp and ppd for each study predictor were adjusted for all other covariates . 
 stata statistical software ( version 11.2 ; college station , texas ) was used for all analyses . 
 missing values ranged between 0.1% ( schooling ) and 8.7% ( total monthly household income ) . 
 because 1540 ( 28.6% ) participants were initially randomized to receive the short - form baseline questionnaire , they did not receive the questions about hypertension , diabetes , thyroid disease , and pelvic inflammatory disease .

 we also examined lifestyle factors that could indicate intense efforts to conceive , such as intercourse frequency ( categorized as < 1 , 13 , and 4 times per week ) and months attempting pregnancy at study entrance ( 01 , 24 , 56 , and 712 months ) . 
 furthermore , compliance with other health recommendations , such as attending the national screening program for cervical cancer ( pap smear ) during the last 3 years ( none vs one or more ) , smoking history ( never smoked , < 5 , 59 , and 10 pack - years ) , current alcohol intake ( none , 13 , 47 , 814 , and 15 drinks / week ) , bmi ( < 18.5 , 18.524.9 , 2529.9 , 3034.9 , and 35 kg / m ) , and engagement in physical activity ( < 10 , 1019 , 2039 , and 40 mets / week ) , were also of interest . finally , we studied the associations with previous spontaneous abortion ( yes vs no ) , parity ( nulliparous vs parous ) , and medical conditions that may increase health awareness in relation to pregnancy , which included hypertension ( yes vs no ) , diabetes ( yes vs no ) , thyroid disease ( yes vs no ) , pelvic inflammatory disease ( yes vs no ) , and infection with chlamydia ( yes vs no ) . 
 we estimated the prevalence proportion ( pp ) of fa or mv users in each level of study predictors . 
 multivariate binomial regression was used to obtain prevalence proportion differences ( ppds ) with 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) for each predictor level in relation to the reference group . 
 the multivariate analyses for the pp and ppd for each study predictor were adjusted for all other covariates . 
 stata statistical software ( version 11.2 ; college station , texas ) was used for all analyses . missing values ranged between 0.1% ( schooling ) and 8.7% ( total monthly household income ) . because 1540 ( 28.6% ) participants were initially randomized to receive the short - form baseline questionnaire 
 , they did not receive the questions about hypertension , diabetes , thyroid disease , and pelvic inflammatory disease . 
 overall , 412 ( 7.7% ) women used fa supplements exclusively , 1100 ( 20.4% ) used mv supplements exclusively , and 1831 ( 34.0% ) used both , yielding 62.1% users . 
 a total of 82 ( 1.5% ) used single vitamins or minerals other than fa , and 1958 ( 36.4% ) did not use any dietary supplements , yielding 2040 ( 37.9% ) nonusers of fa or mv supplements ( table 1 ) . among users , 
 after mutual adjustment for covariates , higher age was associated with increased prevalence of fa or mv use ( table 2 ) . 
 our data also indicate that women who finished high school were more likely to use fa or mvs compared with women with less schooling . 
 similarly , compared with women with a long vocational training ( > 4 years ) , ppds for having no vocational training and a short ( <3 years ) vocational training were 5.7% and 7.1% , respectively , and compared with total monthly household of 65,000 dkk / month , ppd for < 12,500 dkk / month was 8.7% . while intercourse frequency  1 times / week was associated with an increased prevalence of fa or mv use , there was no clear association between months attempting to conceive at study entrance and fa or mv use . 
 furthermore , women who had pap smears once or more during the last 3 years were more likely to use fa or mv supplements compared with women who did not have pap smears ( ppd was 9.7% for none versus one or more ) . 
 kg / m ) were associated with a decreased prevalence of fa or mv use . compared with women who never smoked , 
 ppd for 10 pack - years of smoking was 11.3% . compared with no alcohol intake ppd for 15 drinks / week was 18.4% . compared with normal weight ( bmi = 18.524.9 kg / m ) , 
 ppds of fa or mv use for bmis of 3034.9 and 35 kg / m were 5.1% and 7.1% , respectively . 
 furthermore , women who engaged in physical activity were more likely to use fa or mvs than sedentary women ( < 10 mets / week ) . among women who had a previous spontaneous abortion , 
 the ppd of fa or mv use was 7.7% higher than women who did not report having a previous abortion . 
 finally , there was no clear association between being diagnosed with either hypertension , diabetes , thyroid disease , pelvic inflammatory disease , or infections with chlamydia and preconceptional fa or mv supplement use . 
 our data indicate that 62% of the 5383 pregnancy planners in this study adhere to the danish fa recommendation . by interpreting 
 users  as compliers , we may overestimate the proportion of compliers following the fa recommendation . the questionnaire provided information on whether the women took an fa or mv supplement or not , but there was no information on the exact dose of fa ingested or the brand name of the fa or mv product . in addition , 
 mv supplements have no standard definitions,1720 it can not be assumed that all mvs contained fa . however , most mvs on the danish market contain 400 g fa , especially those made for use during pregnancy . 
 the prevalence among pregnancy planners in our study is higher than the prevalence of preconception fa ( 12%44%)510 and mv use ( 11%)8 reported by pregnant women in previous studies . however , these studies collected data during the second and third trimesters , which may decrease the recall of fa and mv use during the preconceptional period . in addition , the studies were relatively small , with 588 women attending an antenatal clinic in melbourne in gestational weeks 3638,8 1541 women attending an antenatal ultrasound screening in gestational weeks 1719 in oslo,7 and 327 pregnant women calling the california teratogen information service in gestational week 13 in the us.10 consequently , prevalence estimates reported in these studies may have been imprecise . 
 the definition of compliance with the fa recommendation differs among studies . in the study by forster 
 et al,8 29% took prepregnancy fa supplements , but only 23% reported taking fa for at least 4 weeks before pregnancy . in the study by braekke and staff,7 17% of 
 this proportion may be more comparable with our findings , since some  users  in our study may have been in gestational weeks 04 at baseline . 
 women with unplanned pregnancies are less likely to use fa supplements before pregnancy . in the studies by forster 
 et al8 and goldberg et al,10 the prevalence of unplanned pregnancy was 19% and 36% , respectively . 
 these studies estimated fa use among all pregnancies ( planned and unplanned ) , making their results difficult to compare with ours . in the study by braekke and staff,7 there was no information about unplanned pregnancies or contributions of fa from mv supplements , both increasing the possibility of underestimation of the proportions of fa users in this study . in denmark , the largest and most recent study of lifestyle factors in relation to compliance with the fa recommendation was conducted among 18,294 pregnant women ( gestational weeks 1012 ) enrolled in the dnbc during 20002002.5 in this study , fa supplements were derived from single fa tablets , mv tablets , and vitamins made for pregnant or lactating women . 
 compliance was defined as taking 320 g fa per day , from 4 weeks before the date of the last menstrual period until gestation week 6 . 
 a total of 76% of the pregnancies were planned , and the overall proportion of women who complied with the recommendation was only 16% among planners . during the 10-year time period to the present study , there may have been an increase in the awareness as well as more available information about prepregnant recommendations , which may partly explain the observed increase in the prevalence of compliers with the fa recommendation found in this study . 
 in contrast to the dnbc , our data on supplement use and potential predictors were reported during the preconceptional period , and information was recorded prospectively , which increases the validity of the study . on the other hand , snart - gravid study participants may be more health - conscious than the general population of pregnancy planners , possibly overestimating the prevalence of fa or mv use . 
 even so , it is unlikely that an overestimation of supplement use would meaningfully distort the associations between predictors and fa or mv use . 
 in addition , differences in sociodemographic factors among snart - gravid study participants compared with the general population may also contribute to an overestimation of fa or mv use . 
 our study agrees with previous studies that found that maternal age,5,7,10 education,5,6,10 income,6,8 smoking,5,8 and bmi10 were associated with preconception fa use . 
 although a history of childbirth may increase awareness of preconceptional fa use , previous studies found that a previous childbirth either decreased the likelihood of fa use in subsequent pregnancies or was not related to fa use.5,7,8 we found only little association between parity and fa use in our study . 
 the positive associations between previous spontaneous abortion and intercourse frequency and fa or mv use found in our study have not been reported previously . 
 these findings may indicate a relation between a high desire to conceive and increased knowledge about the preconceptional fa guidelines . while lifestyle recommendations during pregnancy are widely available , less advice is available for women trying to conceive . 
 in addition to the fa recommendation , danish women planning a pregnancy are advised to avoid alcohol altogether.1 a total of 32% reported no alcohol intake in our study , which was slightly more than the 12% reported from the dnbc previously.21 in addition , we found the lowest proportion of fa or mv users among women with the highest alcohol intake . 
 together with the concern that excessive alcohol intake impedes the normal bioavailability and metabolism of folate,22 these results underscore the need to target women at high risk of not following the fa recommendation , as well as those not following other preconceptional guidelines . 
 being diagnosed with a chronic disease has previously been associated with increased dietary supplement use in general.23 pregnancy planners with a chronic illness might be more prone to use fa or mvs because of increased health awareness , but we found little association between a diagnosis of hypertension , diabetes , thyroid disease , pelvic inflammatory disease or infections with chlamydia and preconceptional use of fa or mvs . 
 our data indicate that 62% of the 5383 pregnancy planners in this study adhere to the danish fa recommendation . by interpreting 
 users  as compliers , we may overestimate the proportion of compliers following the fa recommendation . the questionnaire provided information on whether the women took an fa or mv supplement or not , but there was no information on the exact dose of fa ingested or the brand name of the fa or mv product . in addition , 
 mv supplements have no standard definitions,1720 it can not be assumed that all mvs contained fa . however , most mvs on the danish market contain 400 g fa , especially those made for use during pregnancy . 
 the prevalence among pregnancy planners in our study is higher than the prevalence of preconception fa ( 12%44%)510 and mv use ( 11%)8 reported by pregnant women in previous studies . however , these studies collected data during the second and third trimesters , which may decrease the recall of fa and mv use during the preconceptional period . in addition , the studies were relatively small , with 588 women attending an antenatal clinic in melbourne in gestational weeks 3638,8 1541 women attending an antenatal ultrasound screening in gestational weeks 1719 in oslo,7 and 327 pregnant women calling the california teratogen information service in gestational week 13 in the us.10 consequently , prevalence estimates reported in these studies may have been imprecise . 
 the definition of compliance with the fa recommendation differs among studies . in the study by forster 
 et al,8 29% took prepregnancy fa supplements , but only 23% reported taking fa for at least 4 weeks before pregnancy . in the study by braekke and staff,7 17% of 
 this proportion may be more comparable with our findings , since some  users  in our study may have been in gestational weeks 04 at baseline .

 uncertainty remains , however , about the prevalence of compliers and health - related predictors of compliance in the preconceptional period.methodswe used self - reported baseline data from 5383 women , aged 1840 years , enrolled in an internet - based prospective cohort study of danish pregnancy planners during 20072011 . 
 we estimated the prevalence proportions of fa or multivitamin ( mv ) use in relation to selected sociodemographic , lifestyle , reproductive , and medical characteristics . 
 multivariate binomial regression was used to obtain prevalence proportion differences with 95% confidence intervals for each level of study predictors , adjusted for all other predictors.resultsoverall , 7.7% of women used fa supplements , 20.4% used mv supplements , 34.0% used both , 1.5% used other single vitamins or minerals , and 36.4% did not use any dietary supplements . 
 the prevalence of fa or mv supplement use was higher among older women , women with higher education and income , and women with healthy lifestyle factors such as being a nonsmoker , nondrinker , physically active , maintaining a normal body mass index and having regular pap smears . 
 greater intercourse frequency and a history of spontaneous abortion were also positively associated with fa or mv supplement use . 
 we found no clear association between use of fa or mv supplements and a diagnosis of hypertension , diabetes , thyroid disease , pelvic inflammatory disease , or chlamydia.conclusiona large proportion of pregnancy planners do not use fa or mv supplements .

"substantial growth has occurred in the options for operative fracture treatment in the last few decades.1 this , in proportion to newer and better internal fixation devices or implants . 
 specially designed intramedullary ( i m ) nails , and plates and screws for every bone and even parts of bones have helped increase treatment efficacy and union rates . 
 titanium alloys and stainless steel are generally employed for the manufacture of orthopedic implants.1 after fracture union , the implant loses its purpose and continues to exist only as a foreign object inside the patient s body . 
 removal of asymptomatic hardware is still debated , and there is a lack of clear guidelines.2 although there are several presumed benefits of implant removal , like functional improvement and pain relief , the surgical procedure can be challenging and may lead to complications such as neurovascular injury and refractures.2 there is wide country to country and surgeon to surgeon variations in the viewpoint on removal of hardware , with some advocating and many opposing routine removal.3 add to this the patients demands owing to their own perceptions and fears about the  foreign device  inside their body . in children , 
 though , routine implant removal after fracture union is still standard procedure.4 implants may disturb function , and some theoretical long - term risks such as growth disturbance , foreign body reaction , chronic infection , and corrosion are used as arguments for removal . 
 however , benefits should outweigh risks and removal should not require a more extensive operation than insertion.4 the consensus dilemmas over routine implant removal in adults notwithstanding , there are circumstances when removal of hardware does become necessary . 
 these include pain and discomfort to the patient , infection and implant failure . in our center 
 we designed this short study to investigate the commonest indications of implant removal , and to detect which implants were most likely to require removal . 
 the study was conducted prospectively on patients admitted for removal of implants in the orthopedics department of a teaching hospital . 
 adult patients aged 18 years or more who presented in the outpatient department ( opd ) with hardware related problems that necessitated removal was admitted . 
 patients admitted over a period of 7-month starting february 2013 were included in the study . 
 patients who had fixation devices intended to be removed after a definite interval to begin with , like percutaneous k - wires , external fixators and tarsal screws , were not included in the study . 
 patients requiring removal of joint prostheses were also excluded from the study . at the time of admission , the potential risks of the operation and the possibility of non - favorable outcomes were explained to all patients . after admission 
 , routine inpatient investigations were performed on all patients to evaluate their fitness for surgery . 
 postoperatively , the patients were retained in the hospital for variable periods depending on the indication of removal and the condition of the wound . 
 antibiotics were continued for longer duration in patients with infected hardware . at discharge , all the patients were strictly advised to protect the extremity for a variable length of time as demanded by the bone and the implant removed . 
 they were followed in the opd for another 4 months and evaluated for symptom relief / persistence / new problems , and the data were collected . 
 the data were analyzed by the authors and also by statistician using spss software and applying t - test , and results were compiled . 
 eighty - seven patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria , but four did not return for follow - up . that left us with eighty - three patients on whom to conduct the study ( n = 83 ) . 
 seventy - one patients were males ( 85.55% ) and 12 were females ( 14.45% ) . 
 their ages ranged from 20 years to 78 years , and the mean age was 38 years . 
 the reasons for removal of implants were found to lie in five categories : pain / discomfort / prominent hardware , infected hardware , implant failure , elective ( patient s insistence ) , and other reasons ( table 1 ) . 
 distribution of cases thirty - three patients out of eighty - three had hardware pain or discomfort or prominence ( 39.75% ) . 
 they ranged in age from 20 to 60 years ( mean age 31.6 years ) . 
 the time since fracture fixation ranged from 4 months to 96 months ( average 38 months ) . 
 the implants most commonly responsible in order of frequency were patella tension band wiring ( tbw ) ( n = 8) , olecranon tbw / plates ( n = 7 ) , distal humeral plates ( n = 6 ) , and femoral i m nails ( n = 4 ) . 
 the mean duration of hospital stay in these patients was 5 days . at 4 months follow - up , 15 patients out of 34 reported complete relief of pain ( 44.11% ) . 
 the average pain visual analog scale ( vas ) score decreased from 5.2 preoperatively to 2.1 postoperatively , which was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 one had an ulnar nerve palsy postoperatively , which recovered ( chart 1 , figure 1a and b ) . 
 ( b ) radiographs before and after removal of the implants twenty - four patients out of 83 ( 28.91% ) needed hardware removal because they had developed infection at the implant site a variable duration after osteosynthesis . 
 their ages ranged from 26 years to 78 years ( mean 49.33 years ) , and the duration since first surgery varied from 2 months to 156 months ( mean 47.57 months ) . 
 one ununited fracture was managed with external fixator ; the other was an infected olecranon which required repeat debridements followed by repeat osteosynthesis and flap coverage . in this group , 
 the implants most commonly removed included distal tibial / ankle plates and screws ( n = 8) , proximal tibial plates ( n = 4 ) and olecranon plates ( n = 3 ) . 
 after the removal , infection subsided in 21 patients out of 24 ( 87.5% ) . 
 one of them had a refracture of the tibial shaft after sequestrectomy ( chart 2 ) ( figures 2 and 3 ) . 
 distribution of infected hardware exposed and infected medial plates in the distal tibia in three patients infected and failed femoral locking nail eight ( 9.52% ) patients required implant removal and revision osteosynthesis for implant failure . 
 their average age was 35 years ( 18 - 50 years ) , and the average time since the primary procedure was 7.6 months ( 2 - 12 months ) . 
 these included 3 femoral i m nails , 2 distal tibial locked plates , 1 humeral shaft dynamic compression plate , and 2 patients with cannulated cancellous screws in the femoral neck ( chart 3 , figure 4 ) . 
 distribution of failed hardware plate failure in the humeral shaft and proximal femur one patient during the routine course of his follow - up after plating of both forearm bones was found to have extensive bone resorption under the plates ( figure 5 ) . 
 these plates were removed . on follow - up , there was no fracture or other complications . 
 bone resorption beneath ulnar plate seventeen ( 20.48% ) patients had their implants removed on demand , despite being asymptomatic . 
 during the course of their follow - up , three of these had persistent pain at the operated site . 
 two developed superficial wound infections which prolonged their hospital stay but responded to intravenous antibiotics and wound lavage . 
 distribution of implants removed on patient s wish the most consistently encountered obstacle during surgery was difficulty in removing the hardware from the bone . 
 this was seen especially in locked plates of the distal humerus and forearm , with ingrowth of bone around the plate / screws . 
 loss of contour (  rounding  ) of the screw head slot was also commonly encountered preventing the engagement of the driver in the screw head . 
 screw heads had to be cutoff to remove the plate in two patients because of this complication , and the shank left in the bone . in one patient who had presented for elective removal of an interlocked tibial nail , we failed to extract the nail despite best efforts . in another patient with a painful femoral nail , 
 fortunately , we did not encounter any major vascular injury or iatrogenic fracture during the removal of any implant . 
 one patient had an ulnar nerve neuropraxia after removal of distal humeral plates , which recovered . 
 sequestrectomy was done , and the patient presented with a refracture in follow - up . 
 these last two , and persistent pain in three previously asymptomatic patients were the only true complications in our series . 
 femoral interlocking nail broken during removal overall , the most frequently removed implants in our series were distal tibial / ankle plates ( 14.45% of implants removed ) , femoral i m nails ( 13.25% ) , olecranon wires and plates ( 12.04% ) , and tibial i m nails and patellar tbws ( 9.53% each ) . 
 pertinent to mention though that 6 of the 8 tibial nail removals were elective ( asymptomatic patients ) ( chart 5 ) . 
 overall distribution of removed implants all implants except one removed in our series were made of stainless steel , and all were made by indian manufacturers . 
 the issue of removing metallic implants used in fracture fixation has been oft discussed , and at length . 
 popular opinion probably still is that implant removal should not be considered a routine procedure.2,3,5 although the ao - association for the study of internal fixation has published recommendations on the timing of hardware removal in recent fractures with uncomplicated healing ( table 2 ) , the clinical indications for implant removal are not well established , and few definitive data exist to guide whether routine implant removal is appropriate . 
 furthermore , the surgical procedures for implant removal are fraught with risks of fracture , neurovascular injury , and infection . 
 various arguments have been made from time to time to justify removal of hardware after fracture union , e.g. , metal allergy , corrosion , carcinogenesis and metal ion toxicity , but for none has concrete proof been produced.2 all the same , a lot of metal is removed from human bones every day . and 
 that depicts that hardware does need to be removed in a significant subset of patients . 
 large studies on implant removal in symptomatic patients are lacking , though many patients get their implants removed for one reason or another . 
 our endeavor was to document the common indications for removal of internal fixation devices and highlight potential issues , even as most specialists are already well versed with them . 
 timing of implant removal in uncomplicated fracture healing ; ao guidelines we found that majority of patients that needed removal of implant were men ( 85.5% ) . 
 shrestha et al . in their retrospective series also found a male preponderance ( 189 out of 275 patients ) to the tune of 68.72%.6 their study , however , also included children . 
 30 of these ( 75% ) were males.7 there definitely seems to be a strong male preponderance in implant removal surgeries . 
 the mean age of patients requiring removal for infection was higher ( 49.33 years ) than those with pain ( 31.6 years ) or implant failure ( 35 years ) . 
 in our study , implant associated pain or discomfort was the most common reason necessitating removal ( 39.75% ) . 
 brown et al . found that 31% patient sunder going open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures had persistent lateral pain.8 they also found that only 11 of 22 patients who got their hardware removed had improvement in the pain . 
 prospectively studied 60 patients who had implant removal for hardware pain , and at 1 year follow - up all their patients were satisfied.9 although we did not primarily aim to evaluate the outcome after removal , all our patients had at least some relief in their hardware pain at 4 months follow - up . 
 the next most common indication in our series was implant infection ( about 29% ) . 
 some of these patients had been treated non - operatively for varying lengths of time to control the infection but without success . 
 others presented for the first time at such a stage , e.g. , skin necrosis , that removing the implant was the only logical option . 
 trampuz and widmer estimated that overall about 5% of all internal fixation devices become infected.10 they also impressed the role of biofilms in the resistance of pathogens to systemically administered antibiotics . 
 only one was a delayed infection ( 2 - 10 weeks ) , a woman with an olecranon plate who developed skin necrosis and the plate had to be removed 2 months after surgery . 
 all the others were  late  infections , caused by constant hematogenous seeding of the implant from skin , respiratory , dental and urogenital infections . 
 the incidence of infections is likely to rise as more operations are performed by the day , and longevity increases translating into greater periods of possible bacterial implant seeding in the body . 
 trampuz and widmer recommended stoppage of any antibiotics 2 weeks before the removal surgery , if possible , to get an accurate intraoperative tissue culture . 
 they also suggested that the removed implant be sonicated in saline to dislodge microorganisms from its surface and the resultant sonicated fluid be sent for microbiologic examination . 
 kukla et al . in a study of implants removed from the proximal femur ( dynamic hip screw and gamma nails ) found that the most common indications were avascular necrosis of the femoral head , deep chronic infections , shaft fractures , and screw cut - out.11 implant failure was the next most common indication in our series in symptomatic patients but it was less common than those in whom the hardware was removed at the patient s behest . 
 reasons for failure of the implant include faulty implant ( poor quality ) , faulty operative technique , inadequate implant , delayed healing , and patient noncompliance . 
 akhtar et al . cited the most common cause of failure as poor quality of the implant.12 peivandi et al . 
 they recommended that credible and trusted implant brands should be used in fracture fixation.13 sharma et al . in a restrospective study of 41 failed upper and lower limb implants found that plate failure was more common than nail failure in the lower limb.14 in most cases in their series , the patient had a significant re - trauma causing failure of the implant . 
 several studies have been carried out on the indications of removal of metalwork in asymptomatic patients . although most authors agree that routine removal should not be practiced 
 , they also agree that there is a need for the development of concrete indication guidelines for implant removal . at the same time 
 , there is a paucity of literature assessing the relative frequency of the  usual  indications of implant removal , viz . 
 we believe that routine removal in asymptomatic patients should not be practiced , and if at all necessary , the removal should not require a larger procedure than the index operation . 
 we also agree that implant removal surgeries are fraught with risks , including fractures , bleeding , nerve injuries and infection , and should be done only after explaining to the patient the possibility of all these complications . 
 in addition to the possible new problems , the removal surgery may not entirely fulfill the intended purpose , e.g. , the pain may not completely go away , infection may not resolve , and additional surgeries may be required . 
 all these factors must be borne in mind before embarking on such a process with high hopes of success . 
 our study is limited by a small sample size and a short follow - up period . 
 this may falsely favor titanium implants , although the probable reason for this is the low affordability of patients catered to by our center . 
 more studies with greater number of cases and wider study dimensions are needed to produce concrete literature on the patterns of removal surgeries in symptomatic implants . 
 we found that pain and implant prominence ( mechanical symptoms ) are the most common indications . 
 other indications are implant failure , bone resorption due to excessive stress shielding and patient s will . 
 the average age of patients requiring removal for infection is higher than that for other reasons . 
 carefully done , the removal should be a safe procedure , and there is a low but definite possibility of complications . 
 several factors like bone ingrowth and wear of the implant may make its removal difficult .","introduction : fracture fixation has become advanced with the advent of new and custom metal implants for each type of bone / fracture . after union 
 though , the implant ceases to be important and may be removed . 
 routine removal is advocated by some and opposed by others . 
 nevertheless , some patients require removal of the hardware because of various implant - related problems . 
 our study was aimed at identifying the most common causes for implant removal.objective:to investigate the common indications of orthopedic implant removal surgeries.methods:adult patients admitted for implant removal in our department were included in the study . 
 they were operated in the next ot list . 
 they were then followed for an average 4 months for resolutions of symptoms or appearance of new problems.results:a total of 83 patients were studied . 
 71 of them were males . 
 the mean age was 38 years . 
 the reasons for removal of implants were found to lie in five categories : pain / discomfort / prominent hardware , infected hardware , implant failure , elective ( patient s insistence ) , and other reasons . 
 overall , the most frequently removed implants in our series were distal tibial / ankle plates ( 14.45% of implants removed ) , femoral intramedullary ( i m ) nails ( 13.25% ) , olecranon wires and plates ( 12.04% ) , and tibial i m nails and patellar tension band wirings ( 9.53% each).discussion and conclusion : the clinical indications of implant removal are not well established , and few definitive data exist to guide whether routine implant removal is appropriate .

"the role of endoscopic injection of dextranomer / hyaluronic acid copolymer ( dx / ha ) has expanded , as an alternative to open surgery , to a treatment option for observation protocols using prophylactic antibiotics . 
 deflux has been fda approved since 2001 as a treatment option for grade 24 vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) in single systems with no accompanying urological malformations in children above one year of age . 
 the operative ease of technique , short procedure , and recovery time as well as repeatability of injections have popularized the technique with surgeons and parents alike . 
 reports of expanded use to patients of all ages and grades of vur even in the presence of duplication , ureterocele , or other lower tract anomalies are published worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] .   in a statement of the aua board of directors from october 2007 
 , it was determined that :  it is the current position of the american urological association that endoscopic injection of the dextranomer / hyaluronic compound deflux is an option in the management of pediatric vesicoureteral reflux ( vur )  [ 3 , 4 ] . 
 the initial success rate was quoted as 68%   and is still mentioned on the current website   of the manufacturing company ( q - med , scandinavia inc ) . in the meantime , the original subureteric injection technique ( sting ) has evolved to the intraureteric injection technique introduced by the atlanta group . using this hydrodistention - implantation technique ( hit ) , the authors reported success rates of 89% . 
 however , the reported worldwide success rates differ considerably ( 55%89% [ 7 , 8 ] ) . unpublished data from our institution show an overall radiographic success rate of 75% for patients and 84% for renal units after the first injection . 
 although the success rates continuously improve , the numbers of most institutions still differ significantly from the traditional 98% for open reimplants . since up to 25% of patients will have remaining vur after dx / ha injection , we still perform voiding cystograms 2 months after surgery . 
 positional instillation of contrast ( pic ) cystography was developed to detect occult vur in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections ( uti ) after a negative standard voiding cystogram . 
 it has a higher sensitivity than standard voiding cystogram ( vcug ) and can detect occult vur . 
 parents can be advised that in case of a positive pic , dx / ha injection can be performed during the same anesthesia . in the current study , we compared two different pic techniques and evaluated two different scenarios : first , whether pic cystography or high - pressure cystograms were useful to detect de novo contralateral vur in the case of preoperative unilateral vur and second , whether pic cystography , when performed intraoperatively immediately after dx / ha injection , can predict a successful surgical outcome by correlating the results with a standard 2-month postprocedure vcug . 
 a retrospective chart review was performed on all intraoperative cystograms performed at the time of dx / ha injections at our institution from 20052007 . 
 dx / ha injections were performed for all grades of vur and included complex cases such as duplicated systems . in case of preoperative unilateral reflux , a pic cystogram was performed on the contralateral unaffected side before dx / ha injection . if positive , bilateral injection took place . 
 the injections were done using the hit technique as described by kirsch et al . . 
 dx / ha was injected until a sufficient mound and good ureteral coaptation was observed . at this point 
 the outflow portion of the 10 french off set cystoscope ( wolf , germany ) was placed at the bladder neck filling the bladder with contrast material ( cystografin ) to 100  cm water pressure until voiding occurred around the cystoscope ensuring complete bladder filling . 
 the second group underwent standard pic cystography   with the outflow portion of the cystoscope directed at the ureteral orifice at a 100  cm water pressure for 5 seconds ( figure 2 ) . 
 radiographic views for both tests were performed in anterior - posterior and lateral as well as upper tract views . 
 the intraoperative cystogram was noted to be positive if any grade of vur was present ( figure 3 ) . in cases of a positive study on the contralateral side or for remaining vur after injection , 
 the patients were left on prophylactic antibiotics and followed up at 4 weeks postoperatively with an ultrasound and 2 months postoperatively with a vcug . 
 the correlations of the intra- and postoperative study as well as the detection of de novo vur were noted . 
 altogether 116 patients and 177 renal units ( ru ) were treated and available for evaluation . out of the 116 patients , 
 new contralateral vur ( de novo ) for the 34 preoperative unilateral refluxing patients was found intraoperatively in 27 ru ( figure 4(c ) ) . 
 the high - pressure intraoperative cystogram ( group 1 ) was performed in 86 rus and the standard pic ( group 2 ) in 91 rus . 
 there was no statistically significant difference between groups 1 and 2 for the detection of de novo vur ( figure 4(b ) ) .   for both groups , 
 only 5 ru were found to have remaining vur intraoperatively after dx / ha injection ( 2 in group 1 and 3 in group 2 ) . 
 postoperative pain management , if necessary , consisted of ibuprofen or acetaminophen according to parental preference . in all patients , 
 the postoperative us at four weeks were negative for hydronephrosis or any other new abnormality . 
 the dx / ha deposits were seen in the bladder in all cases . at 2 months 
 postoperative standard vcug detected 20 ru ( 23% ) to be positive for vur in group 1 and 16 ru ( 18% ) positive for vur in group 2 . 
 altogether 36 ru were positive , for an allover success rate of 80% for ru and 75% for patients ( figure 4(a ) ) . 
 the grade of vur , age and gender of patient as well as amount of deflux injected did not influence the result . 
 vesicoureteral reflux remains a common disease , and especially for lower grades the prospect of spontaneous resolution is good . 
 but , the data on the value of daily prophylactic antibiotics remain controversial , and most parents are concerned about their long - term use . 
 the discussion becomes evident by the current multi - institutional nih - funded rivur study , which aims to evaluate the role of prophylactic antibiotic in vur . 
 in addition to prolonged antibiotic use , parents and patients alike dread the yearly necessary voiding cystogram to check for resolution . 
 therefore , to avoid the daily antibiotics and the yearly vcug , many parents consider surgical treatment options . 
 the endoscopic injection of dx / ha is an attractive management alternative for parents . when presenting the surgical options , all parents are enthusiastic about the minimal invasive nature of the procedure with low complication possibilities and fast recovery times . 
 however , the 20%25% lower success rate of the endoscopic procedure in comparison to the open surgery is a concern . 
 although dx / ha can be reinjected , it requires further testing , anesthesia , and time spent away from school or work . 
 therefore , it would be highly desirable to develop a method to check the success of the deflux injection intraoperatively . 
 pic cystography is used to detect occult vur in patients with a negative standard voiding study who suffer from recurrent utis . according to rubenstein 
 , the procedure is a 100% sensitive and 91% specific in identifying vur and can , therefore , detect occult vur . 
 recently confirmed the findings in 5 patients . in a study on 39 patients with febrile utis and negative voiding studies from 4 different institutions , 
 pic cystograms were performed and vur identified in 82% of these patients . additionally , the authors noted that orifices that were patulous , laterally displaced , or positive for hydrodistention were much more likely to be positive for vur than normal orifices . 
 also performed intraoperative pic cystograms and found that 23% of patients had a positive , postoperative vcug despite a negative intraoperative pic study , and palmer confirmed these results . 
 the authors concluded that pic cystography was not useful to raise the success rate of deflux injection .   in the current study , we used two different cystogram techniques : the standard pic study and a high - pressure cystogram , filling the bladder until irrigation fluid leaked around the cystoscope . 
 even with this aggressive cystogram technique only an 80% correlation between a negative intraoperative cystogram and postoperative cystogram was achieved . 
 the success rate of 75% for patients and 80% for ru could not be improved . 
 a relative wound edema might increase the coaptation of the ureteral orifice , temporarily giving a negative intraoperative study result . 
 other possibilities include decrease in the size of the injected dx / ha deposit over time , also thought to be responsible for long - term failure after dx / ha injection . 
 this phenomenon has been noted during cystoscopy at the time of the planned second injection of deflux after initial failure . 
 the dx / ha deposits tend to migrate medially and toward the bladder neck causing long - term failure of injection . 
 elmore et al . reported the onset of new contralateral vur after dx / ha implantation in approximately 13% of 126 patients with preoperatively unilateral vur . in the current study , 
 twenty seven of these 34 patients demonstrated a positive pic cystography intraoperatively and were successfully injected with dx / ha . 
 none of these de novo detected refluxing units were positive for vur in the postoperative cystograms . 
 a negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative vcug in only 80% . considering that the success rates of dx / ha injections are commonly between 7580% 
 , the addition of intraoperative cystograms can not replace postoperative studies . in patients treated with unilateral vur 
 , pic cystography can detect occult reflux and prevent postoperative contralateral new onset of vur .","the endoscopic injection of dx / ha in the management of vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) has become an accepted alternative to open surgery . in the current study we evaluated the value of cystography to detect de novo contralateral vur in unilateral cases of vur at the time of dx / ha injection and correlated the findings of immediate post - dx / ha injection cystography during the same anesthesia to 2-month postoperative vcug to evaluate its ability to predict successful surgical outcomes . the current study aimed to evaluate whether an intraoperatively performed cystogram could replace postoperative studies . but 
 a negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative study in only 80% . considering the 7580% success rate of dx / ha implantation 
 , the addition of intraoperative cystograms can not replace postoperative studies . in patients treated with unilateral vur 
 , pic cystography can detect occult vur and prevent postoperative contralateral new onset of vur .",pubmed
"lung cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed and the most common cause of cancer - related death among both men and women in the united states ( us ) . 
 the american cancer society estimates that in 2012 , 226,160 patients ( men , 116,470 ; women , 109,690 ) will be diagnosed with lung cancer and 160,340 ( men , 87,750 ; women , 72,590 ) will die from the disease . 
 lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease , as early - stage disease is often asymptomatic . 
 the stage distribution of lung cancer cases diagnosed in 1999 - 2006 included in the surveillance , epidemiology and end results ( seer ) program were : distant metastasis at diagnosis , 56% ; regional metastasis , 22% ; localized , 15% ; and unstaged , 8% . 
 stage of disease was a strong risk factor for survival , with advanced disease having much lower five - year survival compared to early disease . from 1999 - 2006 , the seer program reported that the five - year relative survival was 3.5% for distant stage at diagnosis , 24% for regional stage and 52.9% for localized stage . 
 bone is one of the most frequent sites of metastasis in patients with lung cancer . 
 these osteolytic lesions undermine the structural integrity of bone placing lung cancer patients at an increased risk for skeletal - related events ( sres ) such as pathological fractures , spinal cord compression and severe pain requiring radiotherapy or surgery for bone lesions.[68 ] these skeletal complications result in impaired mobility and reduced quality of life adding substantially to the overall burden of disease in patients with lung cancer . 
 data are limited on the occurrence and outcomes of bone metastasis and sres among elderly patients who develop lung cancer . 
 a few studies have reported results pertaining to the occurrence of bone metastasis and of sres among lung cancer patients with bone metastases , but none have focused on older patients . 
 we therefore undertook this study to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and sres on mortality among older lung cancer patients by analyzing a combined population - based cancer registry and the medicare claims database . 
 the seer program , supported by the national cancer institute ( nci ) , collects cancer incidence and survival data from population - based cancer registries from selected geographic areas . during the time period of the present study , 
 the seer program covered 14 to 26% of the us population from 9 to 13 geographic areas . 
 the seer data included information on patient demographics , date of cancer diagnosis , tumor stage and other characteristics at diagnosis and summary information on treatments received soon after diagnosis . 
 the medicare program , administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services , covers 97% of us population ages 65 years . 
 medicare data included demographic information on beneficiaries and claims data from hospitals and other institutional and non - institutional providers . 
 the medicare claims data included dates of service , diagnosis codes ( international classification of diseases ninth revision ( icd-9 ) ) and procedure codes ( current procedural terminology ( cpt ) . 
 we identified a cohort of patients aged 65 years or older and having a seer record of a new diagnosis of lung cancer between july 1 , 1999 and december 31 , 2005 and used seer and medicare data to determine possible occurrence of bone metastasis , sres and deaths occurring through december 31 , 2006 . 
 we required each subject to have a baseline period of at least six months of full fee - for - service medicare coverage before his / her lung cancer diagnosis date . 
 the claims data from this baseline period provided information on the presence of comorbidities , and on the presence of possible bone metastasis and sres at diagnosis ( based on icd-9 codes ) . 
 we excluded patients who did not have both medicare part a and part b coverage and those who were enrolled in a medicare advantage plan during the baseline period because we did not have complete medicare claims data on the services they may have received . in all analyses , we censored subjects if they died or lost full fee - for - service coverage before the end of 2006 ( e.g. , if their coverage changed such that we did not have access to all of their medical claims ) . 
 bone metastasis , with or without evidence of sres , was the time - dependent exposure variable of main interest in our analyses . throughout this paper , we apply the term 
 bone metastasis  and  sres  to patients who have claims - based evidence of these conditions . 
 we used the following medicare claims data as evidence of bone metastasis : a ) at least one inpatient claim with an icd-9 diagnosis code of 198.5 (  secondary malignant neoplasm of bone and bone marrow  ) as the primary or secondary discharge diagnosis ; b ) at least one outpatient claim with a diagnosis code of 198.5 , paired with a code for procedures used to diagnose or treat bone metastasis ; or c ) at least one outpatient physician evaluation and management claim with a diagnosis code of 198.5 ( above algorithm available on request ) . 
 we classified subjects as having concurrent bone metastasis at the time of diagnosis if they had a claim in the month of the lung cancer diagnosis or in the preceding month . among subjects without concurrent bone metastasis at diagnosis , we identified new bone metastasis as the earliest occurrence of one of the above claims patterns at any time during follow - up . for the purpose of this study , we defined sres as one or more of the following conditions , occurring concurrently with or after the first bone metastasis : fractures , radiotherapy to bone , surgery to bone and spinal cord compression . 
 we identified sres using combinations of diagnosis and procedure codes from inpatient and/or outpatient claims ( codes available on request ) . 
 we classified an sre as concurrent with bone metastasis if it occurred within 30 days before or after the earliest bone metastasis date and as subsequent to bone metastasis if it occurred at any time more than 30 days after the bone metastasis date . 
 we excluded from the analysis patients with claims suggesting bone metastases occurring more than 30 days prior to the lung cancer diagnosis ( n = 570 ) . 
 the excluded patients comprising of 2% of overall patients with bone metastases had similar demographic characteristics as the bone metastases patients included in the analysis but were more likely to have unstaged and unspecified histology . 
 we obtained information on date of death using the combined seer registry and medicare claims data . 
 we used the concordant date of death in these two sources , if there was agreement between them . 
 if the seer date of death was missing , we used the medicare date of death . from the seer data 
 , we obtained information on age , gender , race / ethnicity and stage at cancer diagnosis . from the medicare claims data 
 we computed each person 's charlson comorbidity score on the basis of icd-9 diagnosis codes in his / her inpatient records for the 17 medical conditions [ table 1 ] comprising the charlson index in the 12-month period prior to the month of cancer diagnosis . in computing the charlson index , 
 we used the approach described by romano et al , and updated by quan et al . 
 characteristics of patients with lung cancer , total cohort and according to bone metastasis status : seermedicare , july 1 , 1999-december 31 , 2006 descriptive analyses of the cohort included frequency distributions and median values , where applicable . 
 we computed the proportion of patients with lung cancer having claims - based evidence of bone metastasis at one year from diagnosis for the overall cohort of lung cancer cases and for subgroups specified by tumor stage at diagnosis . 
 for these computations , we selected patients diagnosed with lung cancer from july 1 , 1999 through december 31 , 2005 , so that these patients would have a potential observation period of at least one year post lung cancer diagnosis . 
 we used cox regression to estimate mortality hazards ratios ( hrs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) among patients with bone metastasis with or without sres , compared to patients without bone metastasis , adjusting for covariates . 
 we also estimated mortality hrs for subgroups specified by initial tumor stage , age , gender and race / ethnicity at cancer diagnosis . 
 confounders were categorical forms of age at cancer diagnosis ( 65 - 69 , 70 - 74 , 75 - 79 , 80 - 84 , 85 + ) , gender ( male , female ) , race ( white , african american , hispanic american , other ) , stage at lung cancer diagnosis ( distant , localized , regional , unstaged ) , and charlson comorbidity score ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 + ) .

 the overall cohort of 126,123 patients were predominantly white ( 85% ) with a median age at diagnosis of 75 years and a median follow - up of 0.6 years [ table 1 ] . 
 eighty - one percent of patients had non - small cell lung cancer . during the study period , 24,820 ( 19.8% ) patients 
 had claims - based evidence of bone metastasis either concurrently with the diagnosis of lung cancer diagnosis ( n = 9,523 ) or during follow - up ( n = 15,297 ) . 
 the median time from cancer diagnosis to bone metastasis was 5.4 months among patients without a bone metastasis at diagnosis . 
 patients with , compared to those without , a bone metastasis were more likely to have distant stage disease ( 72% vs. 41% ) and to have died by the end of the study period ( 95% vs. 82% ) [ table 1 ] . 
 the two groups ( patients with and without bone metastasis ) were similar with regard to age , race / ethnicity , gender , year of diagnosis , histology , comorbidity score and length of follow - up .

 proportion of 126,123 patients with lung cancer who had evidence of bone metastasis within 1 year by stage of the 24,820 patients with a possible bone metastasis , 12,665 ( 51% ) had evidence of a concurrent ( n = 11,015 , 44% ) or subsequent ( n = 1,650 , 7% ) sre ( data not displayed in a table ) . among the 12,665 patients with an sre , most ( n = 10,598 , 84% ) presented with only one skeletal complication at the first diagnosis of an sre . of the 10,598 presenting with a single skeletal complication , 8,357 ( 79% ) had radiotherapy to bone , 1,509 ( 14% ) experienced a fracture , 645 ( 6% ) had spinal cord compression and 87 ( 1% ) had surgery to bone . 
 of 12,665 patients with sre , 2,067 ( 16% ) had more than one skeletal complication at the first diagnosis of an sre .

 regardless of whether it was an sre by itself or in combination with other sres , 1,625 ( 65% ) had a fracture coded as pathological . 
 the most common site of pathological fracture was the spine ( n = 991 ) , followed by hip ( n = 290 ) , femur ( n = 185 ) , humerus ( n = 141 ) , tibia / fibula ( n = 14 ) , and distal radius / ulna ( n = 4 ) .

 hrs for death among men and women were also similar with regard to bone metastasis ( men , hr = 2.4 , 95% ci = 2.4 - 2.5 ; women , hr = 2.5 , 95% ci = 2.4 - 2.5 ) . 
 we found a positive association between bone metastasis and with bone metastasis complicated with sre and mortality in all categories of age groups ( 65 - 69 , 70 - 74 , 75 - 79 , 80 - 84 , 85 + ) . 
 we found that about 19.8% of patients 65 years or older with newly diagnosed lung cancer included in the seer program from july 1999 to december 2005 presented with or subsequently had evidence of a possible bone metastasis as indicated by medicare claims . 
 sres were common , occurring in 51% of these patients . among patients with a potential follow - up time of one year post lung cancer diagnosis , the proportion with bone metastasis was 21% overall and 38% for distant stage of lung cancer . having a possible bone metastasis was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer ; the association was similar for bone metastasis complicated with an sre and for bone metastasis without an sre . 
 the skeleton is a frequent site of metastasis in patients with non - small - cell lung cancer which is the most common type of lung cancer . 
 about 85% of lung cancer cases included in the seer program have a non - small cell histology . in our data , 
 bone metastasis may be asymptomatic at onset and thus , are likely to be under - diagnosed resulting in inaccurate staging of lung cancer at diagnosis . 
 studies report that the prevalence of bone metastasis among patients who report bone pain is almost similar to patients who did not report bone pain ( 27 - 32% vs. 16 - 27% ) . prior to 1991 , 
 several studies found skeletal metastases in non - small cell lung cancer to range from 8% to 34%.[2531 ] with the advent of newer imaging techniques such as the positron emission tomography ( pet ) in the 1990s , bone metastasis has been noted to range from 24% to 30% for non - small cell lung cancer . 
 the preceding results are consistent with our finding that 21% of medicare non - small cell lung cancer patients had possible bone metastasis within a year of lung cancer diagnosis . 
 , the seer program reports that 56% of lung cancer patients were classified as having distant stage at the time of disease diagnosis . in the present study , 
 bone metastases are common in patients with distant stage of lung cancer . in the present study 
 , we found that 38% of patients with distant stage lung cancer had possible bone metastasis within a year of their cancer diagnosis . 
 this result is consistent with findings from other studies which have reported that 30 - 40% of lung cancer patients with distant metastatic disease had a bone metastasis at diagnosis or subsequently developed a bone metastasis . 
 in addition , autopsies of patients dying of lung cancer indicated that up to 30 - 40% had evidence of metastatic bone disease . in the present study 
 , we found that 51% of patients with possible bone metastasis had one or more sres . 
 this result agrees with findings from a retrospective observational study using data from a health insurance claims database in the us which reported that sres occurred in 55% of 534 lung cancer patients with bone metastasis . 
 clinical trials of lung cancer have found that sres occurred in 48% to 50% of patients with bone metastasis . in our study , 
 radiotherapy ( 81% of patients with sre ) to bone was the most common sre followed by fracture , spinal cord compression and surgery to bone . 
 we observed that among patients with fractures , 65% ( or 13% of patients with sre ) had a pathological fracture with the spine as the most common site of occurrence followed by pelvis and extremities . 
 other studies report that 7 - 10% of non - small lung cancer patients with sres developed pathological fractures . 
 our results indicated that having a bone metastasis was associated with mortality among lung cancer patients . 
 the lack of an additional effect of sre on mortality among patients with bone metastasis may be due to the short survival time in lung cancer patients compared to other tumor types . 
 our companion studies of breast and prostate cancer , cancers with relatively longer survival time , found stronger associations for bone metastasis complication by sre than for bone metastasis without sre . 
 our finding of a stronger association of bone metastasis and for bone metastasis complicated with sre for patients with localized stage lung cancer than for those with distant metastatic lung cancer at diagnosis may reflect the low mortality among patients with early stage disease and no bone metastasis . 
 the strengths of the study include the use of the large population - based seer cancer registry data with pathologically confirmed cancer and the focus on lung cancer in the elderly . the combined cancer registry and medicare data provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the clinical progress of lung cancer . 
 other advantages of the seer data include the continuity of data over time and the quality control measures instituted to ensure completeness of case ascertainment in the participating cancer registries . 
 the main limitations of our study stem from the characteristics of the seer - medicare data . 
 our study was limited to patients aged 65 years or older diagnosed with lung cancer between 1999 and 2005 , who had medicare part a and b coverage and who resided in one of the seer geographic areas . 
 medicare data do not include claims of health maintenance organization enrollees , care provided in other settings like the veterans administration , reimbursement of covered services not captured by the medicare data such as out - of - pocket expenditures or coverage provided by medigap , or long term care at home or nursing homes . 
 therefore , our results will not be generalizable to patients less than 65 years of age and may not represent patients aged 65 years and older who resided in geographic areas not included in the seer program who had only had medicare part a coverage or who were enrolled in medicare advantage plan . 
 second , we have not validated the procedures used to identify bone metastasis in this study . 
 we identified possible bone metastasis from inpatient claims or outpatient claims paired with selected procedure codes , an approach designed to reduce false positives . despite this approach 
 it is also possible that we may have missed true cases in instances where claims were not obtained from the relevant facilities or where claims were obtained but not coded as bone metastasis . 
 third , it is possible that the mortality differences we noted for bone metastasis or bone metastasis plus sre compared to those without these outcomes may be due to other confounding factors such as treatment factors or concurrent comorbid conditions that were not included in our analysis . 
 finally , the data do not include information on functional status of patients , a predictor of outcomes . 
 in conclusion , the present study found that having a bone metastasis as indicated by medicare claims , was associated with mortality among patients with lung cancer . 
 we found no difference in mortality between patients with bone metastasis complicated by sre and patients with bone metastasis but without sre .","background : to quantify the impact of bone metastasis and skeletal - related events ( sres ) on mortality among older patients with lung cancer.materials and methods : using the linked surveillance , epidemiology and end results - medicare database , we identified patients aged 65 years or older diagnosed with lung cancer between july 1 , 1999 and december 31 , 2005 and followed them to determine deaths through december 31 , 2006 .

"myosin va ( myova ) is a processive molecular motor   involved in intracellular cargo transport along the actin cytoskeleton [ 2 , 3 ] . 
 each dimerized molecule consists of a pair of n - terminal motor domains ( i.e. , heads ) connected to lever arms , followed by a coiled - coil rod domain , ending in a globular c - terminal cargo - binding domain . 
 myova 's directed movement is accomplished by a conformational change in the motor domain following atp hydrolysis [ 5 , 6 ] . 
 this motion is amplified by the lever arms , resulting in the motor 's processive motion as each head takes 72  nm steps in a hand - over - hand fashion [ 79 ] . 
 each lever arm consists of six tandem -helix motifs , stabilized by calmodulin or calmodulin - like light chains . 
 calcium is required to activate the atpase activity of myova ; however in the presence of high calcium ( > 1  m ) , motor processivity is reduced   and one or more calmodulins may dissociate from each lever arm . 
 calmodulin dissociation may render the lever arm highly compliant , which could reduce the efficiency of both the lever arm displacement amplification and the strain - dependent gating between the two heads , which are necessary for the motor 's processivity . 
 single myova are adept at maneuvering through actin intersections and traveling along actin bundles in vitro [ 1417 ] . 
 myova must have sufficient structural flexibility to permit the unbound leading head to undergo a broad diffusive search [ 7 , 1820 ] , allowing myova to switch actin tracks even when the angle between intersecting actin filaments is ~150 . 
 the structural domains that are critical to myova 's maneuverability have yet to be determined but may reside within the lever arms or at the lever arm / coiled - coil junction . 
 here we used tethered particle microscopy ( tpm ) to directly measure the flexural stiffness of individual myova motors and their subdomains . 
 tpm has been used extensively to characterize the contour length of dna tethers [ 2225 ] . 
 tpm has additionally been coupled with monte carlo simulations of nanoparticles attached to wormlike chain tethers to estimate , with high precision , the persistence length ( a measure of flexural stiffness ) of double - stranded dna . 
 our utilization of tpm involved anchoring a myova - actin complex to a microscope slide and then attaching a visible particle ( i.e. , fluorescent quantum dot ( qdot ) ) to a desired location along the motor . 
 thermal energy caused the qdot to be randomly displaced within bounds defined by the length and stiffness of the effective tether ( i.e. , the myova ) . 
 the resulting motion was measured by comparing the difference in apparent image size of the tethered qdot to a stationary , reference qdot , both of which are viewed over a long ( ~2.5  s ) exposure time [ 24 , 25 ] . while a qdot held in a fixed location has an apparent image size ( sr ) which is dependent on its diffraction limited point spread function , tethered qdots will appear larger ( st ) depending on the length and flexibility of the tether ( figure 1 ) . by attaching qdots to expressed myova constructs of different lengths ( figure 2 ) , we isolated the contributions of individual structural domains , for example , the lever arm and rod domain , to the overall flexibility and flexural stiffness of the myova molecule . 
 in addition , we hypothesized that calmodulin disassociation from the myova lever arm decreases the lever arm 's flexural stiffness , thus contributing to the motor 's compromised processivity in the presence of calcium . 
 various myova constructs , listed as follows , were expressed in the baculovirus / sf9 cell system and purified as described previously . 
 these constructs allowed the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains to be defined by tpm ( figure 2 ) . 
 full - length murine myova ( myova - fl ) was expressed as was a double - headed short construct ( myova - hmm ) , engineered by truncating the myova - fl heavy chain at residue 1098 , followed by a biotin tag and a flag epitope tag at the c - terminus to facilitate purification [ 14 , 28 ] . 
 double - headed myova constructs were coexpressed with calcium - insensitive calmodulin ( camall ) as described previously . 
 single - headed myova ( myova - s1 ) was truncated at amino acid 908 with a biotin tag at the c - terminal end and coexpressed with wild - type calmodulin and purified as described . 
 the myova - s1 and its wild - type calmodulins are sensitive to calcium in that calmodulin(s ) will dissociate from the lever arm in the presence of calcium in the solution . 
 the biotin tag is an 88-amino - acid segment from the escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein , which was biotinylated at a single lysine residue ( located 35 amino acids from the c - terminus ) during expression in sf9 cells . 
 n - ethylmaleimide- ( nem- ) modified skeletal muscle myosin was prepared as previously described   and was used to strongly adhere actin filaments to the glass surface . 
 actin filaments were isolated from chicken pectoralis ; labeled with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate ( tritc ) phalloidin overnight in buffer a ( 25  mm imidazole , ph 7.4 , 4  mm mgcl2 , 1  mm egta , 25  mm kcl , and 10  mm dtt ) prior to experiments . carboxylated qdots , emitting at 655  nm ( invitrogen - molecular probe , eugene , or ) , were attached to the myova - fl cargo - binding domain by incubating a 4  :  1 mixture of qdots to myova - fl for 15  min on ice in buffer b ( 25  mm imidazole , ph 7.4 , 4  mm mgcl2 , 1  mm egta , 25  mm kcl , 10  mm dtt , oxygen scavenger composed of 0.1  mg / ml glucose oxidase , 0.020.18  mg / ml catalase , and 3.0  mg / ml glucose ) and 0.1  mg / ml bsa . 
 streptavidin - conjugated qdots , also emitting at 655  nm ( invitrogen - molecular probe , eugene , or ) , were attached to the c - termini of the myova - hmm and myova - s1 constructs by mixing qdots and construct ( 4  :  1 ratio ) and incubating for 15 minutes on ice in buffer b plus 0.5  mg / ml bsa . 
 the mixture was further diluted to a final myova construct concentration of ~0.1  nm before imaging . 
 to attach streptavidin - conjugated qdots to actin filaments , biotinylated actin filaments were prepared by mixing 1  m actin filament , 500  nm tritc - phalloidin , and 500  nm biotin - phalloidin ( invitrogen ) in buffer a and then incubating overnight at 4c . 
 biotinylated actin filaments ( 50  nm ) were attached to the glass surface through nem - modified myosin ( see section 2.3 for details ) . after washing the flow cell with buffer 
 then 24  nm streptavidin - conjugated qdots ( emitting at 655  nm ) were introduced into the flow cell . to remove the unbound qdots , 
 the flow cell was washed by buffer a. a 20  l flow cell was constructed as described . 
 first , 20  l of nem - modified myosin   at 0.5  mg / ml in buffer c ( 25  mm imidazole , ph 7.4 , 4  mm mgcl2 , 1  mm egta , 300  mm kcl , and 10  mm dtt ) was introduced and incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature . 
 nem - modified myosin was used to fix the actin filaments to the glass surface , as it has strong binding affinity to actin . after washing the flow cell using buffer b , 20  l of 0.5  mg 
 / ml bsa in buffer b was infused and incubated for 2  min , followed by a buffer b wash . 
 tritc - phalloidin labeled actin in buffer b was then introduced into the flow - cell chamber and incubated for 2  min , followed by a buffer b wash containing a myova : qdot complex . 
 all myova constructs were strongly bound to actin in the absence of mgatp , that is , in rigor . 
 it is assumed that myova constructs bound to the top surface of the actin filaments due to the high entropy required to approach the filaments from the sides . to measure the calcium - dependent flexibility of the myova - s1 construct , 
 calcium was added to the myova - s1:qdot complex in buffer b , to a final concentration of 1  m , and then introduced into the flow cell . 
 single molecule imaging was performed at room temperature ( 23  1c ) using a nikon eclipse ti - u inverted microscope equipped with a planapo objective lens ( 100x , 1.49  n.a . ) through the objective tirf microscopy . 
 images were acquired using piper software ( piper control v2.3.14 software , stanford photonics , stanford , ca ) and a high resolution ( 95  nm per pixel ) digital camera ( standard photonics , turbo - z , stanford , ca ) . 
 qdots were excited with a 473  nm argon laser line and images obtained using a 655  20  nm emission filter ( chroma technologies , rockingham , vt ) at 8.3  ms integration time for 300 frames . following imaging of the qdots , a single image of the actin filaments in the same visual field 
 was obtained by exciting the tritc - phalloidin labeled actin with a 532  nm laser line and the emission acquired through a 605  35  nm filter ( chroma technologies , rockingham , vt ) and a 67  ms exposure time . 
 first , each series of frames was converted to double precision and summed for an effective integration time of 2.49  s , which was determined to be suitably long to sample the full extent of particle motion ( see results and discussion ; figure 3 ) . 
 summation of short exposures was chosen for this study rather than a single long exposure in order to reduce noise and confirm that the microscope stage did not drift during the experimental protocol . 
 qdots were automatically identified ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) by thresholding the summed images to binary and recording the centroids of regions which fit three different selection criteria . 
 regions were included based on size ( < 144 pixels ) and elliptical eccentricity ( < 0.86 , which is an aspect ratio of approximately 2  :  1 ) to reject regions likely representing multiple qdots in close proximity to each other . additionally , distance from edges of the image 
 qdot apparent image sizes were then measured by extracting a twelve - pixel square subwindow around each qdot ( figures 4(c ) and 4(d ) ) . 
 this window size was suitably large to fully encompass the qdot image that on average was approximately seven pixels in diameter . 
 each window was then fit , using the least squares method , by a two - dimensional gaussian function ( figure 4(e ) ) , in local coordinates x - y of the form(1)g = a12x2ex+x2/2x212y2ey+y2/2y2+b , where a is the intensity of the qdot , b is the mean intensity of the background , x and y are the x - axis and y - axis standard deviations of the gaussian function , and x and y are offsets between the center of the two - dimensional gaussian function and the center of the window . 
 an image size parameter , s , for each qdot was then defined as the average of x and y multiplied by a microscope image calibration factor ( 95  nm per pixel ) . 
 surface bound qdots ( i.e. , stationary and fixed ) were used as an internal reference and control for the tethered qdot image size parameters in the same field of view , whether they be on an actin filament or a myova construct . the reference and 
 tethered qdots were differentiated by merging images of qdots and actin filaments and manually selecting the qdots not colocalized with actin as reference qdots ( figure 4(a ) ) . 
 when two orthogonal ( i.e. , not correlated ) signals oscillating around a central point are summed , the resulting variance is the sum of the variances of the two signals . given two signals with standard deviations 1 and 2 , the sum of the two signals will thus have a deviation , 3 , given by the square root of the sum of squares:(2)3=12+22 . 
 both the reference image size parameter , sr( ) , and the tethered particle motion , t( ) ( where  may refer to images with qdots bound to actin filaments , a , or myova constructs , m ) , are defined as the deviations of normally distributed random signals , which , added together , result in an apparent image size parameter for the tethered qdot ( i.e. , st( ) ) . 
 therefore , st( ) results from letting 1 = sr( ) and 2 = t( ) in ( 2 ) . 
 this then allows the motion of the tethered particle to be determined when median values of reference ( sr( ) ) and tethered qdot ( st( ) ) image size parameters are known as in ( 3 ) . due to nonnormality of image size parameter frequency distributions ( figure 5 ) , 
 equation ( 2 ) may also be used to relate the deviations of any two points on a randomly oscillating structure that is fixed at one end to a rigid structure . 
 this is particularly useful for canceling out the compliance of the nem - modified myosin , which results in motion of the actin filaments , t(a ) . 
 the motion of a qdot tethered by a myova construct , corrected for actin filament motion , ma , may then be determined knowing the myosin tethered qdot motion , t(m ) , and the baseline actin filament motion , t(a):(4)ma=tm2ta2 . by substituting ( 3 ) into ( 4 ) , the motion of a particle tethered by a myova construct relative to actin , ma , 
 was related to the various median measured image size parameters:(5)ma = stm2srm2sta2+sra2 . for median values of st( ) and sr( ) measured for each construct , the standard error of the median ( sem ) was calculated from the standard deviation ( sd ) and sample size ( n ) assuming an approximately gaussian distribution:(6)sem=1.25sdn . 
 error propagation through ( 5 ) ( ema ) was calculated from the median image size parameters of tethered and actin - bound qdots ( st(m ) and st(a ) ) along with the sizes of their associated reference qdots ( sr(m ) and sr(a ) ) and their respective standard errors ( et(m ) , et(a ) , er(m ) , and er(a)):(7)ematastm2etm2+tasrm2erm2+tasta2eta2+tasra2era2=stm2etm2+srm2erm2sta2eta2+sra2era2stm2srm2sta2+sra2 . 
 the flexural stiffness for the various myova constructs , k , was determined by equipartition due to thermal energy , resulting in brownian motion of the tethered qdot relative to the actin filament , ma , where kb is boltzmann 's constant and t is temperature in degrees kelvin:(8)k = kbtma2 . 
 the persistence length of the tether , lp , is defined as ei / kbt , where ei is the flexural rigidity of a prismatic rod . 
 assuming that the tether acts as a cantilevered beam , with load imparted primarily through the qdot at the end , the effective spring constant , k , can be related to flexural rigidity by k = 3ei / l . combining these two expressions and substituting into ( 8) allow lp to be calculated directly from the motion of the tethered qdot relative to actin ( ma ) and the length of the molecule , l ( see figure 2):(9)lp = l33ma2 . 
 in addition to being used to measure the flexural stiffness of myova constructs , the effective motions of the distal rod domain were isolated by using the procedure above with the motion of qdots bound to myova - hmm constructs rather than actin filaments as the baseline of comparison for myova - fl . 
 the validity of the tethered particle motion approach was confirmed by defining the relationship between myosin tethered qdot motion relative to the actin filament ( ma ) ( see ( 5 ) ) and the assumed tether length , l , for the various myova constructs , which was estimated to span from the actin filament surface to the center of the attached 20  nm qdot , with the length of the myova construct based on its structure   ( see figure 2 ) . to test the significance or the trend in ma with l 
 , a linear regression was performed using prism 6 ( graphpad inc . ) . in general 
 , ma was expected to increase with increasing l , which in fact was the case ( see figure 6 ) . 
 a pilot study showed no significant effect of up to 100  nm of displacement out of the focal plane on qdot image size parameters ( see figure s1 in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/465693 ) , confirming that the trend in increasing ma with l was , in fact , the result of tether compliance and not focal separation   between tethered and reference qdots . 
 to estimate the flexural stiffness of myova - fl and its subdomains , we utilized long exposure time tpm imaging of qdots attached to various myova constructs that served as flexible tethers ( figure 2 ) . 
 the long exposure times were necessary since the brownian excursion time for a qdot tethered to a myova construct should have been on the order of microseconds . based on our experience , imaging qdots with acceptable signal  : 
 thus , accurately assigning the tethered qdot 's location at a single point in time was effectively impossible . 
 however , at the other extreme , millisecond exposures do not fully sample the qdot 's excursion overall times . 
 therefore , to accurately estimate myova 's flexural stiffness , the full range of tethered qdot motion is needed ; otherwise the ambiguity in tracking the qdot 's position results in a significant underestimate of motion . 
 imaging for relatively long exposure times ( 100  ms ) by summing sequentially acquired images ( see section 2 ) ( figure 3 ) circumvents this issue by sampling the full distribution of particle locations and becomes insensitive to exact exposure times . 
 a further advantage of tpm is the ability to efficiently estimate the flexural stiffness of a large number of myova constructs simultaneously within each visual field . 
 we measured image size parameters for qdots bound to actin and tethered by various myova constructs . before relating these parameters to estimates of tether motion and thus flexural stiffness 
 , it was important to control for the effective motion ( i.e. , noise ) in the imaging system , the mode of qdot attachment , and the actin filament movement to which the various myova constructs were bound ( figure 2 ) . to control for the imaging system noise 
 , image size parameters were obtained for qdots bound to the microscope slide and the nem - modified myosin layer under identical imaging conditions ( figure 2 ) . 
 these image size parameters were no different ( 185.8  2.8  nm and 184.3  2.3  nm mean  sem , resp . ) , indicating that image size parameters for qdots in the visual field that were not bound to actin and are suitable for use as stationary , surface - bound qdot references , sr . 
 however , qdots bound directly to actin filaments showed 17  nm of motion , t(a ) , relative to reference qdots , r(a ) ( table 1 ) . this amount of motion indicates substantial compliance in the nem - modified myosin attachment to the actin filaments , requiring the use of actin - bound qdots and their motion as a corrective baseline for myova stiffness estimates ( table 1 ) . 
 using a range of different length myova constructs ( figure 2 ) , we observed a proportional increase in tethered qdot motion relative to actin , ma , with increasing tether length , that is , the length of the myova construct , l ( table 1 ; figure 6 ) . 
 the linear regression of ma with respect to l was statistically significant ( slope = 0.341 , p < 0.01 ) , with all points falling between the theoretical bounds of 1 ( which assumes a tether with zero stiffness ) and 0 ( perfectly rigid tether ) . 
 in addition , to the flexural stiffness of the various myova constructs , we could estimate the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains , that is , the lever arms , lever arm / coiled - coil junction , and distal rod ( table 1 , figure 7 ) as presented below . 
 myova 's lever arms and their elasticity   are critical to the motor 's processive movement . 
 differential strain in the motor 's lever arms while undergoing processive movement is apparent in electron   and atomic force   microscopic images in which bending of the leading head 's lever arm is observed as it attempts its power stroke against the resistive load of the strongly bound trailing head . with the kinetics of the chemomechanical cycle of the individual heads being load - dependent , 
 the difference in strain experienced by the leading and trailing heads is believed to underlie the gating mechanism that assures forward displacement of the motor along actin [ 21 , 36 ] . 
 therefore , the lever arm flexural stiffness may be tuned via calcium signaling to effectively allow or inhibit this necessary intramolecular communication between heads . using tpm , 
 the motion of qdots attached to the c - termini of single - headed myova - s1 constructs relative to actin - bound baseline qdots was used to estimate the lever arm stiffness ( see ( 5 ) ) . 
 based on electron microscopic images , the position of a strongly bound myova head domain appears fixed on the actin filament relative to the observed swinging motion of the lever arm during the power stroke . 
 therefore , we assumed that the tethered qdot motion predominantly reflects the 0.0346  pn / nm flexural stiffness of the lever arm ( figure 7 ; table 1 ) with a corresponding persistence length of 242  nm . a significantly higher stiffness value of 0.21  pn / nm for the myova - s1 was estimated using oscillatory length perturbations in the laser trap assay . 
 however , this approach most likely imposed a combination of bending and axial tension , which would be expected to lead to higher stiffness values . 
 the tpm method more closely approximates pure bending , so that the tpm estimate for persistence length agrees with our previous estimate of 310  nm , based on myova - s1 step size measurements in a laser trap assay . in these earlier studies , 
 the motor itself imposed an internal bending strain on the lever arm due to the power stroke working against the stiffness of the laser trap and thus would have been dominated by bending rather than tensile forces . following the addition of calcium , the average motion of qdots tethered to the myova - s1 c - terminus increased by 10% , indicating a 40% reduction in lever arm flexural stiffness ( figure 7 ; table 1 ) . a substantial decrease in stiffness 
 is expected , given that the addition of calcium can disassociate as many as three calmodulins from each lever arm , exposing the underlying alpha - helix , which by itself is assumed to be unstable [ 12 , 13 , 37 ] . 
 it is important to note that although calmodulins could dissociate from the lever arm in the absence of calcium without excess calmodulin in the assay buffer , as in our experimental conditions , we do not believe this was the case . 
 it has been shown that myova - hmm processivity , as defined by the motor 's run length , is a sensitive measure of interhead communication that relies on rigid lever arms [ 12 , 37 ] . 
 thus , the addition of calcium leads to an abrupt decline in processivity as calmodulins dissociate and the lever arms become compliant [ 12 , 37 ] . however , in control experiments ( figure s4 in supplemental materials ) , run lengths for myova - hmm with and without excess calmodulin in the assay buffer were unchanged , confirming that the lever arms ' calmodulin occupancy under our zero calcium conditions was fully intact . 
 interestingly , in addition to an increase in the average tethered qdot motion with calcium , there was a large increase in the variance of the qdot motion , with the sem increasing from 3  nm to 21  nm ( figure 6 ) . 
 the number of calmodulins dissociated from each individual lever arm is variable , with an average of 2.2 per lever [ 13 , 37 ] , which may account for the broad distribution of observed tethered qdot motions for the myova - s1 construct in the presence of calcium ( figure 6 ; table 1 ) . 
 the observed decrease in lever arm flexural stiffness is likely large enough to negatively impact the interhead communication and gating   necessary for force production and processivity . 
 the myova rod domain lies between the lever arms and the globular tail domain ( figure 7 ) . 
 this rod is predominantly -helical coiled - coil and contains two pest sites , with the -helical coiled - coil in the proximal rod prior to the first pest site necessary for myova dimerization   ( figure 7 ) . to estimate the flexural stiffness of the distal rod domain , we compared the tethered qdot motion of the myova - fl construct to that of the myova - hmm construct , which was truncated just before the first pest site ( figures 2 and 7 ) . 
 our measurements suggest that the distal rod segment , itself , has a flexural stiffness of 0.0326  pn / nm . unlike the lever arm , however , it is difficult to apply ( 9 ) and calculate a persistence length for the rod segment , as the exact length and structure of the distal rod are unknown , with estimates of the distal rod ranging up to 38  nm not including the 7  nm globular tail domain [ 4 , 27 ] . 
 the observed increase in tethered particle excursion requires the distal rod to have some effective length , though the measured stiffness requires a structure composed of either a long ( ~35  nm ) segment of coiled - coil ( lp = 100  nm ) or a series of coiled - coil segments interspersed with highly compliant disordered segments . 
 both the regulatory interaction between the globular tail and motor domains [ 27 , 40 , 41 ] and the variation in apparent rod lengths in electron micrographs strongly suggest the latter . 
 interestingly , the flexural stiffness for the myova - hmm and myova - fl constructs is an order of magnitude lower than both the distal coiled - coil rod domain and lever arms ( table 1 , figure 7 ) . with the tpm measurements for both of the myova - hmm and myova - fl constructs obtained in rigor 
 , we assume that for either construct both heads are strongly bound to the actin filament . 
 the two - headed bound state with the two lever arms in a triangular arrangement   should give a combined stiffness for the two levers , which is greater than a single lever arm and greater than the flexural stiffness of the rod . 
 thus , the extremely low myova - hmm and myova - fl flexural stiffness require that the lever arm / rod junction must be highly compliant . 
 this compliance must contribute to the free diffusive search of the unbound leading head [ 18 , 19 ] , allowing myova to maneuver through actin - actin intersections   and to switch tracks on actin bundles . 
 we have developed a unique system , utilizing long exposure tpm , to measure the flexural stiffness of single molecules with lengths less than 100  nm . 
 the estimates of flexural stiffness for various myova constructs and subdomains by tpm offer direct insight into the structural components of the myova motor that are critical to its functional capacities . 
 specifically , the lever arms must be rigid enough to allow intramolecular strains to be communicated between heads for proper gating and control of the motor 's processivity . 
 the compliance of the lever arm / rod junction must have sufficient flexibility to allow myova to avoid intracellular obstacles and deliver cargo efficiently to its destination in vivo through the dense actin meshwork . 
 in addition , the potential for alterations in the lever arm stiffness with changes in intracellular calcium may provide a measure of tunability in regulating cargo transport and delivery linked to changes in the cell 's ionic environment .","myosin va ( myova ) is a processive molecular motor involved in intracellular cargo transport on the actin cytoskeleton . 
 the motor 's processivity and ability to navigate actin intersections are believed to be governed by the stiffness of various parts of the motor 's structure . 
 specifically , changes in calcium may regulate motor processivity by altering the motor 's lever arm stiffness and thus its interhead communication . in order to measure the flexural stiffness of myova subdomains , 
 we use tethered particle microscopy , which relates the brownian motion of fluorescent quantum dots , which are attached to various single- and double - headed myova constructs bound to actin in rigor , to the motor 's flexural stiffness . based on these measurements , the myova lever arm and coiled - coil rod domain 
 have comparable flexural stiffness ( 0.034  pn / nm ) . 
 upon addition of calcium , the lever arm stiffness is reduced 40% as a result of calmodulins potentially dissociating from the lever arm . 
 in addition , the flexural stiffness of the full - length myova construct is an order of magnitude less stiff than both a single lever arm and the coiled - coil rod .

 when breathing begins through the nose , the air is prepared in order to reach the lungs with the ideal conditions , that is , warmed , moistened , and filtered , thus activating immunological processes such as mucociliary transport and microbicidal activity that protect the lower airway . 
 when breathing begins through the mouth , despite air warming and moistening , no filtering or immunological activity occurs1 . 
 when mouth breathing occurs in childhood , a period during which intense facial muscular and skeletal growth occurs , it promotes a pathological adaptation of the structures of the stomatognathic system , to the detriment of the usually harmonious morphological and functional growth of these structures2 . 
 the main causes of mouth breathing in childhood are the hypertrophy of the pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil , nasal mucosa and turbinate edema , nasal septal deviation , extended suction habits , and others3 . 
 morphological adaptations in mouth - breathing children occur with the aim of facilitating the necessary arrival of the air to the alveoli . 
 thus , it is possible to observe maxillary hypoplasia and posterior mandibular demotion / rotation , which lead to dental occlusion alterations , higher mandibular inclination , and a vertical facial growth pattern , with alterations in normal facial proportions and hard palate elevation , head anteriorization , and muscular deharmonization , occurring mainly in the nasofacial region . 
 these adaptations generate functional changes in the stomatognathic system , which are observed through alterations in speech , chewing , and deglutition4

 the complexity of the consequences of mouth breathing that are associated with various etiologies justifies the participation of several professionals , including otorhinolaryngologists , odontologists , phonoaudiologists , physiotherapists , pediatricians , among others , along the different phases of the care of mouth - breathers , including the diagnosis , treatment , rehabilitation , and the prevention of mouth breathing in childhood . 
 multidisciplinary staff integration is essential , as it is desirable to use a uniform categorization of mouth breathers , consisting of the same terminology and the same complementary exams . 
 accurate diagnosis of the cause of mouth breathing is essential to the effectiveness of treatment . in phonoaudiology , the type of care that is used for mouth - breathing patients is typically determined by the etiology of the altered respiratory mode . 
 therefore , the accurate use of the available diagnostic options contributes to early diagnosis , and will aid in the establishment of a multidisciplinary therapeutics that are more appropriate to each case and minimize relapse during mouth breathing rehabilitation7

 most causes of mouth breathing are diagnosed through a disarmed otorhinolaryngologic exam , except for the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , which demands that complementary exams be used3 . in the diagnosis of pharyngeal hyperplasia , 
 nasopharyngoscopy is a procedure that is used to visualize the pharyngeal tonsil and its relation to other nasopharyngeal structures , and is considered by many authors as the most reliable exam in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal obstruction9

 cephalometry is an exam that is similar to cavum radiography ; however , it is carried out through the use of a cephalostat , which enables the most appropriate patient positioning , and provides data related to craniofacial growth and the myofunctional status of these structures14 . since it is a noninvasive exam 
 , it is more comfortable for the patient , and is often more accepted by children . 
 moreover , is associated with a lower cost and greater availability relative to nasopharyngoscopy . with the aim of contributing to the accurate diagnosis of mouth breathing , 
 this study was carried out with the purpose of verifying the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry in the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils . 
 the preset study was approved by the research ethics committee of the institution of origin under the protocol number 220.0.243.000 - 8 . 
 the children agreed to take part in the study and the informed consent forms were signed by their representatives . the study sample consisted of children from 3 public schools who were evaluated from september 2008 through december 2009 . 
 the inclusion criteria were included complaints related to mouth breathing , such as night drooling , snoring , and restless sleep ; the group age ranged from 7.0 to 11.11 years . 
 children that presented evident neurological disorders , craniofacial malformation , syndromes , or history of pharyngeal surgery were excluded from the study . 
 after employing the inclusion and exclusion criteria , 55 children , including 25 males and 30 females , with an average age 9.8 years were selected . 
 these children underwent otorhinolaryngologic assessment , as well as nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry to check for the presence or absence of nasopharyngeal obstruction . 
 any other causes of obstruction of the upper airway , such as nasal septal deviation , primary hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates , polyps , and malformations were not diagnosed in the study sample . for the patients with bacterial rhinosinusitis and/or symptomatic allergic rhinitis , 
 appropriate treatments were prescribed and subsequent revaluation was carried out during a period ranging from 30 to 60 days . after this period was completed , the nasopharyn - goscopy and cephalometry exams were performed . 
 otorhinolaryngologic evaluation was carried out in the presence of and with the help of the parents or sponsors . 
 after a general and specific otorhinolaryngologic anamnesis was conducted , giving emphasis to the aspects related to mouth / nasal breathing , a physical exam consisting of otoscopy , anterior rhinoscopy , cervical palpation , and nasoscopy was carried out . 
 this evaluation allowed for the determination of whether the patient had either an oral or mouth - breathing mode . immediately after the completion of the anamnesis and the otorhinolaryngologic clinical exam , 
 nasopharyngoscopy was carried out , always by the same assessor and in the same environment , employing topical anesthesia ( lidocaine 5% ) and a nasal vasoconstrictor ( oxymetazoline 0.05% ) , with a flexible nasofibroscope ( 3.2 mm mashida brand , microcamera asap ) , and recorded on dvd . through this exam , 
 apart from studying the size and the relation of the pharyngeal tonsil to the nasopharynx , the nasal septum positioning , turbinate size , upper pole of the palatine tonsils , presence of secretions , and other kinds of lesions in the nasal cavity and hypopharynx were assessed . 
 when using nasopharyngoscopy to determine the level of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , we used a graded scale in which the relation of the pharyngeal tonsils to the other structures that are present in the nasopharynx was assessed15 , as follows : grade 1tonsil without contact with the nasopharyngeal structures ( figure 1 ) ; grade 2tonsil in contact with the torus tubarius ( figure 2 ) ; grade 3tonsil in contact with the torus tubarius and vomer ( figure 3 ) ; grade 4tonsil in contact with the torus tubarius , vomer , and the soft palate at rest ( figure 4 ) . 
 grade 1 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils by nasofibropharyngoscopy and cephalometry ( cephalometric analysis ) . 
 grade 2 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils by nasofibropharyngoscopy and cephalometry ( cephalometric analysis ) . 
 grade 3 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils by nasofibropharyngoscopy and cephalometry ( cephalometric analysis ) . 
 grade 4 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils by nasofibropharyngoscopy and cephalometry ( cephalometric analysis ) subsequently , children were referred to the odontological radiology service center to undergo a cephalometric assessment , through which it was possible to obtain a left profile cranium teleradiograph by using the cephalostat for positioning the patient at a distance of 1.5 meters . for the standard lateral radiography assessment , 
 computerized cephalometric tracing was performed with cef x software ( a computerized cephalometry system version 2.4.0.0 from cdt software for informatics consulting , development , and training ) . 
 the exam was carried out with the same equipment in each patient , and was analyzed by the same professional expert in odontological radiology . when using cephalometric analysis , in order to determine the level of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , we used a graded scale in which the airway between the palate pharynx border and the point that was most proximal to the pharynx was measured in millimeters16 , as follows : grade 1nasopharyngeal space larger than 6  mm ( figure 1 ) ; grade 2nasopharyngeal space between 4.1 and 6  mm ( figure 2 ) ; grade 3nasopharyngeal space between 2.1 and 4  mm ( figure 3 ) ; grade 4nasopharyngeal space between 0 and 2  mm ( figure 4 ) . in order to verify the correlation between the nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry examinations , 
 the test results in a correlation coefficient ranging from -1 to + 1 , with zero indicating that there is no correlation , -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation , and + 1 denoting a perfect positive correlation ; the closer to 1 or + 1 , the greater the correlation between the variables that are being tested . the possible results for a positive correlation are17 : 0 when there is no correlation ; between 0 and 0.3 - poor correlation ; between 0.3 and 0.6 - regular correlation ; between 0.6 and 0.9 - a very strong correlation ; equal to 1a perfect correlation between the data . 
 for calculating the sensitivity , specificity , the positive predictive value , and the negative predictive value of radiologic exams , nasopharyngoscopy was considered to be the reference exam ( the gold standard ) . 
 it was also necessary to establish limit values in order to determine whether the exams that were studied were either positive or negative . 
 therefore , the grade 1 and 2 nasopharyngoscopic and cephalometric exams were considered to be negative , and the grade 3 and 4 exams were considered to be positive . 
 table 1 shows the results of the correlation analysis between the nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry examinations in diagnosing the grade of hyperplasia in the pharyngeal tonsils . 
 n  =  number of children ; p  =  significance level at 5% ; r  =  spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . from the analysis of the results presented in table 1 , it was possible to verify that the spearman 's rank correlation coefficient , rho ( r ) , was equal to 0.52 . 
 this result indicates a significant regular and positive association between the nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry assessments ( p  =  0.000 ) at a significance level of 5% . 
 table 2 describes the nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry distribution results that were used for assessing the diagnostic tests . in table 2 , using nasopharyngoscopy as the gold standard for the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , it was possible to verify that the sensitivity of cephalometry ( determined by the proportion between the number of correct positive radiographic cephalometry diagnoses and the total number of positive cases ) was 35% . 
 the negative predictive value of cephalometry ( determined by the proportion between the number of correct negative diagnoses and the total number of negative cases ) was 97% . 
 the positive predictive value of the cephalometric exam ( determined by the ratio of the number of correct positive cephalometric diagnoses and the total number of positive cephalometric diagnoses ) was found to be 87% . 
 the negative predictive value ( determined by the ratio of the number of correct negative cephalometric diagnoses and the total number of negative cephalometric diagnoses ) was 72% . 
 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils is one of the main causes of upper airway obstruction . for this reason , 
 studies have been carried out with the objective of assessing the reliability of the available diagnostic procedures that are used for the detection of nasopharyngeal obstruction resulting from the increased size of the pharyngeal tonsils . 
 the most commonly used exams are cavum radiographs , flexible and rigid nasopharyngoscopy , and cephalometry11 
 13 
 18 . 
 reports in the literature indicate that there is concern regarding the best method for diagnosing and treating children in which hyperplasia of pharyngeal tonsils is suspected , which a frequently occurring situation in the otorhinolaryngological practice13 
 19 . 
 therefore , this study aimed to establish a correlation between the nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry examinations in the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , while highlighting their main contributions . 
 the findings of this study demonstrated that it was possible to verify a regular and positive correlation , r  =  0.52 ; however , a perfect correlation between the exams was not found . 
 the results revealed that most of the children showed grade 2 and 3 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , followed by grade 1 in the nasopharyngoscopic exam , and most of the children showed grade 1 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , followed by grade 2 in the cephalometric assessment ( table 1 ) . after analyzing these results , it was possible to infer that cephalometry , as compared to nasopharyngoscopy , presented a tendency to underestimate the pharyngeal tonsil size in the nasopharynx . 
 the sensitivity of cephalometric exam , which indicates the probability of a positive result when the patient presents with the condition in question , was 35% . the negative predictive value , which expresses the probability that the individual does not present with the condition in question when the exam result is negative , was 72% . 
 these results suggested that a negative cephalometric exam might not provide a proper assessment of the nasopharynx when compared to the nasopharyngoscopic exam . 
 similar results were obtained when cavum radiography and flexible nasopharyngoscopy for the assessment of the grade of nasopharyngeal obstruction were compared in other similar study13 . 
 the authors concluded that children with classical symptoms of respiratory obstruction , in the absence of hypertrophy of the pharyngeal tonsils by a radiological exam , should undergo flexible nasopharyngoscopy in order to achieve a more accurate diagnosis . 
 several published studies consider nasopharyngoscopy to be the gold standard exam for assessing the nasopharynx12 
 13 
 20 
 21 
 22 . 
 this is justified , among other reasons , by the dynamic and tridimensional nasopharyngeal view provided by this assessment , which makes it possible to analyze not only the pharyngeal tonsil size , but also its relation with other structures in the region . 
 this may explain the reason why , in the comparison between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry , the latter tended to underestimate the size and position of the pharyngeal tonsils in relation to the nasopharynx . 
 frequently in clinical practice , it is possible to verify that patients with mouth breathing symptoms who show normal or next to normal pharyngeal tonsil size with radiological exams , may present hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils and other alterations , such as hypertrophy of the lower turbinate and posterior nasal septal deviation , when assessed by nasopharyngoscopy . 
 this statement is reinforced by another study11 in which 45 children between 4 and 12 years of age were assessed with nasopharyngoscopy ; all of them presented chronic nasal obstruction due to hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , and cavum radiography revealed no alterations . 
 the results demonstrated that 27% ( 17 cases ) of the pharyngeal tonsils were estimated to be large , 42% ( 24 cases ) of the pharyngeal tonsils were of moderate size , and 31% ( 19 cases ) of the pharyngeal tonsils were small . 
 furthermore , the exams detected 8 cases of hypertrophy of the lower turbinate ( 13.3% ) and 4 cases of posterior nasal septal deviation ( 6.6% ) . 
 these findings reinforced the importance of the indication of nasopharyngoscopy for children with nasal obstruction and normal radiological exams , as this exam allows direct , tridimensional , and dynamic assessment of the cavum area . 
 on the other hand , another study23 that verified the efficacy of lateral cephalometric radiography in the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils compared with nasal endoscopy , differs from the results of the present study , as the authors substantiated that lateral cephalometric radiography proved to be an effective exam because of its sensitivity , specificity , and high positive and negative predictive values for diagnosis . 
 they concluded that in spite of the superiority of nasopharyngoscopy in assessing the nasopharynx , a cephalometric exam that was negative for hypertrophy of the pharyngeal tonsils would be sufficient to exclude this pathology . 
 based on information that was derived from 3 units that comprise the sus ( sistema nico de sade ) , another study reported that mouth breathing is the most frequently cited complaint and that cavum radiography was the most commonly requested exam by otorhinolaryngologists19 . from the results of the present study , it can be inferred that if only the radiographic exam is used for the detection of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils , a proper mouth - breather diagnosis and treatment might be compromised , as in some cases the grade of pharyngeal tonsil obstruction was underestimated relative to the nasopharyngoscopic exam . 
 when not treated in childhood , mouth breathing causes many alterations , including craniofacial , dental , and phonoarticulatory changes , as well as alterations in body posture , oral functions , sleep , nutrition , behavior , and others24 . 
 all of these alterations that are presented by mouth breathers require multidisciplinary intervention , including physicians , phonoaudiologists , odontologists , physiotherapists , among others1 . 
 although cephalometry was only regularly correlated with nasopharyngoscopy in diagnosing mouth breathing , that exam was able to complement the endoscopic exam , thus providing information regarding facial growth that could be documented and monitored . 
 this information will be useful for other professionals involved in the care of mouth - breathing patients . 
 cephalometry provides early identification of many alterations that are present in mouth - breathing patients and provides the otorhinolaryngologist with information about the nasopharynx , informs the phonoaudiologist about morphological alterations of the stomatognathic system , and informs the odontologists about facial growth and dental occlusion3 
 14 
 23 . 
 therefore , cephalometry is useful not only for the initial diagnosis , but also in cost reduction and promoting collaboration between the multidisciplinary staff members that are involved in the care of mouth - breathing patients . a research study comparing cavum radiography with cephalometry found that in the first exam 61% of the patients were incorrectly positioned25 . 
 importantly , the cephalostat is used in cephalometry to control the positioning of the patient , which explains the superiority of this exam compared to cavum radiography . 
 although nasopharyngoscopy is the gold standard exam for nasopharyngeal assessments , cephalometry is a complementary exam that provides information about craniofacial growth , thus making it possible to document and monitor the complex morphofunctional modifications related to mouth breathing . in this study , 
 cephalometry showed a tendency to underestimate the size of pharyngeal tonsil compared with nasopharyngoscopy ; therefore , we suggest that patients presenting with mouth - breathing symptoms and normal radiography be referred for a complementary assessment with nasopharyngoscopy , which is associated with greater diagnostic accuracy due to its tridimensional and dynamic nature . 
 nasopharyngeal assessment of children can be performed with nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry , as these exams are associated with a regular and positive correlation . 
 however , we found that cephalometry tends to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsil compared with nasopharyngoscopy . 
 therefore , nasopharyngoscopy is suggested when the cephalometry results for nasopharyngeal obstruction are negative in patients with mouth - breathing symptoms .","summary 
 introduction :  hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsil is one of the main causes of mouth breathing , and accurate diagnosis of this alteration is important for proper therapeutic planning . 
 therefore , studies have been conducted in order to provide information regarding the procedures that can be used for the diagnosis of pharyngeal obstruction . 
 objective :  to verify the correlation between nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometric examinations in the diagnosis of pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia .

 fifty - five children took part in this study , 30 girls and 25 boys , aged between 7 and 11 years . 
 the children underwent nasofibropharyngoscopic and cephalometric evaluation to determine the grade of nasopharyngeal obstruction . 
 the spearman 's rank correlation coefficient at the 5% significance level was used to verify the correlation between these exams . 
 results :  in the nasopharyngoscopy evaluation , most children showed grade 2 and 3 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsil , which was followed by grade 1 . in the cephalometry assessment , most children showed grade 1 hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsil , which was followed by grade 2 . a statistically significant regular positive correlation was observed between the exams . 
 conclusion :  it was concluded that the evaluation of the pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia could be carried out by fiber optic nasopharyngoscopy and cephalometry , as these examinations were regularly correlated . 
 however , it was found that cephalometry tended to underestimate the size of the pharyngeal tonsil relative to nasopharyngoscopy .",pubmed
"the incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse ( ibtr ) in patients previously treated for breast carcinoma through breast - conserving surgery , systemic adjuvant therapy and radiation therapy , is estimated to be less than 6% . however , as each case has different clinical relevance ( evolution , prognosis and therapeutic management ) , it is necessary to distinguish in these patients between a true local recurrence ( tr ) of a previous tumor , and the appearance of a new primary tumor ( npt ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . to do this 
 , we must study the location of the new tumor ( distance from the previous tumor ) , staging ( by imaging and biopsy ) and determine their histological subtype ( through immunohistochemical studies , and the determination of her-2 and hormone receptor expression ) . 
 a 35-year - old premenopausal woman with no relevant medical history of interest , except for a family history of a maternal cousin with breast cancer at 28 years , was referred to the oncologic gynecology department by the palpation of a 1-cm nodule in the right axilla . 
 fine needle aspiration cytology was performed , with the pathological result of suspicion of malignancy . in february 2004 
 the pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma ( idc ) of the right breast of 0.8 cm in size , with no metastasis detected in 20 lymph nodes removed ( pt1 pn0 m0 ) . 
 immunohistochemical study of the tumor cells showed positive staining for both estrogen receptors ( er ) and progesterone receptors ( pr ) in 50 and 15% , respectively , and showed negative membrane staining of her-2 marker . 
 fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) analysis found no her-2 amplification in the primary tumor . 
 the computer tomography performed after surgical intervention revealed no other organs compromised or distant metastatic extension . 
 preoperative serum levels of the marker ca 15 - 3 were normal . with this diagnosis , the patient was referred to our medical oncology department where she received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of adriamycin 60 mg / m and cyclophosphamide 600 mg / m every 3 weeks . 
 then , adjuvant radiotherapy ( 50 gy ) was performed on right - breast residual tissue , followed by adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen 20 mg daily during the following 4 years . 
 meanwhile , the patient continued routine follow - up visits in our department . in january 2008 ( 
 4 years after surgery ) , the patient noticed the presence of periareolar thickening in the right breast with redness and heat . in the physical examination 
 a mammography showed the presence of breast architectural distortion with high suspicion of malignancy ( birads-4 ) . 
 the result of the biopsy of the lesion confirmed the presence of an idc consistent with the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer ( pt4 nx m0 ) in the same breast where the previous tumor was treated . 
 immunohistochemical study of biopsy sample showed negative staining for both er and pr , and showed positive membrane staining of her-2 marker . 
 then , the patient received treatment with a weekly schedule of paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m ) plus carboplatin ( auc = 2 ) 3 weeks on and 1 week off , in combination with weekly trastuzumab ( initially 4 mg / kg followed by 2 mg / kg every week ) . 
 she received a total of 11 cycles of chemotherapy schedule and 15 cycles of trastuzumab . during that time period , 
 , there was a progressive decrease of inflammatory signs , with disappearance of the redness and heat from the affected area . 
 after surgery , the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 8 cycles of weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg / m ) in combination with weekly trastuzumab ( 2 mg / kg ) , followed by trastuzumab monotherapy ( 6 mg / kg every 3 weeks ) up to 1 year of treatment . 
 later , the patient underwent breast reconstruction surgery , and currently , after 4 years and 8 months of follow - up after the last surgery , the patient remains in complete clinical remission , developing her life normally . 
 however , given the age of the patient at the time of first diagnosis and due to the presence of a second primary tumor in the same breast , a genetic study was performed with negative results for currently known breast cancer - associated genetic mutations . 
 breast cancer is a major public health problem for women throughout the world , and idc is the most frequent form of invasive breast cancer . 
 it accounts for 7080% of all cases of invasive carcinomas , and , in global , is the histologic type of breast cancer with the worst prognosis of all [ 6 , 7 ] . 
 its treatment is based on a multidisciplinary approach consisting in primary tumor surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy , and hormone therapy if indicated . currently , the treatment of choice for idc is a combination therapy based on neoadjuvant chemotherapy , targeted therapy , surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy , hormone therapy and radiation therapy . 
 numerous randomized prospective studies have shown that breast - conserving treatment in idc is as effective as mastectomy in terms of overall survival , disease - free survival and long - term disease - free survival [ 8 , 9 ] . 
 inflammatory breast carcinoma is a rare and very aggressive form of locally advanced breast carcinomas . 
 it represents 0.55% of primary invasive breast tumors , being more common in caucasian women under 60 years . in these cases , it is important to make a differential diagnosis with locally advanced 
 noninflammatory breast carcinomas that subsequently evolve with inflammation , as well as other non - neoplastic diseases ( mastitis and breast abscess ) , by using biopsies and imaging tests to confirm the differential clinical diagnosis . 
 after breast - conserving treatment , ibtr may represent two distinct types of lesion that it is important to define , a tr or an npt . 
 tr and npt have different natural histories , prognosis , and in turn different implications for therapeutic management [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . in a retrospective study , designed by bouchardy et al . 
 , about second primary contralateral breast cancer , it is concluded that women with er - positive first tumors have a decreased risk of second breast cancer occurrence ( standardized incidence ratio ( sir ) : 0.67 ; 95% confidence interval ( ci ) , 0.480.90 ) , whereas patients with er - negative primary tumors have an increased risk limited to er - negative second tumors ( sir : 7.94 ; 95% ci , 3.8114.60 ) . 
 patients with positive family history had a tenfold higher risk of er - negative second tumor which increased to nearly 50-fold when the first tumor was er negative . 
 so the risk of second er - negative breast cancer is really very high after a first er - negative tumor , particularly in women with strong family history . 
 certain studies provide additional evidence on differences between er - positive and er - negative breast cancer , not only in presentation , prognosis , and treatment , but also in etiology and natural history . 
 overall , the risk of developing a second breast cancer among women diagnosed with a first breast cancer of any er status was similar to the risk of developing a first breast cancer in the general population . 
 but it is important to analyze the first breast cancer by means of immunohistochemical markers , because risk of a second tumor depends on er status , period of diagnosis , and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer ; and consequently , surveillance and prevention of second cancer occurrence should consider these risk factors . the risk of a second breast cancer is the same whether the patient had previously underwent a mastectomy or bct . and 
 with bct , the risk for developing a second primary breast cancer in the preserved breast is similar to the contralateral one . unlike disease recurrence 
 , second primary breast cancer often occurs after the first 36 months , with an average range from 34 to 60 months , requiring a long - term follow - up . 
 secondary malignancies of the breast are rare with a reported frequency of 0.4 to 2.16% . according to the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project ( nsabp ) , there is a 14.3% cumulative incidence of ibtr over 20 years since primary operation . 
 ibtr can be defined as the re - emergence of tumor in the previously treated breast . 
 ibtr rate is under 1% per year , but it is about 5 to 10% at 5 years and 10 to 15% at 10 years . when evaluating ibtr , it is important to consider whether it is a tr or an npt . on the one hand , 
 tr are cases consistent with the regrowth of malignant cells not removed by surgery or not killed by radiotherapy , as veronesi et al .   defined them . on the other hand , 
 npts are de novo cases of malignancies arising from mammary epithelial cells of the residual breast tissue [ 4 , 8 ] . 
 the complex behavior of ibtr may be related to the fact that the ibtr patient population is composed by these two different entities . 
 each ibtr can be classified as either tr or as npt based on the following criteria : according to pathologic features , npt is designated when it is a distinct histology type ( e.g. from an infiltrating ductal carcinoma to an infiltrating lobular , tubular , or medullar carcinoma ) , or when it has a change from a more invasive to a less invasive carcinoma . 
 by contrast , a change in histology from ductal carcinoma in situ to an infiltrating ductal carcinoma is considered as tr because it is consistent with the natural progression of the disease . depending on whether the relapse occurs at or near the original site of the primary tumor . 
 a tumor is classified as npt if it changes from an aneuploid primary to a diploid relapse ; otherwise , it would be considered as a probable progression representing the natural history . 
 the best way to differentiate npt and tr would be genetic sequencing ( to establish true clonality ) . 
 recently , some molecular techniques such as dna finger printing , loss of heterozygosity pattern or allelic imbalances profile have been used to distinguish npt from tr , but the classification criteria are not standardized yet . 
 patients with npt were significantly younger at initial diagnosis than those who experienced tr . however , there are no age differences at relapse . 
 the rate of np in the ipsilateral breast does not differ significantly from the rate of primary contralateral tumors . 
 currently , salvage mastectomy is the standard treatment for all types of ibtr , which provides locoregional control in 90% of patients . 
 this recommendation is based on an elevated risk of further in - breast relapse with conservative surgeries . 
 but , there is no conclusive evidence of its superiority compared to conservative surgery , the number of repeat lumpectomies is small and the follow - up is not long enough to draw definitive conclusions . 
 further studies are needed to determine the indications . after the surgical management of ibtr , the optimal systemic therapy is also unknown . 
 tr has a poor prognosis in terms of survival rates and development of other metastases , and may benefit from more aggressive adjuvant treatment , with additional radiotherapy , hormone therapy and chemotherapy . 
 by contrast , patients with npt generally have a favorable prognosis , and therapeutic decisions concerning systemic therapy should be similar to those in patients with de novo breast carcinoma , according to the equivalent stage . however , because of the higher risk of developing contralateral breast carcinoma ( genetic predisposition ) there is a need for better chemoprevention strategies . 
 two trials have shown that patients with npt benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen , if indicated , because it reduces contralateral and ipsilateral disease recurrence with minimal side effects . 
 due to declining mortality rates that are , in part , attributable to the use of screening mammography and effective adjuvant therapy , more women are surviving their breast cancer . 
 the care of breast cancer survivors is an important issue that requires an understanding of relapse patterns , establishing appropriate follow - up visits and screening tests . 
 nowadays , there exists a good follow - up among cancer survivors , with higher screening rates .

 we report the case of a 35-year - old woman who developed a breast invasive ductal carcinoma , which after receiving breast - conserving treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy , radiotherapy and hormone therapy , developed four years after an inflammatory carcinoma in the same breast , with different expression of immunohistochemical markers than the first breast cancer . 
 the patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy that allowed the realization of a radical mastectomy with a complete pathological response . 
 we describe the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of ipsilateral breast tumor relapses , along with a review of existing literature .",pubmed
"aortic aneurysm ( aa ) can be life - threatening and aorta size is the best criterion for determining if an intervention is necessary to prevent ruptures , dissections or aneurysm - related deaths.1 ) however , even large aas seldom cause symptoms,2)3 ) although the incidence of aortic disease increases with age.4)5 ) therefore , it is important for clinicians to be cautious in their evaluation of patients at risk . 
 aneurysm of the ascending thoracic aorta ( ata ) most often results from cystic medial degeneration.2 ) atherosclerosis is an infrequent cause of aneurysm of ata , in contrast to that of the descending thoracic aorta ( dta ) and abdominal aorta , where atherosclerosis plays an important role in development of aa.2 ) meanwhile , thoracic aas ( taas ) and abdominal aas ( aaas ) share common risk factors , such as age and hypertension 
 . therefore , elderly male subjects with hypertension might be at high risk for both taa and aaa . 
 efforts to detect high risk populations for coronary heart disease ( chd ) have been widely applied and coronary calcium measurement using non - contrast computed tomography ( ct ) is the method of choice for assessing cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic subjects.6 ) screening for aaa using ultrasound has been recommended in elderly men who are current or past smokers,7 ) but the screening strategy for taa in elderly subjects is not well - established , even though it is a fatal disease.8)9 ) the more widespread applications of cardiac ct and thoracic ct for cardiovascular risk stratification and lung cancer screening have made it possible to measure thoracic aortic diameter using non - contrast ct , resulting in several successful case reports.10)11 ) the purpose of the current study was to use non - contrast ct in a prospective manner to explore the prevalence of aas and determine whether screening for chd and aas is necessary in a population with multiple risk factors for chd in a korean population . 
 five hundreds and two consecutive korean male hypertensive patients without history of aa were prospectively enrolled from june , 2012 to april , 2013 at the outpatient clinic of severance cardiovascular hospital ( seoul , korea ) . 
 subjects were eligible if they were 65 years old and had provided signed informed consent . of these 542 patients who had done non - contrast ct of whole aorta , 15 patients ( 2.8% ) with a history of aortic valve surgery and 30 patients ( 5.5% ) with a suboptimal ct image were excluded . 
 most of the suboptimal images were those with errors in raw ct data storage , which caused problems of analysis in the sagittal and coronal planes using reconstructed images . 
 serum calcium , phosphorus , total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein - cholesterol ( ldl - c ) , high density lipoprotein - cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , triglycerides and serum creatinine levels were measured after a minimum 12-hour fasting period . 
 hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm hg and/or diastolic blood pressure as 90 mm hg or treatment with antihypertensive agents . 
 diabetes was defined as treatment with hypoglycemic agents or insulin , or fasting glucose 126 mg / dl .

 multiple volumes were placed to cover the entire aorta from above the aortic arch to the aortic bifurcation . 
 patients underwent aorta ct with a prospective electrocardiography - gating wide - volume protocol ( from four to six volumes , according to body height ) . 
 the tube voltage was 120 kv and the effective tube current was adjusted using the adaptive iterative dose reduction three dimensional algorithm . 
 the resulting four to six individual volume data sets were automatically stitched together immediately after reconstruction to generate one ct data set of the whole aorta .

 patient demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in table 1 . the mean age was 73 years . 
 diabetes , dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease were observed in 171 patients ( 34.5% ) , 318 patients ( 64.1% ) and 256 patients ( 51.6% ) , respectively . 
 three hundred and sixty - four patients ( 73.4% ) had a history of smoking . 
 mean diameter of atamax , dtamax , tamax , and aamax was 38.44.0 mm , 28.53.0 mm , 38.94.0 , and 23.05.5 mm , respectively . 
 the prevalence of taa and aaa was 36.5% ( 181/496 ) and 6.0% ( 30/496 ) , respectively . 
 there were 16 patients ( 3.2% ) who had taa and aaa simultaneously . however , prevalence of aa suitable for an indication for intervention according to current guidelines ( tamax 55 mm and aamax 60 mm)2 ) was very low in this study . 
 those who were indicated for intervention were seen only in one case of the taa group and one case of the aaa group . 
 prevalence of taa was 64.6% in patients with aaa and 40.0% in patients without aaa . 
 patients with aaa had a higher occurrence of taa compared with those without aaa ( p=0.010 ) ( fig . 
 there was no significant difference in prevalence of taa between nonsmokers and those who had a history of smoking or were current smokers . 
 in contrast , prevalence of aaa was significantly higher in current / past smokers compared to non - smokers ( p=0.046 ) . 
 of the 365 current / past smokers , aaa was found in 27 patients ( 7.4% ) , but of the 124 non - smokers , aaa was observed in only three patients ( 2.4% ) , and there were no nonsmokers with a large aaa ( > 40 mm ) . 
 determinants for taa , aaa and both taa and aaa are shown in table 2 . in the multivariate logistic regression analysis , 
 determinants for taa were age { odds ratio ( or ) 1.059 , 95% confidence interval ( ci ) 1.018 - 1.101 , p=0.005 } , absence of dyslipidemia ( or 0.621 , 95% ci 0.418 - 0.923 , p=0.018 ) , body surface area ( or 11.92 , 95% ci 2.787 - 50.97 , p=0.001 ) , diastolic blood pressure ( or 1.029 , 95% ci 1.009 - 1.049 , p=0.004 ) and presence of aaa ( or 3.070 , 95% ci 1.398 - 6.754 , p=0.005 ) . 
 in contrast , aaa was independently associated with presence of dysplipidemia ( or 2.792 , 95% ci 1.091 - 7.143 , p=0.032 ) , current / past smokers ( or 4.074 , 95% ci 1.160 - 14.31 , p=0.028 ) and presence of taa ( or 3.367 , 95% ci 1.550 - 7.313 , p=0.002 ) . 
 aortic size is critical to key decisions regarding management of aas.12 ) this study evaluated the entire aorta diameter , from the thoracic aorta to the abdomen aorta just above the iliac bifurcation , using axial images of non - contrast ct scans in a population with multiple risk factors for both chd and aa . 
 the study population included high - risk individuals , but blood pressure and serum lipids were well controlled in most patients , as indicated by blood pressure and laboratory test results . nevertheless , prevalence of taa was considerably high and taa was associated with various clinical factors including older age , larger bsa and higher diastolic blood pressure . 
 interestingly , taa was associated with the absence of dyslipidemia , while aaa was significantly associated with the presence of dyslipidemia . 
 one possible explanation might be that the etiology of aas differs between ascending and descending aorta.1 ) that is , above the ligamentumarteriosum the disease is non - atherosclerotic , while below the ligamentumarteriosum arteriosclerosis is abundant.1 ) therefore , taa might not be associated with dyslipidemia . 
 another explanation for the conflicting results might be that the mean values of total cholesterol , ldl - c and hdl - c were almost within normal limits , suggesting the serum lipids were well controlled in most patients . 
 in addition , since the current study was performed at a tertiary referral hospital , many of the patients were taking statins for the primary or secondary prevention for coronary artery disease , not for the treatment of dyslipidemia . 
 therefore , effects of high lipids on atherosclerosis might be minimized in the studied population and result in conflicting outcomes . 
 therefore , further studies are needed to clarify the relationship among taa , aaa , dyslipidemia , serum cholesterol and statin therapy . 
 thoracic aortic aneurysm was more prevalent in patients with aaa compared to those without aaa , even after adjusting for multiple confounding factors . 
 in addition , more than one - third of the study subjects had a taa , and it was remarkably more prevalent than aaa among high - risk subjects in the current study , in contrast to previous reports that aaa is more prevalent than taa.1 ) taa prevalence continuously increases,13 ) and is thought to be related to increased age and hypertension in the general population . 
 however , most taas had a diameter < 50 mm , which is not large enough to indicate a need for immediate intervention . therefore , the clinical implications of the high prevalence of taa need further evaluation , since taas are known to be an indolent process and to grow very slowly , at approximately 0.1 cm per year.9)14 ) future studies should establish a method for aortic screening for taa and strategies for conservative as well as surgical management in elderly hypertensive patients . 
 previous studies consistently demonstrated a relationship between smoking and aaa.11 ) the present study , which involved a high - risk population of asian males , found that aaa was independently associated with smoking history in addition to dyslipidemia . 
 moreover , prevalence of aaa was 2.4% among nonsmokers , which is very low compared to previous studies involving caucasians.15)16 ) in addition , none of the nonsmokers had a large aaa ( > 40 mm ) . in population - based screening studies in japan , 
 aaa was rarely encountered17)18 ) and the prevalence of aaa was also reportedly low in chinese populations , even in patients with severe coronary artery disease.19 ) this suggests that race influences aaa prevalence and that asians generally have a low prevalence of aaa . 
 the present study also reported a low prevalence of aaa in an asian population and reinforced the impact of smoking on aaa . 
 these results high - light the need to clearly define the usefulness of routine screening for aaa among asian non - smokers . 
 the primary limitation of this study is that a ct scan with axial images could not properly evaluate the very proximal portion of the ascending aorta including the aortic root . 
 in addition , even in the sagittal and coronal planes , aortic root diameter could not be accurately measured using non - contrast ct due to the complexity of the structures surrounding the aortic root . therefore , different imaging modalities are needed to accurately detect aortic root aneurysms . 
 this study was performed in a population of elderly asian males with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular disease . 
 therefore , the results of the current study can not be applied to females , other ethnicities , or groups with a low - risk of cardiovascular disease . 
 the prevalence of aa was significant and taa was more prevalent than aaa in elderly korean males with hypertension who had multiple risk factors for chd and aa . 
 future research should establish distinct screening strategies for taa and aaa according to risk factors and ethnicity .

"in developed countries , endometrial cancer morbidity has exceeded that of cervical cancer to become the most common invasive malignancy of the female genital tract . 
 early screening methods cervical cancer have made major progress because of the improvement of cytologic preparation methods and unified evaluation system in the 1950s . 
 drawing from the successful experience of cervical carcinoma screening , we are pressed for an effective approach to screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor to reduce new cases and deaths . 
 endometrial complex hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia ( ein ) are considered as precursors of type i endometrioid adenocarcinoma , and endometrial glandular dysplasia is the precursor of type ii carcinoma . a certain period of time for these lesions developing to carcinoma 
 traditionally , endometrial samples for histologic analysis can be obtained from d & c or under hysteroscope , and these methods are considered to be reliable for evaluating the endometrial condition . to date , the adequacy of specimens obtained using the sap-1 device compared to specimens obtained by d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy , which is better for evaluating the condition of the endometrium , is unknown . 
 the aim of this study was to investigate whether liquid - based surepath preparation for endometrial cytology test ( ect ) can maintain the three - dimensional structure of the endometrium . 
 histology is the gold standard for evaluating the accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive prediction value ( ppv ) , and negative prediction value ( npv ) of ect . 
 this study was performed from november 2011 to may 2014 at the obstetrics and gynecology department of peking university first hospital and it had been approved by the hospital ethics committee . 
 the risk factors included : ( 1 ) age  40 years ; ( 2 ) intrinsically high estrogen including polycystic ovarian syndrome and ovarian tumors with an abnormal level of estrogen such as granulosa cell tumors ; ( 3 ) extrinsically high estrogen including hormone replacement therapy and postoperative breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen ; ( 4 ) high body mass index ( bmi ) 25 kg / m ; ( 5 ) hypertension , hyperlipidemia and diabetes ; ( 6 ) family history of cancer including hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer , lynch syndrome , and first - degree relatives with gynecologic tumor ; ( 7 ) history of radiation and smoking ; ( 8) abnormal uterus bleeding ( aub ) , especially postmenopausal vaginal bleeding ; ( 9 ) abnormal endometrium assessed by ultrasound as follows : thickness ( postmenopausal women 4 mm or menopausal women 20 mm ) , occupation disease of the uterine cavity or heterogeneous . while patients with following conditions were excluded out of this study : ( 1 ) ultrasound scanning suggested uterus cavity was distorted by multiple uterine myomas or adenomyoma ; ( 2 ) patients with intra - uterine device . 
 they provided written informed consent and underwent an ect using the direct sampler sap-1 device ( saipujiuzhou corporation , beijing , china ) [ figure 1 ] . 
 this device was patented and received permission to use it in our clinic in china . the sap-1 sampling device . 
 it consists of a flexible latex loop with spines on the side and a smooth tip to prevent injury to the myometrium . 
 there is an outer protective sheath outside the loop to prevent contamination from cervical and vaginal cells . 
 it is easy to operate and can be used in an outpatient setting , at health examination centers and in community hospitals . 
 steps for obtaining samples using the sap-1 device the loop with the specimen was then immersed in the surepath cell preservation container ( bd diagnostic , burlington , nc , usa ) to release the cells . 
 the 10 ml specimen was transferred into centrifuge tubes with a density reagent ( bd diagnostic , burlington , nc , usa ) to remove blood and mucus . 
 after a two - stage centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min 15 s and then 2000 rpm for 10 min 15 s ( rotina 46s , hettich corporation , german ) , the centrifuge tube was put into the surepath semi - automated slide processor and stained using papanicolaou . 
 the cytological smears were evaluated by two independent gynecological cytologists who were blinded to the study procedures . 
 based on a previously - published diagnostic system , the cytological results were subdivided into four categories as follows : negative for epithelial lesions , benign endometrium , atypical endometrial cell , and suspected for malignant [ figures 3a  d and 4a  d ] . 
 endometrial tissue samples were fixed in neutral buffered formalin , embedded in paraffin , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . 
 two gynecological pathologists independently assessed the slides , based on the world health organization diagnostic criteria and ein . 
 if a normal or benign endometrium was given , d & c or hysteroscopic pathology was regarded as a final result , we occasionally encountered a situation as cell features fall short of the criteria of simple / complex hyperplasia with atypia , we should carefully evaluated these lesions to determine whether or not a diagnosis of ein could be made . 
 ( a ) negative for endometrial lesions : long , straight tube - shaped cell clumps with a small amount of stromal cells on the margin is the most common type of cell clumps in the proliferative endometrium , observed using a low - power microscope ( papanicolaou stain , 20 ) ; ( b ) benign endometrium : dilated and branched cell clumps are always seen . 
 the contour of the cell clumps is smooth and occasionally a few stromal cells can be observed ( papanicolaou stain , 40 ) ; ( c ) atypical endometrial cell : double - layer or folded irregular cell clumps are observed ( papanicolaou stain , 20 ) ; ( d ) suspected endometrial carcinoma : papillo - shaped bordered cell clumps with atypical cells can be observed ( papanicolaou stain , 100 ) . 
 ( a ) negative for endometrial lesion : regularly arranged and mono - layer endometrial cells with an oval or round nucleus . 
 the spaces between nuclei are regular , and the chromatin in endometrial cells is delicate ( papanicolaou stain , 100 ) ; ( b ) benign endometrium : crowded cells arranged into a single layer with delicate chromatin and a small nucleolus ( papanicolaou stain , 100 ) ; ( c ) atypical endometrial cell : the spaces in atypical cells are heterogeneous . 
 the chromatin is coarse ( papanicolaou stain , 100 ) ; ( d ) suspected carcinoma : variable size cells with obviously round nucleoli . 
 the contingency table chi - square test was used to compare the adequacy of specimens collected using sap-1 with those collected via d & c and hysteroscopic biopsy . 
 negative for epithelial lesions and benign endometrium were considered negative , while atypical endometrial cells and suspected for malignant were considered positive . 
 histopathologic results were the gold standard . a four - fold table was created to calculate the accuracy , sensitive , specificity , ppv , and npv .

 the current study comprised of 1514 patients with endometrial carcinoma risk factors underwent sap-1 sampling on an outpatient basis , and 375 of these women also underwent d & c or hysteroscopy . 
 characteristics including age distribution , menstrual status , and patients symptoms and signs are presented in table 1 . 
 most of the patients were over 40 years of age in both the cytology and histopathology groups ( 91.2% and 90.7% , respectively ) . 
 the percentage of postmenopausal women was 69% and 63.5% , respectively , in the two groups . among 1514 cases with cytological specimens , 576 ( 38% ) patients had aub , and 910 ( 60.1% ) had  4 mm thickness endometrium measured by ultrasound . 
 169 ( 45.1% ) out of 375 patients with histopathology had aub , and 245 patients ( 65.3% ) had  4 mm thickness endometrium . 
 patient characteristics aub : abnormal uterus bleeding ; some patients were not examined by ultrasound , and their endometrial thickness is missing . as presented in table 2 , 1458 patients ( 96.3% ) had adequate specimens for cytology out of the 1514 patients sampled using sap-1 , while 285 cases ( 76% ) had adequate specimens for pathology out of the 375 patients who underwent d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy . 
 there were 56 ( 3.7% ) cytology and 90 ( 24% ) biopsies that were inadequate . 
 sap-1 can provide more sufficient materials for cytology than d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy for histology ( p < 0.01 ) . 
 adequate and inadequate specimens obtained using cytology and biopsy of the 469 cytology specimens from premenopausal women , 452 patients ( 96.4% ) had an adequate specimen , and 17 patients ( 3.6% ) had an inadequate specimen . while in 137 cases of premenopausal women obtained biopsy specimens , 132 patients ( 96.4% ) had an adequate biopsy , and only 5 patients ( 3.6% ) had an inadequate biopsy . 
 there was no difference ( p = 0.919 ) between cytology and biopsy in premenopausal women . 
 however , 1006 specimens ( 86.3% ) were adequate , and 37 specimens ( 3.7% ) were inadequate out of the 1045 cytology samples obtained using sap-1 in postmenopausal women . in 238 biopsy specimens obtained from postmenopausal women , 153 biopsy specimens ( 64.3% ) were adequate , and 85 specimens ( 35.7% ) were inadequate . 
 it was easier to collect cytology specimens than histology specimens ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 patients with both cytologic and histologic results n = 254 patients ; negative and benign were served as negative ; atypia and carcinoma were as positive . of the 254 patients who had both of cytology and histology , 205 ( 80.7% ) 
 11 ( 4.3% ) patients were evaluated as positive by cytology , but they were confirmed as negative or benign lesions using histology . there were 28 patients who were positive for atypical cells , as determined by both cytology and histology . 
 there were 10 ( 3.9% ) patients who were diagnosed as negative or benign using cytology , while their occult lesions were discovered upon subsequent hysterectomy . 
 the accuracy of cytology for detecting endometrial precursor and carcinoma was estimated at 91.7% , sensitivity at 73.6% , specificity at 94.9% , ppv at 71.9% , and npv at 95.3% . 
 in past decades , endometrial carcinoma has become the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy in developed cities such as beijing , shanghai , and guangzhou in china . 
 the increased morbidity of endometrial carcinoma is attributed to changes in lifestyle , such as a lack of exercise and increasing fat intake lead to obesity and high bmi . 
 obesity triggered several pathways including hormonal imbalance and hyperactive proliferative pathways to involve in pathogenesis of endometrial carcinoma . 
 the effective procedure for reducing morbidity and mortality in endometrial carcinoma is to screen certain groups with risk factors and design a reliable tool suitable for a mass screening program . 
 dilation and curettage have been used clinically for many years , and originally it was intended to serve as a screening tool for endometrial carcinoma , but researchers realized that specimen adequacy and diagnosis accuracy were unsatisfactory . 
 yarandi et al . reported that the accuracy of d & c was 40.5% , sensitivity 40.5% , specificity 72.3% , ppv 77.1% and npv 25.1% , and in 52.7% of the patients , d & c failed to detect intrauterine disorders , especially focal lesions of the endometrium . 
 moreover , most patients complained of pain and severe discomfort during the operation , and they had persistent bleeding for several days after the procedure . in mossa 
 's study , the patients undergoing d & c had higher pain scores compared with those who underwent brush cytology . 
 currently , several sampling devices were used to take endometrium cytology samples from patients ; samplers include endoflower , tao brush , and endocyte . for tao brush sampling , 
 estimated that out of 519 patients , the samples of biopsy obtained using the tao brush was inadequate in 361 patients ( 39% ) , and samples obtained using the endoflower were inadequate in 15 patients ( 2% ) . 
 in addition , buccoliero et al . showed the same results in another study that compared the endoflower to biopsy in patients receiving tamoxifen . 
 sap-1 , a direct endometrial sampler device , is especially designed for minimal pain during sampling , it meets the requirements for endometrial samplers , which include : ( 1 ) avoiding contamination from the endocervix and vagina ; ( 2 ) procuring an adequate representative sample of the entire endometrium to detect focal lesions ; and ( 3 ) the procedure should be safe , easy to use , and well - tolerated by the patients . 
 the device has to be noninvasive or minimally invasive , cost - effective , and user - friendly to be accepted by primary care physicians and patients for repeated tests 
 . a soft loop can be flexible within the endometrial cavity , and the spindles can easily obtain adequate endometrial cells with minimal chance of injuring myometrium and bleeding . 
 we are the first to evaluate the adequacy of its specimens compared with d & c and hysteroscopic biopsy . in the current study , 
 adequate specimens obtained using the sap-1 sampler ( 96.3% ) are superior to those obtained using d & c ( 76% ) . 
 in addition , most patients experienced no pain during sap-1 sampling , claiming that they had the same feeling as the insertion of a cytobrush for cervical sampling . 
 our previously - proposed screening strategy involved women of 40 years of age or older , or postmenopausal women as the target screening population . in buccoliero 
 's study , of 107 asymptomatic postmenopausal women with a thin endometrium ( < 4 mm ) , a biopsy obtained sufficient material for the diagnosis in only 24% of the cases . 
 our study also shows that there are no differences in specimen adequacy between the sap-1 sampler and d & c in premenopausal women . 
 however , for postmenopausal women , the sap-1 sampler provides more adequate specimens than does d & c or hysteroscopic biopsy . 
 conventional smears have not been widely applied in endometrial carcinoma screening attributes of overlapping cells and a heavy background . 
 in addition , the three - dimensional structure is an important ect reference to evaluate the condition of the endometrium 
 . requirements for a stable fixation system and preparation technique include : ( 1 ) preserving the morphology of endometrial epithelial and stromal cells and the endometrial glandular structure ; and ( 2 ) eliminating obscuring factors such as excess red blood cells , mucus , overlapping cells , and inflammatory cells . the 95% alcohol fixation and conventional cytology can not earn a place in endometrial cancer screen due to regression cells and high background levels , such as excess blood , mucus , overlapping cells , and inflammatory cells . according to previous japanese publications , 
 conventional cytology was initially used to examine the endometrial lesion , with a sensitivity about 78% , specificity of 95% , ppv of 56% , and npv of 98% . 
 transvaginal ultrasonography was previously thought to be an efficient tool because of conventional cytology 's low accuracy . compared with a conventional smear , 
 thin - layer cytology provided more cell clumps and a clearer background , as shown by norimatsu et al . to improve the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial cytology , 
 remondi et al . used the endoflower sampler and the thinprep preparation to evaluate 768 postmenopausal women , and found an accuracy of 93.6% , sensitivity of 92% , specificity of 95% , ppv of 73% , and npv of 99% . 
 the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , and npv for the uterobrush were 88.9% , 100% , 100% and 98.9% , respectively . 
 direct uterine sampling with the tao brush sampler using a liquid - based preparation method for detection of endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia , the sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 66% . 
 the results of the current study demonstrate that the sap-1 sampler combined with the liquid - based surepath preparation method is a reliable diagnostic method . 
 the overall accuracy for detecting endometrial cancer , complex hyperplasia with atypia and ein was 92.4% , with a sensitivity of 73% , a specificity of 95.8% , a ppv of 75% , and a npv of 95.3% . 
 almost all patients enrolled into this study received the ect for screening , so women with positive cytologic results or persistent bleeding underwent hysteroscopic biopsy or d & c. in the current study , patients with carcinoma that was subsequently confirmed by histology were initially diagnosed with atypical endometrial cells or suspected carcinoma using cytology . 
 the main reasons that the accuracy of this study was lower than that in previously studies are as follows : patients with positive results including atypical cells underwent hysteroscopic biopsy and d & c , and some of them were subsequently diagnosed as normal or benign . 
 in addition , other methods , including enlarging the sample quantity to collect more information to correctly distinguish focal atypical endometrial lesions from benign lesions , should be investigated using immunohistochemistry and biochemistry to improve the accuracy of endometrial cytology . in conclusion 
 , the sap-1 sampler combined with surepath preparation may become a reliable method for screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor , especially in postmenopausal and asymptomatic women . 
 if this screening procedure can be used in the high risk - factor women , some unnecessary d & c may be avoided , and asymptomatic women with the precursor may benefit from early detection and management .","background : the aim of this study was to compare specimen adequacy of sap-1 provided for cytology with that of dilation and curettage ( d & c ) or hysteroscopy for histology , and evaluate the accuracy of combining endometrium sampling by sap-1 and liquid - based cytology using surepath preparation for screening endometrial carcinoma and its precursor.methods:endometrial specimens from women ( n = 1514 ) with risk factors were obtained using an sap-1 device for cytological analysis ; histological samples were obtained from 375 of these women who underwent d & c or hysteroscopy . 
 cytological specimens were prepared to liquid - based smear using surepath technology and stained by papanicolaou . 
 histological samples were processed in routine pathology and stained by hematoxylin and eosin.results:adequate specimens for cytology were obtained from 1458/1541 patients ( 96.3% ) , while adequate samples for pathology were obtained from 285/375 patients ( 76% ) . however , for postmenopausal women , 1006 of 1045 cytology ( 86.3% ) were adequate , 153 of 238 histology ( 64.3% ) were adequate , it was easier to collect cytological specimens than histological specimens ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 the accuracy of endometrial cytology for detecting endometrial carcinoma and its precursor was 92.4% ( sensitivity , 73% ; specificity , 95.8% ; positive predictive value , 75% ; and negative predictive value , 95.3%).conclusions : endometrial cytology using sap-1 sampling and surepath preparation may be a reliable approach for screening patients with endometrial carcinoma and its precursor .",pubmed
"the global population , especially those in developed countries , is getting older and this trend is predicted to continue in the coming decades [ 1 , 2 ] . 
 some have defined aging as a decreased ability to resist cellular stresses or insults [ 3 , 4 ] , and in fact , aging is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors for predisposing conditions such as diabetes , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia . 
 accordingly , the incidence and prevalence of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular diseases increase dramatically with age , making cardiovascular disease the most common cause of death among the elderly . 
 the endothelium has a primary role in adjusting vascular function by the production of nitric oxide ( no ) and other biologically active vasodilator materials   that decrease vascular resistance , inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation , and decrease vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation . 
 alterations in the control of these processes , a feature of endothelial dysfunction , often leads to atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders   that are accompanied by a proinflammatory , proliferative , and procoagulatory state . the endothelium is ideally placed to bear the brunt of hemodynamic stresses , oxidized lipids , and oxidative radicals , all of which increase their vulnerability to aging . 
 this is true not only in healthy subjects without underlying risk factors , but also in older people   and those with cardiovascular risk factors . 
 indeed , those with cardiovascular risk factor / disease will benefit more . for instance , eight weeks of exercise significantly improve endothelial function , as measured by flow - mediated dilation , in diabetic patients   but not in healthy subjects . 
 although there are clear health benefits of exercise in the elderly , a detailed understanding of the molecular basis underlying these improvements remains incomplete . in this minireview , we discuss some mechanisms thought to be involved in endothelial aging . 
 we focus on the role of oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation and the role of exercise in boosting antioxidative and anti - inflammatory mechanisms . 
 the endothelial cells form a monolayer that lines blood vessels to form an interface between circulating blood and the smooth muscle layer . 
 in addition to its barrier function , the endothelium modulates coagulation , growth , and inflammation throughout the circulatory system 
 . it also contributes to adjusting tissue perfusion by secreting several vasoactive substances , which can be vasoconstrictors ( endothelin-1 , angiotensin ii , thromboxane a2 , etc . ) or vasodilators ( no , prostacyclin , and endothelium - derived hyperpolarizing factor ( edhf ) , etc . ) . among the many vasoactive agents released by the endothelium , no has been characterized in greatest detail . 
 it is released in response to a variety of chemical and physical stimuli to cause vasodilation , such that one of the most common methods for assessing endothelial health is by determining vascular capacity to produce no . 
 no is produced by the catalytic activity of no synthase ( nos ) , which transforms l - arginine to l - citrulline . 
 all isoforms of nos require five cofactors / prosthetic groups : flavin adenine dinucleotide ( fad ) , flavin mononucleotide ( fmn ) , heme , tetrahydrobiopterin ( bh4 ) , and ca / calmodulin . 
 calcium is required for the activation of neuronal nos ( nnos ) and endothelial nos ( enos ) but not for the activity of inducible nos ( inos ) . 
 enos binds to caveolin-1 in endothelial cell caveolae , a subset of specialized lipid domains that form invaginations and so increase intracellular microdomains where organelles and anchoring proteins aggregate . 
 caveolin-1 inhibits enos activity , and this interaction is regulated by ca / calmodulin . upon agonist activation , the increases in intracellular calcium results in ca 
 / calmodulin binding , which then displaces caveolin and reverses its inhibitory interaction with enos . 
 mechanical stimuli such as shear stress and vascular smooth muscle stretch also raise intracellular calcium concentrations . 
 several chemical events such as interaction with ca / calmodulin , heat shock protein 90 , and subsequent association of akt results in enos phosphorylation at ser1177 are involved in no production . 
 released no causes vasorelaxation , which in turn results in increased blood flow and reduced blood pressure , inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation , inhibition of leukocyte adhesion , reduction in smooth muscle proliferation , and retardation of atherogenesis . 
 endothelial dysfunction is defined as functional alterations in endothelial physiology characterized by reduction of vasodilator substance output ( in particular no ) and augmentation in endothelium - derived contracting factors . 
 this imbalance leads to a vasoconstrictive , hypercoagulative , proliferative , and proinflammatory state , so favoring atherosclerosis . over time 
 , most humans are exposed to a variety of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors , such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance , obesity , altered lipid profile , hypertension , and glomerulosclerosis . 
 . bed rest of about 48 hours induces vascular dysfunction , which is then followed by insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and increased blood pressure . 
 thus , shortening of hospital stays and bed confinement periods are highly beneficial in the elderly . 
 bed rest also increases circulating endothelial cells , possibly due to increased endothelial cell apoptosis resulting from reduced shear stress during bed rest . 
 , as long as the damage is minimal or maintenance systems work properly as in young subjects , the functional capacity of the endothelium is preserved . in cases of severe damage , injured cells are omitted by a poorly described mechanism and replaced by dividing neighboring cells . circulating progenitor endothelial cells also play a role in the repair mechanisms of injured endothelial cells . 
 however , as part of the aging processes , the cumulative effects of stresses coupled with the inevitable metabolic changes that occur with time , there is a decline in the function and repair capacity of the endothelium . 
 since endothelial cells can only undergo a limited number of divisions , they eventually enter a state of senescence , which is an endogenous and hereditary process of biological aging , in which cells are still metabolically active , but express a pro - inflammatory , prooxidative , and proatherogenic phenotype . 
 the cumulative effects of these parameters strongly promote a decline in the functional capacity of endothelium . 
 all forms of cardiovascular disease have an increased prevalence in the elderly , even in those free of cardiovascular risk factors . since there are no changes in endothelium - independent vasodilation in older humans and animals , it is reasonable to suggest that vascular age - dependent endothelial changes largely reflect the release no , although there are also some changes in the production and release of other endothelial derived vasodilators such as prostacyclin and edhf , along with increases in vasoconstrictor prostanoids . 
 there are also several age - related structural changes in endothelium such as increases in the expression of adhesion molecules , permeability , sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli , with decreases in angiogenic and regenerative capacities [ 43 , 44 ] . 
 oxidative stress is an imbalance between production of oxidizing agents , such as free radicals , and opposing antioxidant systems which scavenge or metabolize those reactive agents . 
 free radicals are reactive chemical molecules having a single unpaired electron in an outer orbit . 
 this unstable configuration provides energy which is released through reactions with adjacent molecules such as proteins , lipids , carbohydrates , and nucleic acids . 
 oxygen - free radicals or , more generally , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , as well as reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) , are products of normal cellular metabolism . 
 oxidative stress interferes with endothelial function in different ways , but the most prominent mechanism is via reduction of no bioavailability , which is the net product of the rate of no production and its degradation by superoxide .   in the case of no generation , reduced vasoconstrictive responses to the nos inhibitor n(g)-monomethyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) in older patients   and reduced shear stress - induced no release and vasodilation in older animals   suggest decreased production of no in aged endothelium . in spite of these 
 , direct measurements of enos in aged animals were inconclusive , as raised , fallen , or unchanged levels have been reported [ 4952 ] . 
 the increased production of superoxide anions in the aging vascular wall rapidly inactivates no [ 53 , 54 ] . 
 cyclooxygenase ( cox ) and nadph - oxidase have central roles in ros production [ 47 , 5558 ] . 
 removal of the endothelium or inhibition of nadph - oxidase reduces vascular superoxide generation in the aorta of aged wistar - kyoto rats . 
 superoxide rapidly reacts with no to generate cytotoxic peroxynitrite ( onoo ) , a reaction with several consequences . 
 first , onoo alters the function of biomolecules by protein nitration as well as by causing lipid peroxidation . 
 for example , potassium channels , which hyperpolarize vascular cells and mediate regulate vasorelaxation , are inhibited by nitration [ 60 , 61 ] . 
 second , onoo causes single - strand dna breakage , which in turn activates nuclear enzyme poly(adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) ( a nuclear dna - repair enzyme ) . 
 third , it decreases no bioavailability causing impaired relaxation and inhibition of the antiproliferative effects of no . 
 furthermore , onoo  oxidizes bh4 , an important cofactor for nos , leading to the uncoupling of enos and causing it to produce superoxide instead of no . 
 ros - induced peroxidation of membrane lipids alters the structure and the fluidity of biological membranes , so having global detrimental effects on vascular function . 
 the role of oxidative stress in aged endothelial dysfunction is shown by the ability of vitamin c to restore the impaired vasodilatory response to acetylcholine only in subjects aged 60 years or older . 
 this indicates that oxidative stress is a critical mechanism for endothelial dysfunction only in older subjects . 
 administration of bh4 also improves flow - mediated dilatation ( fmd ) in older sedentary subjects , while having no beneficial effects in young or older trained people . 
 all cells have evolved highly complex enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems that act synergistically to defend the body from free radical - induced damage . the most efficient enzymatic antioxidants are glutathione peroxidase , catalase , superoxide dismutase , heme oxygenase-1 ( ho-1 ) , nad(p)h quinone oxidoreductase-1 ( nqo-1 ) , and thioredoxin . 
 nonenzymatic antioxidants include vitamins e and c , thiol antioxidants ( glutathione , thioredoxin ) . 
 attenuation of antioxidant defense mechanisms during the aging process has been proposed in some studies . 
 for instance , reduced concentration of plasma sod , but not cellular sod , occurs in rats . 
 higher production of peroxynitrite causes antioxidant enzyme deactivation , as is the case for manganese sod ( mnsod ) in mitochondria . 
 levels of protein expression and enzymatic activity of glutathione peroxidase 1 ( gpx-1 ) are lower in proangiogenic endothelial progenitor cells ( derived from cultured blood mononuclear cells ) from older subjects . 
 atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease that is mediated by monocyte - derived macrophages which accumulate in arterial plaques and become activated to release cytokines that cause tissue damage . as evidence accumulates favoring the role of inflammation during the different phases of atherosclerosis 
 , it is likely that markers of inflammation such as high sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) could be increasingly used to provide additional insights on the biological status of atherosclerotic lesions . 
 elevations of crp are considered independent predictors of cardiovascular events and of the outcome of acute coronary syndromes . besides their roles markers of systemic inflammation and as predictors of cardiovascular risk , crp and other inflammatory cytokines also directly trigger vascular dysfunction , possibly by altering calcium channel expression and activity , upregulating of rho - kinase expression and function , increasing ros production , and/or enhancing cox expression . in turn , 
 cox - derived constrictor prostanoid(s ) products cause vascular hypercontractility [ 74 , 75 ] and increased formation of ros . 
 increases in cox - induced ros production and the expression of proinflammatory mediators , such as il-1b , il-6 , tnf- , cox-2 , and inos , occur during aging . 
 the nf-b pathway is a critical component of inflammatory processes activated by oxidative stress [ 33 , 78 ] . 
 nf-b is an ubiquitous transcription factor with multiple roles such as mediating inflammatory responses to a variety of signals , immune function , endothelial cell activation , and control of cell growth [ 7981 ] . 
 nf-b is normally located in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by virtue of binding to a family of inhibitory nf-b ( ib ) proteins . upon cell stimulation by a wide variety of stimuli , signals responsive 
 ikk- and ikk- ( also known as ikk-1 and ikk-2 ) are activated , which results in the phosphorylation of ib and its proteasomal degradation . 
 ib degradation liberates nf-b , allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and induce gene expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 , tnf- , cox-2 , lipoxygenase , inos , and adhesion molecules ( vcam-1 , icam-1 , pcam , e - selectin ) . 
 aging increases nf-b levels due to activation of ikk/ and degradation of ib . under usual conditions , 
 the activation of nf-b during inflammation is temporary and limited . in aging , however , a chronic and self - perpetuating condition exists . 
 proteins such as tnf- , il-1 , il-6 , and cox-2 that are nf-b induced also activate nf-b production , thus creating a vicious cycle . 
 aging increases plasma levels of tnf- , il-6 , il-1 , crp , and inflammatory blood cells [ 8486 ] . 
 the plasma concentration of il-6 correlates with senile neural atrophy   and inflammatory diseases , such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis . 
 plasma levels of tnf- and il-6 are also predictors of disability and mortality among elderly . 
 the significance of exercise as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease is widely acknowledged . physical inactivity and poor diet , preceded only by tobacco , 
 are the leading causes of death . the american college of sports medicine , defines exercise as  any and all activity involving generation of force by the activated muscle(s ) that results in disruption of a homeostatic state  . 
 endurance exercise is characterized by prolonged and continuous periods of contractile activity ( high repetition ) against low resistance . 
 resistance exercise ( also termed strength training ) involves short periods of contractile activity ( low repetition ) against a high opposing resistance . 
 sprint exercise consists of short periods of maximal ( intense ) repetitive contractile activity with a low interval and against a low resistance , for example , running 100  m sprint race . 
 however , sprint training can also be performed against high resistance resulting in a combination of resistance and endurance modalities , for example , running with added weights . increased physical activity and fitness , of both men and women , 
 some studies even suggest greater benefits ( up to 50% risk reduction ) for exercise in terms of all - cause mortality and death from cardiovascular disease . 
 follow - up study evaluated the relationship between physical activity and risk of all - cause mortality in a large number of elderly ( 7080 women aged 7075 and 11668 men aged 6583 ) . 
 they found an inverse dose - response relationship between exercise and all - cause mortality . 
 risk reductions were 3050% higher in females than in males in every category of exercise intensity . 
 this study clearly shows that there are clear health benefits from all levels of physical activity . 
 regular aerobic exercise can slow down the age - related losses in endothelial function   supposedly by restoration of no availability consequent to prevention of ros production . 
 aging is associated with a limited capacity of the vasculature to release no , as older subjects show reduced levels of plasma nitrite in response to exercise . the difference in plasma nitrate / nitrite ratio between older and young sedentary subjects 
 heat - stimulated hand and foot skin increased blood flow are higher in trained older subjects compared to sedentary matched controls and are correlated with nitrate / nitrite ratios , suggesting better endothelial function secondary to greater no bioavailability . 
 trained elderly subjects also exhibit higher flow - mediated brachial artery dilation compared to sedentary counterparts . 
 table 1 summarizes the findings of recent clinical studies on the endothelial benefits of exercise in the elderly . 
 exercise training upregulates antioxidant defense mechanisms in several tissues , presumably due to increased levels of oxidative stress that occurs during exercise . 
 exercise - induced production of ros is proposed to evoke specific adaptations such as increasing repair mechanisms for oxidative damage , increasing resistance to oxidative stress , and lowering levels of oxidative damage . on the other hand , excessive production of ros can have detrimental effects . boosting levels of intrinsic antioxidant 
 potential and reduction in lipid peroxidation occur in healthy elderly men after habitual physical activity . 
 a critical role has recently been described for a transcription factor  nuclear factor ( erythroid - derived 2)-like 2 ( nrf2 )  against oxidative stress . 
 normally , nrf2 is located in the cytoplasm and kept dormant by the cytoplasmic repressor kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1 ) . a variety of activators , including oxidative free radicals , release , and translocate nrf2 into the nucleus where it regulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as nqo-1 , glutathione - s - transferase , glutathione peroxidase , and ho-1 . 
 diminished nrf2 activity contributes to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to endothelial dysfunction , insulin resistance , and abnormal angiogenesis as observed in diabetics . 
 ho-1 , which is mainly induced through the nrf2-keap1 signaling pathway ( also known as heat shock protein 32 ) , is the inducible isoform of heme oxygenase that catalyzes nadph - dependent decomposition of heme to carbon monoxide ( co ) , ferrous iron , and biliverdin . 
 three isoforms of ho have been identified : both ho-2 and ho-3 are 33-kda constitutively expressed isoforms . 
 an important role of ho-1 in the antioxidant defense system arises from an induction of ferritin synthesis that diminishes the cellular pool of free iron   and also from the enhancement of bilirubin levels , which are potent antioxidants . 
 carbon monoxide activates soluble guanylate cyclase , a key enzyme in the cell signaling cascade leading to relaxation of smooth muscle , and thrombocyte disaggregation . 
 ho-1 is a sensitive and reliable marker of oxidative stress   and cytoplasmic expression levels of ho-1 increase in leukocytes of endurance - trained male subjects after a half - marathon run . 
 there is a paradoxical increased expression of ho-1 in a control group of untrained men at rest , suggesting that the downregulation of the baseline expression of ho-1 in athletes reflects an adaptation mechanism to regular exercise training . 
 the direct effect of exercise on nrf2 expression has received much less attention except for a report that exercise increases nuclear levels of nrf2 in the proximal renal tubules of old rats . 
 the increased expression of enos after exercise both in animals and human beings [ 111114 ] also occurs in patients with stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure [ 115 , 116 ] . 
 exercise - induced upregulation of vascular enos expression is closely related to the frequency and the intensity of physical forces within the vasculature , especially shear stress . 
 shear stress is the product of all the perpendicular and parallel flow - mediated forces on endothelial cells . 
 the types of these hemodynamic forces , either laminar or oscillatory , greatly impact the function and properties of endothelial cells and also determine the signal transduction pathways that are activated . 
 laminar flow , which is augmented during moderate and intense physical activities , upregulates enos expression  while oscillatory forces , which are associated with hypertension , leads to increased nadph - oxidase activity and augments oxidative stress . 
 the mechanotransduction mechanisms that sense physical forces to cause altered gene expression are not completely described . 
 some reports suggest that activation of inward rectifying k cannels , followed by stimulation of outwardly rectifying cl channels , plays a major role in this process . 
 membrane hyperpolarization , due to inward kcurrents , drives extracellular ca into the cells through two shear stress - dependent ion channels ( p2x purinoceptors and transient receptor potential channels ) . 
 raised intracellular calcium levels lead to a dissociation of caveolae - bound enos and increased production of no . 
 other intracellular events are also thought to mediate increased no production in response to shear stress ; however , the relative importance of these mechanisms is not clear ( table 2 ) 
 . increased no synthesis secondary to amplified shear stress induces extracellular superoxide dismutase ( sod ) expression in a positive feedback manner so as to inhibit the degradation of no by ros . 
 another parallel mechanism that participates in this harmony is the upregulation of enos through exercise - induced ros production , since exercise - induced increases in shear stress stimulates vascular production of ros by an endothelium dependent pathway . 
 superoxides are rapidly converted to h2o2 by sod ; hydrogen peroxide then diffuses through the vascular wall and increases the expression and activity of enos [ 120 , 121 ] . 
 thus , increased expression of sod1 and sod3 ( which facilitate the generation of h2o2 from superoxide ) augments the effect of h2o2 on exercise - induced enos expression . on the other hand , enos expression 
 another putative mechanism is exercise - induced increases in arterial compliance which is mediated by reduction of plasma et-1 concentration as well as the elimination of et-1 mediated vascular tone . 
 twelve weeks of aerobic exercise training increase arterial compliance , while decreasing plasma et-1 levels . 
 moreover , the increase in central arterial compliance observed with et - receptor blockade before the exercise intervention was eliminated after exercise training . 
 these results indicate that endogenous et-1 participates in the beneficial influence of regular aerobic exercise on central arterial compliance . 
 exercise produces a short - term inflammatory response that is accompanied by leukocytosis , increases in oxidative stress and plasma levels of crp . 
 this proinflammatory response is followed by a long - term anti - inflammatory adaptive response . 
 regular exercise reduces crp , il-6 , and tnf- levels while increasing anti - inflammatory substances such as il-4 and il-10 [ 125 , 126 ] . 
 controlling the release and activity of at least two cytokines , tnf- and il-6 , could contribute to the natural protective effects of physical activity . 
 interleukine-6 ( il-6 ) is the first cytokine to be released into the circulation during exercise , and its levels increase in an exponential fashion in response to exercise . 
 contracting skeletal muscles upregulate levels of il-6 mrna   and the transcriptional rate of the il-6 gene is also markedly enhanced by exercise . 
 il-6 acts as both a proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokine : when secreted by t cells and macrophages , il-6 stimulates the immune response and boosts inflammatory reactions , while muscle - produced il-6 exerts anti - inflammatory effects through its inhibitory effects on tnf- and il-1 , and activation of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( il-1ra ) and il-10 . 
 il-10 in turn reduces the production of several proinflammatory cytokines , such as tnf- and il-1 . 
 exercise - induced increases in plasma il-6 correlate with the muscle mass involved in exercise activity and the mode , duration , and intensity of exercise , and this is especially the case in older individuals . 
 in addition , starkie et al . report that infusion of recombinant human il-6 ( rhil-6 ) into human subjects simulated exercise induced an il-6 response in the prevention of endotoxin - induced increase in plasma tnf- . 
 exercise also suppresses tnf- production by an il-6 independent pathway , as there are modest decreases in plasma tnf- after exercise in il-6 knockout mice . 
 in addition , il-6 enhances lipid turnover and stimulates lipolysis as well as fat oxidation via activation of amp - activated protein kinase . 
 mice deficient in il-6 ( il6/ ) develop mature onset obesity and have disturbed carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that is partly reversed by il-6 replacement . 
 the lipolytic effect of il-6 on fat metabolism was confirmed in two clinical studies of healthy and diabetic subjects [ 137 , 139 ] . 
 visceral fat is potentially a cause of low - grade systemic inflammation , which in turn leads to insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , and atherosclerosis . during exercise , il-6 also increases hepatic glucose production . 
 glucose ingestion during exercise reduces il-6 production by muscles , suggesting that il-6 is released by a reduction in glycogen levels during endurance exercise and the consequent adrenergic stimulation of il-6 gene transcription via protein kinase a activation . 
 this cytokine exerts anabolic effects in muscles by inducing protein synthesis and inhibiting protein degradation [ 130 , 142 ] . in some animal studies , 
 this cytokine prevents muscle wasting by attenuating apoptotic dna fragmentation and downregulating tnf - driven apoptotic pathways . in agreement with this , four weeks of exercise reduce the extent of tnf - triggered myocyte apoptosis in old rats [ 144 , 145 ] 
 aging is an important independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease , which is manifest as endothelial dysfunction . 
 a large body of evidence underlines the importance of oxidative stress and inflammation as prominent features of the aging process . reduced no bioavailability and decreased responsiveness to other endothelial - derived vasodilators 
 promote a vasoconstrictive , hypercoagulative , and proliferative state which favors the development of atherosclerosis . 
 vascular oxidative stress is the product of increased reactive oxygen species , such as superoxides , and reduced antioxidant defense . 
 oxidative stress - induced damage promotes a chronic inflammatory state which perpetuates a vicious cycle of endothelial dysfunction . 
 exercise training prevents and restores age - related impairment of endothelial function , possibly by the restoration of no availability consequent to prevention of oxidative stress and alleviating inflammatory processes .","the endothelium plays a critical role in the maintenance of cardiovascular health by producing nitric oxide and other vasoactive materials . 
 aging is associated with a gradual decline in this functional aspect of endothelial regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis . 
 indeed , age is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and is in part an important factor in the increased exponential mortality rates from vascular disease such as myocardial infarction and stroke that occurs in the ageing population . 
 there are a number of mechanisms suggested to explain age - related endothelial dysfunction . 
 however , recent scientific studies have advanced the notion of oxidative stress and inflammation as the two major risk factors underlying aging and age - related diseases . 
 regular physical activity , known to have a favorable effect on cardiovascular health , can also improve the function of the ageing endothelium by modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory processes , as we discuss in this paper .",pubmed
"posterior transpedicular pedicle screw fixation is widely used for obtaining internal fixation for management of the unstable spine mainly caused by trauma , and burst fractures comprise 1020% of such injuries.1 the aims of surgery in these fracture cases include decompression of the neural components , fracture reduction , and providing a stable fixation until arthrodesis is achieved . 
 transpedicular short - segment fixation became popular after the introduction of transpedicular screws by roy - camille23 and the internal fixator by dick.4 this approach includes pedicle screw fixation one vertebra above and one vertebra below the fracture . 
 short - segment spinal instrumentation has been beneficial in the management of thoracolumbar spinal fractures for better correction of kyphotic deformity , greater initial stability , early painless mobilization , and indirect decompression of the spinal canal.57 despite the advantages of this approach , it is also associated with loss of reduction and instrumentation failure in some cases.49 in an attempt to achieve stiffer short - segment constructs , some surgeons add pedicle screws at the fractured vertebra . 
 these screws can be termed  intermediate screws .  according to several biomechanical and clinical studies , monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws inserted at the level of fractured vertebrae , along with the segmental fixation of burst fractures , improved biomechanical stability of the construct.1012 in the past 20 years , the design and implantation techniques of the pedicle screw systems have been modified to reduce the rate of pedicle screw breakage and to facilitate easy application of the connecting rod without undue stress on the construct.1316 the polyaxial head coupling of the pedicle screw was found to reduce the compression bending strength at the screw  rod mount , in comparison with a monoaxial screw design.1516 based on research findings , use of the intermediate screw in conjunction with short - segment fixation for fracture reduction and kyphosis correction carries the additional advantages of construct stabilization , lordosis restoration , and preventing screw breakage.10 however , there have been few reports regarding short - segment fixation , which have compared the biomechanical performance of polyaxial versus monoaxial pedicle screws with or without an intermediate screw at the fractured vertebra . 
 this study utilized a calf experimental model of an unstable burst fracture to compare the stiffness of a short - segment pedicle fixation using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws placed at the level of fracture . 
 twelve fresh - frozen calf lumbar specimens ( l1l5 ) were obtained from a regional slaughterhouse . 
 all specimens were wrapped in doubled plastic bags and stored frozen at 20c . before biomechanical testing 
 , the specimens were thawed at room temperature in a humidity - controlled environment for 8 h. the soft tissues were removed by dissection , leaving the ligaments , facet joint capsules , and intervertebral discs intact . 
 the end vertebrae were trimmed , fixed with plain screws , and embedded in liquid self - curing denture base material and denture base resin ( type ii ) . 
 each pot included a 10-mm screw secured to a metal plate that was incorporated in the resin cast . 
 this screw was located at the level of the middle column of the vertebrae and was used as an anchor for the testing machine . 
 the resin was left to cure for 30 min . to avoid the influence of air exposure on biomechanical behavior , 
 handling experimental material routinely used in in vitro biomechanical investigation in this manner , does not alter the material characteristics of the bone and soft tissues . 
 after the intact spine was tested for flexibility , an unstable burst fracture was created in the l3 vertebra using the pre - injury and the dropped - mass technique . 
 a 2-mm drill bit was used to create holes in the l3 vertebral body with v - shaped corpectomy [ figure 1 ] . 
 after the pre - injury model had been created , the specimen was mounted through its pots on a ferric base .

 the differences in rom within the same group were evaluated with paired t - tests . 
 the rom results for l2l4 in all directions for the mps and pps groups are summarized in table 1 . 
 the addition of an intermediate screw decreased the rom of the l2l4 segments in both the mps and pps groups . 
 a smaller rom due to the use of an intermediate screw represents enhanced stability of the construct , in contrast to a larger rom that was observed in the standard short - segment construct . 
 compared to the short - segment transpedicular fixation group , the addition of intermediate screws provided a smaller rom in flexion , extension , lateral bending , and torsion in the mps group ( p = 0.001 , 0.006 , 0.077 , and 0.000 , respectively ) , and in flexion , extension , lateral bending , and torsion in the pps group ( p = 0.000 , 0.000 , 0.017 , 0.000 , respectively ) . 
 there was neither a difference in the rom in the spines of the two groups before injury , nor a difference in rom between the mpsi and ppsi groups ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 however , when using the intermediate screw in injured spines , the stiffness in the mpsi and ppsi groups increased significantly as compared with the intact spine ( p < 0.05 ) .

 management options for unstable burst fractures include anterior , posterior , or combined ( circumferential ) fixation . 
 many surgeons believe that anterior column reconstruction is critical in correcting kyphotic deformity and reestablishing the anterior load bearing capacity of the vertebral component . short - segment posterior spinal instrumentation using pedicle screws remains the standard method for the fixation of thoracic and lumbar fractures , with acceptable results . 
 the advantages of this technique include less surgical dissection , blood loss , and time in surgery , and as a result , decreased perioperative morbidity . 
 however , loss of reduction and instrumentation failure associated with this technique is well described in the literature.159 these failures have been attributed to poor bone quality , inadequate anterior column support , and insufficient points of fixation . 
 the biomechanical properties of monoaxial pedicle screws have been widely reported.1720 segmental fixation with additional monoaxial pedicle screws at the level of the fracture increases construct stiffness and shields the fractured vertebral body from anterior loads . 
 furthermore , this additional point of fixation allows for a 3-point reduction maneuver , analogous to that used for reduction of long bone fractures . in a recent prospective randomized study , 
 the efficacy of the fracture - level screw combination in achieving and maintaining correction for the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures was evaluated.21 the authors of that study concluded that reinforcement with a fracture - level screw could help provide and maintain improved kyphosis correction . 
 another mid - term clinical study demonstrated superior results with the fracture - level screw combination , supporting the evidence of other reports.22 interestingly , in most of these studies , the pedicle screws used were monoaxial , despite the current trend toward using polyaxial screws in short - segment fracture fixation.101221 on review of the literature , we found that there was a paucity of data , both clinical and biomechanical , on the use of polyaxial screw as an intermediate in unstable burst fractures , and thus this biomechanical study was instituted . 
 the current study showed that when short - segment constructs contained intermediate screws , flexion , extension , and torsion decreased in both the mpsi and ppsi groups , compared to the respective constructs ( mps and pps ) without this reinforcement . 
 the short - segment construct in the pps group had significantly greater rom in flexion and extension when compared with the mps group . 
 the addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stiffness of the short - segment pedicle fixation , irrespective of whether monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws were used . 
 however , this increase was more significant for the mpsi construct , as the ppsi already had significantly increased stiffness as compared to the mpsi . these results may be because there is a better coupling between the polyaxial screw heads and the connecting rod . 
 thus , there is less torsion at the coupling site and consequently less stress on the entire construct . 
 the intermediate screw provides a 3-point fixation of the fractured segment . when using monoaxial screws , the addition of an intermediate forces the surgeon to bend the connecting rod to accommodate the additional screw . 
 polyaxial screws , on the other hand , facilitate the installation of the connecting rod , and their biomechanical properties have been reported in several studies.141623 stanford et al.15 suggested that the rod 
 screw link design of the polyaxial screw reduces its static compressive bending yield strength as compared with the fixed screw designs . 
 liu et al.24 pointed out that there were significant differences between the monoaxial screws and polyaxial screws in the bending stiffness , yield load , yield torque , and torsional stiffness in static tests ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 shepard et al.16 suggested that polyaxial screws do not significantly decrease the stiffness of the construct . on the contrary , 
 the polyaxial constructs create more security by permitting better contact and holding strength between the screw head and the rod . 
 when there is the combined effect of bending loads and shear force on the rods , there would be higher resistance to rotational slippage between the rod and the screw head . the limitations of study are that the data were pertinent to results immediately after surgery , but do not take into account early bone resorption or the cyclical loading effect which have long - term impacts on outcome . 
 the flexibility of the construct was tested on a burst fracture model that was created in a controlled and reproducible manner by the pre - injury and dropped - mass technique . nevertheless , the pattern and nature of a spinal burst fracture in clinic is more variable and unpredictable . 
 anekstein et al.12 hypothesized that the true mechanical effect of the intermediate screws is less predictable in in vivo settings . 
 only a prospective clinical study can show the true practical significance of the addition of intermediate screws . 
 although not human , calf spine has been used before as a valid biomechanical model.2527 calf is a tetrapod ; its anatomical characteristics and common fracture site are different from those of the human , and because the calf lumbar spines ( l1l5 ) can be easily dissected from the other vertebrae of calf , we chose the l1l5 calf lumbar spines and made the l3 vertebral fracture instead of the t12 or l1 which are the most common fracture sites in humans . 
 calf spine segments are presumed to have higher bone mineral density than human spines , and therefore have different biomechanical behavior . 
 nevertheless , the use of an animal model allows for smaller inter - specimen differences , as the human spine has been shown to have significant variability in bone mineral density that might potentially affect the test results.2829 as this study is comparative , the authors favored the animal model to that of the human cadaver spine . 
 it can be argued that the number of cases in each group was less in the present study to reach a meaningful conclusion . 
 however , in the previous biomechanical studies,183031 the number of the cases used in the experiment was usually six or seven . in the present study 
 , we used 12 cases and 6 cases in each group and we believe that these numbers have brought forward meaningful results . 
 another disadvantage of this study is that there was no comparison with long - segment fixations and application of the cross link , which have been shown to have better biomechanical stability than the short segment in managing unstable burst fractures . in conclusion 
 , the addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increases the stability of a short - segment pedicle fixation , using either monoaxial or polyaxial pedicle screws . 
 however , the short - segment mps fixation group was significantly more stable in flexion and extension than the short - segment pps fixation group . 
 we believe that this study provides a biomechanical rationale for using an intermediate screw at the level of fractured vertebrae with posterior short - segment fixation , especially when using monoaxial screws for fixing the unstable burst fractures of the lumbar region .","background : use of a pedicle screw at the level of fracture , also known as an intermediate screw , has been shown to improve clinical results in managing lumbar fracture , but there is a paucity of biomechanical studies to support the claim . 
 the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding intermediate pedicle screws at the level of a fracture on the stiffness of a short - segment pedicle fixation using monoaxial or polyaxial screws and to compare the strength of monoaxial and polyaxial screws in the calf spine fracture model.materials and methods : flexibility of 12 fresh - frozen calf lumbar spine specimens was evaluated in all planes . 
 an unstable burst fracture model was created at the level of l3 by the pre - injury and dropped - mass technique . 
 the specimens were randomly divided into monoaxial pedicle screw ( mps ) and polyaxial pedicle screw ( pps ) groups . 
 flexibility was retested without and with intermediate screws ( mpsi and ppsi ) placed at the level of fracture in addition to standard screws placed at l2 and l4.results:the addition of intermediate screws significantly increased the stability of the constructs , as measured by a decreased range of motion ( rom ) in flexion , extension , and lateral bending in both mps and pps groups ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 there was neither any significant difference in the rom in the spines of the two groups before injury , nor a difference in the rom between the mpsi and ppsi groups ( p > 0.05 ) , but there was a significant difference between mps and pps in flexion and extension in the short - segment fixation group ( p < 0.05).conclusions : the addition of intermediate screws at the level of a burst fracture significantly increased the stability of short - segment pedicle screw fixation in both the mps and pps groups . 
 however , in short - segment fixation group , monoaxial pedicle screw exhibited more stability in flexion and extension than the polyaxial pedicle screw .",pubmed
"interindividual variations of ex vivo platelet aggregation during clopidogrel therapy have been correlated to reduced exposure of active clopidogrel thiol metabolite and differences in p2y12 receptor occupancy.1 high on - treatment platelet reactivity during therapy with clopidogrel and low platelet inhibition are associated with risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting  in particular , stent thrombosis.15 as compared with extensive metabolizers , carriers of cytochrome p450 2c19 ( cyp2c19 ) nonfunctional alleles have been shown to have reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and are at increased risk of adverse events and stent thrombosis after coronary.59 recent advances in the understanding of clopidogrel metabolism suggest that the inactive prodrug undergoes two steps of bioactivation . 
 first , clopidogrel undergoes oxidation to 2-oxo - clopidogrel by hepatic cyp450 enzymes ( 1a2 , 2b6 , 2c9 , 2c19 , and 3a4/5 isoenzymes ) . 
 then , in the second step of the biotransformation , thiol metabolite is generated.10 a recent study employing sophisticated metabolomic methods suggested a hydrolytic process involving paraoxonase-1 ( pon1 ) as the rate - limiting enzyme.10 a common polymorphism of pon1 ( q192r ) is associated with reduced paraoxonase activity in carriers of the qq ( aa ) haplotype . in two cohorts of patients with coronary stenting , and using a case study design , the investigators found the pon1 ( qq192 ) genotype was associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis.10 a group of patients with a history of prior stent thrombosis but who were not receiving current therapy with clopidogrel were administered a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose . within this group , reduced plasma activity of pon1 and pon1 ( qq192 ) genotype were associated with reduced active thiol metabolite exposure and reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.10 only one genome - wide association study ( gwas ) has been performed examining the association of common genetic polymorphisms on platelet inhibition.11 this gwas examined platelet aggregation data from 429 generally healthy white subjects of amish descent after administration of a clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose , followed by maintenance clopidogrel dosing of 75 mg daily for 6 days . 
 platelet aggregation was assessed before administration of clopidogrel and again after 6 days of maintenance dosing . 
 the results from the gwas only found single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) on chromosome 10q24 in linkage equilibrium with the cyp2c19 * 2 loss - of - function variant to be significantly associated with clopidogrel platelet inhibition.11 the gwas did not find evidence of a significant association of snps located on or near the pon1 gene on chromosome 7 with variation in platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.11 the aim of the current study was to assess the impact of pon1 ( q192r ) and cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphisms on clopidogrel platelet inhibition , as measured by light transmittance aggregometry and verifynow ( vn ) p2y12 assay , in a north american study population of mixed racial background .

 genotypes for cyp2c19 and pon1 were identified and included in univariate and multivariate linear regression , along with clinical variables that are known to affect platelet reactivity and response to clopidogrel and variables with p < 0.1 in univariate analysis ( table 2 ) . 
 baseline characteristics of the study subjects are described according to cyp2c19 * 2 and pon1 q192r genotypes in table 1 . 
 overall clinical variables were well balanced among genotype groups . a total of 96 subjects on maintenance clopidogrel therapy for over 14 days and 55 subjects who received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose at the time of pci were enrolled . 
 the prevalence of african - americans was significantly different across pon1 q192r genotypes , with a higher prevalence of african - americans in carriers of pon1 qq192 ( table 1 ) . 
 these findings are consistent with the increased prevalence of qq192 genotypes previously described in the african population as compared with populations of european descent.15 among the 151 patients included in this study , 63 ( 42% ) were carriers of the qq192 genotype , 67 ( 44% ) were heterozygous allele carriers ( qr192 ) , and 21 patients ( 14% ) were homozygous rr192 genotype carriers . 
 for the cyp2c19 * 2 allele , 107 ( 71% ) were wild - type homozygous for the * 2 allelic variant ( * 1/*1 ) , 39 ( 26% ) were heterozygous * 2 allele carriers ( * 1/*2 ) , and five patients ( 3% ) were homozygous * 2 allele carriers ( * 2/*2 ) . 
 for both genotype distributions , no significant deviations from the hardy weinberg equilibrium were observed ( p = 0.64 for pon1 q192r ; p = 0.54 for cyp2c19 * 2 genotypes ) . 
 there were no cyp2c19 * 3 alleles detected in the study population , which is consistent with the very rare frequency ( < 1% ) of this loss - of - function allele in caucasians and african- americans . 
 platelet aggregation induced by adp demonstrated wide interindividual variability during therapy with clopidogrel , as previously documented ( table 2 , figures 14).15 pon1 qq192 was not associated with increased platelet aggregation induced by adp at various concentrations during clopidogrel therapy before and after adjustment for 2c19 * 2 , diabetes mellitus , obesity , smoking , and proton pump inhibitor therapy ( table 2 ) . 
 pon1 qq192 was also not associated with increased vn - p2y12 reactivity ; in fact , there was a trend towards lower platelet reactivity in pon1 qq192 individuals . 
 no significant difference in the percentage of platelet inhibition measured by vn was documented among individuals of varying pon1 genotype ( table 2 , figure 2 ) . 
 carriers of 2c19 * 2 alleles had higher platelet aggregation and higher vn - p2y12 reactivity with significantly lower vn platelet inhibition than noncarriers ( table 2 , figure 1 ) . among the subgroup of patients who received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose prior to undergoing pci , platelet aggregation measured before and after administration of clopidogrel was not significantly different between subjects of pon1 qq192 and qr192/rr192 genotypes ( figure 3 ) . 
 there was no significant difference in platelet inhibition among homozygous carriers of reduced - function pon1 ( qq192 ) and qr192 and rr192 genotypes at 4 and 1624 hours after administration of a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose ( figure 3 ) . 
 in the same subgroup of patients who had received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose and who had a baseline platelet aggregation measurement , 2c19 * 2 carriers status was associated with significantly lower percentage of platelet inhibition measured by adp 10 
 mol / l , without reaching statistical significance for other concentrations of adp ( figure 4 ) . in the univariate linear regression analysis , only 2c19 * 2 carrier status ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.034 ) , current smoking ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.025 ) , and weight ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.018 ) were significantly associated with adp - induced platelet aggregation . 
 pon1 q192r homozygous reduced - function genotype ( qq192 ) ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.7 ) , diabetes ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.22 ) , and proton pump inhibitor use ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.65 ) were not significantly associated with adp - induced platelet aggregation ( table 2 ) . 
 covariates with p < 0.1 were included in a multivariate regression analysis , as well as variables such as diabetes and proton pump inhibitor use that have previously been established as affecting clopidogrel platelet inhibition . in a multivariate linear regression analysis that included diabetes , smoking , obesity , and proton pump inhibitor use as variables in addition to pon1 q192r and cyp2c19 * 2 genotypes , cyp2c19 * 2 carrier status ( adp 10 mol / l ; p = 0.036 ) , but not pon1 q192r ( adp 10 
 mol / l ; p = 0.89 ) , were associated with significant differences in adp - induced platelet aggregation ( table 2 ) . 
 clopidogrel is transformed into 2-oxo - clopidogrel by cyp450 enzymes and , in a second step , into the active thiol metabolite . 
 10 a recent metabolomic study suggested that pon1 , a serum esterase , may represent the rate - limiting enzyme by hydrolysis of 2-oxo - clopidogrel into thiol clopidogrel . 
 common snps of pon1 have been suggested to affect enzymatic activity of the enzyme . in bouman 
 et als10 study , pon1 activity was significantly reduced in subjects homozygous for the wild - type allele ( pon1 qq192 ) compared with carriers of the mutant allele . 
 in addition , in a group of patients with stent thrombosis and matched controls without stent thrombosis , pon1 qq192 was associated with decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and decreased plasma exposure to active thiol metabolite after a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose . 
 also , pon1 qq192 genotype was associated with an odds ratio of 3.3 for the occurrence of stent thrombosis as compared with qr192 or rr192 genotypes.10 the only gwas on clopidogrel response had previously not found an association with snps located on or near the pon1 gene , but the platelet assays in that study were performed after 7 days of therapy with clopidogrel.11 the patients included in the gwas were generally healthy white subjects , who had received a clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily for 6 days prior to analysis of platelet aggregation.11 similar to findings from other investigators since the publication of the study by bouman et al,10 the current study could not document an association of pon1 ( q192r ) genotype with platelet inhibition by clopidogrel in patients of mixed racial background with established coronary artery disease during treatment with clopidogrel.1621 neither platelet inhibition measured by vn - p2y12 assay nor on - treatment platelet aggregation using various doses of adp showed significant differences among genotypes of pon1 q192r . among the group of patients who received a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose immediately before pci , platelet studies performed before and after administration of 600 mg of clopidogrel showed no significant differences in platelet aggregation among genotypes of pon1 q192r ( figure 3 ) . 
 the results of the current study are consistent with findings of shuldiner et al,11 who did not demonstrate an association of snps in or near the pon1 gene with clopidogrel nonresponse during clopidogrel maintenance dosing , and they confirm the association of 2c19 * 2 polymorphism with reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.22,23 in the current study , cyp2c19 * 2 carrier status was associated with reduced platelet inhibition , as measured by vn - p2y12 assay and lta 10 mol / l , and increased on - treatment platelet reactivity , as measured by both lta and vn - p2y12 assay ( table 2 , figures 1 and 4 ) . 
 cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphism has been demonstrated to be a strong determinant of reduced active clopidogrel metabolite formation , increased on - treatment adp - induced platelet reactivity , and clinical ischemic events after coronary stenting.59,11,22,23 in a meta - analysis investigating the effect of reduced - function 2c19 alleles on recurrent ischemic events in patients receiving clopidogrel after coronary stenting , the presence of one reduced - function allele was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.67 and the presence of two reduced - function alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.97 for the occurrence of stent thrombosis . 
 these findings support the clinical importance of the reduced - function cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphism and clopidogrel nonresponse after coronary stenting.9 although not supported by the findings of this study , that pon1 q192r polymorphisms could affect the generation of active thiol metabolite with administration of 600 mg or greater loading doses ( as suggested by the findings of bouman et al)10 and that it could be associated with small differences in platelet inhibition can not be excluded.10 however , in contrast to bouman et als10 study , several investigators were unable to confirm the association between pon1 q192r genotypes and stent thrombosis in other independent large cohorts of patients undergoing pci who were treated with clopidogrel.1621 limitations of the study include a relatively small sample size and a lack of pharmacokinetic analysis to detect differences in active metabolite concentrations . 
 although considered the gold standard for measuring platelet aggregation and clopidogrel platelet inhibition , lta is subject to operator variability , and on - treatment platelet aggregation may not be a direct reflection of p2y12 receptor inhibition by active clopidogrel metabolites . 
 this study confirms the previously reported impact of reduced - function cyp2c19 * 2 polymorphism on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel . 
 polymorphisms of pon1 q192r appear not to be predictive of clopidogrel response when measured by lta and vn - p2y12 assay in patients with coronary artery disease .","backgroundthe metabolic activation of clopidogrel is a two - step process . 
 it has been suggested that paraoxonase-1 ( pon1 ) is a rate - limiting enzyme in the conversion of 2-oxo- clopidogrel to an active thiol metabolite . 
 conflicting results have been reported in regard to ( 1 ) the association of a common polymorphism of pon1 ( q192r ) with reduced rates of coronary stent thrombosis in patients taking clopidogrel and ( 2 ) its effects on platelet inhibition in patient populations of european descent.methodsblood samples from 151 subjects of mixed racial background with established coronary artery disease and who received clopidogrel were analyzed . 
 platelet aggregation was determined with light transmittance aggregometry and verifynow p2y12 assay . 
 genotyping for cytochrome p450 2c19 ( cyp2c19)*2 and * 3 and pon1 ( q192r ) polymorphisms was performed.resultscarriers of cyp2c19 * 2 alleles exhibited lower levels of platelet inhibition and higher on - treatment platelet aggregation than noncarriers . 
 there was no significant difference in platelet aggregation among pon1 q192r genotypes . 
 homozygous carriers of the wild - type variant of pon1 ( qq192 ) had similar on - treatment platelet reactivity to carriers of increased - function variant alleles during maintenance clopidogrel dosing , as well as after administration of a clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose.conclusioncyp2c19*2 allele is associated with impaired platelet inhibition by clopidogrel and high on - treatment platelet aggregation . 
 pon1 ( q192r ) polymorphism does not appear to be a significant determinant of clopidogrel response .",pubmed
"this is a retrospective , observational , consecutive case series conducted in a tertiary eye care hospital in north india . 
 all patients with history of fireworks - related injuries , who attended the emergency eye care services and outpatient services during the 5 days of the diwali festival  2 days before diwali , day of diwali , and 2 days after diwali  for 5 consecutive years from 2011 to 2015 , were included in this study . 
 all relevant data related to age , sex , laterality , type of firework , whether user or bystander , baseline visual acuity ( va ) , details of injuries , diagnosis , whether requiring surgical or conservative management , and final best - corrected va ( bcva ) at the last follow - up were recorded . 
 patients with lid tears , corneal tears , scleral tears , and intraocular foreign body ( iofb ) were admitted and were given immediate medical and surgical attention , while those with nonpenetrating injuries were treated on an outpatient basis . 
 the immediate management of ocular burns comprised thorough eye wash with normal saline , removal of dust , soot particles and debris , and finally ruling out open - globe injury . 
 depending on the severity of ocular injury , patients were started on copious lubricants , topical antibiotics , and steroid combination eye drops and cycloplegics . 
 a total of 53 eyes of 45 patients were seen during the 5 consecutive days of diwali festival from 2011 to 2015 . 
 the right eye was affected in 30 eyes , while in 23 , the left eye was affected . 
 the characteristics of injury at presentation are summarized in table 1 . among the patients who could recall the type of the firecracker causing injury , 
 the severity of ocular damage was more among the patients who ignited the fireworks themselves than the bystanders [ table 1 ] . 
 five eyes ( 9.43% ) had an open - globe injury while 48 ( 90.56% ) had closed - globe injury . 
 six patients had undergone primary treatment elsewhere and were referred to our hospital for further management . 
 one patient with corneal epithelial defect required amniotic membrane transplant and glue with bandage contact lens . 
 eighteen ( 33.96% ) eyes underwent surgical management at our institute , 34 ( 64.15% ) eyes were managed conservatively , and only 1 ( 1.88% ) eye was advised primary enucleation . 
 age distribution of patients presenting with fireworks - related ocular injuries characteristics of ocular injury out of the 18 surgically managed eyes , three eyes underwent corneal tear repair , one eye underwent scleral tear repair , cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation , and lensectomy in one eye each . 
 pars plana vitrectomy for the management of vitreous hemorrhage , retinal detachment , and iofb removal was done in 5 , 2 , and 1 eyes , respectively . 
 twenty - two eyes had bcva of 6/6 at final follow - up , 11 eyes had between 6/60 and 6/9 , < 6/60 to perception of light ( pl+ ) in 7 eyes , and no pl in 1 eye [ table 2 ] . 
 five eyes eventually developed phthisis bulbi , of which three eyes underwent secondary enucleation with ball implant and ocular prosthesis .

 three patients ( 6 eyes ) were lost to follow - up . visual outcome following ocular firecracker injury 
 diwali or deepawali  is described as a festival to celebrate lord rama 's return from exile . 
 this 5-day festival is also called the  festival of lights ,  where people light their homes with 
 this gesture brings out a feeling of joy and happiness and an expression of gratitude to the lord . 
 the firecracker industry gives livelihood to over 0.3 million people directly and indirect employment to about 1 million people . 
 sound and dust pollution and firework - related burn injuries are the most common problems related to the use of firecrackers . horrifying industrial accidents arising from the manufacture of fireworks have also been reported . 
 our study was a hospital - based , single - center , retrospective case series of firecracker injuries documented over a 5-day long period during diwali over the past 5 years . 
 our hospital is a tertiary eye care hospital located in the central district of the state of new delhi . 
 we cater our services to a large population of northern and central india including the adjoining states of haryana , rajasthan , uttar pradesh , and punjab . in our study , the age range was 353 years with mean age of 20.55 years . among the 45 patients , the majority ( 39 ) were males , consistent with findings from previous studies , probably reflecting the males to be more adventurous and aggressive . 
 a similar study was conducted in a multispecialty hospital located in the vellore district , tamil nadu , by john et al . , which included patients < 18 years during the 3 days of diwali over the past 5 years . 
 eighty - four children presented with firework - related ocular injuries during the study period , of which 44% required hospitalization . the prevalence of unilateral blindness in children due to fireworks was 8% . in our study , 53 eyes of 45 patients presented with firework - related eye injuries . 
 we included patients of all age groups and all cases who presented to our hospital during the 5 days of diwali in the past 5 years . 
 the possible reasons for the lesser incidence of firework - related injuries in our study were as follows : ( 1 ) our hospital is a tertiary eye care center where only cases related to eye pathologies are referred . 
 ( 2 ) our hospital is surrounded by muslim - dominated population who do not celebrate the hindu festival of diwali . 
 ( 3 ) the urban location of our hospital may be one of the reasons for the fewer cases being reported . 
 there are multiple tertiary referral centers in the city that are capable of managing ocular trauma - related cases . 
 ( 4 ) more firecracker manufacturing industries are located in south india ; increased risk of fireworks - related trauma . 
 ( 5 ) better awareness regarding safety and legislation related to fireworks among the urban population . in our study , only one eye ( 1.88% ) with ocular injuries did not have even pl while seven eyes ( 13.2% ) had vision worse than 3/60 . 
 five eyes had phthisis bulbi  three eyes following irreparable retinal detachment , one eye following severe ocular hypotony , and one eye following a failed retinal detachment surgery . 
 , three children ( 5.1% ) with ocular injuries did not have even pl while 10 ( 11.9% ) children had vision worse than 3/60 in the injured eye . 
 this clearly demonstrates the extent of ocular morbidity and visual loss due to firecracker injuries . in our study , 
 serious ocular injuries occur due to the sudden appearance of unpredictable firecrackers before a person can deploy any defense mechanism . 
 the most common types of firecracker causing injury were bombs as reported by other indian studies . 
 high - velocity fireworks such as rockets and bombs are more frequently associated with facial lacerations , iofb , endophthalmitis , and subsequently , poorer visual outcome . 
 a study from china documenting fireworks - related injuries during the spring festival have reported a higher preponderance of open - globe injuries . in our study , 
 corneal abrasions , corneal foreign body , and hyphema were the most common findings involving the anterior segment , while the most common posterior segment finding was vitreous hemorrhage . 
 unfortunately , fireworks - related ocular trauma can be vision - threatening and can cause permanent facial disfigurement . 
 the central pollution control board estimates that 95% of firecrackers violate noise and pollution norms . in india , the manufacture , sale , and use of firecrackers generating noise levels exceeding 125 db or 
 the supreme court has banned setting off firecrackers between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. during festival seasons . however , in india , laws regarding displays and celebrations involving firecrackers and those regulating bursting of firecrackers by individual members of the public are virtually absent . 
 deregulating the sale of fireworks can cause increased burden of firework related morbidity as seen in studies from northern ireland and south africa . 
 chan et al . reported tripling of ocular injuries after the removal of a ban on fireworks in 1996 in ireland . 
 kuhn et al . showed a reduced incidence of firework related injuries , following the strict enforcement of fireworks ban at private places . 
 the limitation of our study was the retrospective method of capturing data and inclusion of cases that got injured only during the 5 days around diwali . 
 this would have resulted in missing out additional cases of firework - related eye trauma and underestimating the actual magnitude of this vision - threatening problem . 
 a significant percentage of patients end up losing their vision due to firework - related eye injuries . 
 immediate measures such as prohibiting the manufacture and sale of dangerous fireworks such as rockets and those which produce loud noise are required in the reducing significant ocular morbidity and noise pollution . 
 public awareness about the possible dangers , prophylactic measures , and expert primary ophthalmic care of the injured are the most realistic options available at present . 
 firework displays at public places by professionals should be encouraged during diwali and other major celebrations . 
 firework - related eye injuries are an important cause of preventable blindness , especially in the younger economically productive population . 
 ocular trauma from firecrackers when serious can lead to blindness , facial burns , and permanent disfigurement . in a country like india , 
 festivals have their own social , cultural , and economic significance . with the concept of cracker - free festival not working , 
 a combined approach of creating public awareness and strong legislation is required to regulate the manufacture , sale , and use of consumer fireworks to reduce this preventable cause of ocular morbidity . 
  
 ","purpose : to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of ocular injuries resulting from the use of firecrackers during the diwali festival in all age groups.materials and methods : a single - center , retrospective , hospital - based case series presenting with ocular trauma consequent to fireworks usage in a tertiary eye care center in north india during the 5 days of diwali festival from 2011 to 2015 was conducted.results:a total of 53 eyes of 45 patients were included in the study , out of which the vast majority ( 39/87% ) were males . 
 the mean age was 20.55 years . 
 almost an equal number of bystanders ( 25/55.5% ) were affected as compared to people handling the fireworks ( 20/44.44% ) . 
 five ( 9.43% ) eyes had open - globe injury , whereas 48 ( 90.56% ) eyes had closed - globe injury . 
 eighteen ( 33.96% ) eyes underwent surgical intervention . 
 thirty - three ( 62.26% ) eyes had final vision > 20/200 with eight ( 15.09% ) eyes being vision < 3/60 in the affected eye.conclusion:firework-related ocular trauma can lead to serious visual impairment . 
 mandatory legislative laws pertaining to the manufacture , sale , and use of fireworks and creating public awareness can reduce the incidence of this preventable cause of blindness in the society . initiating new policies for retailers involved in sale of these firecrackers can also bring in decrease of such morbidities .",pubmed
"subclinical hypothyroidism ( sch ) , which is defined as an isolated elevation of thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) levels with a normal free thyroxine ( ft4 ) level , is a relatively common disorder . 
 most experts agree that sch represents early , mild thyroid failure   and this issue is becoming increasingly recognized because the performance of thyroid function tests have substantially increased in primary care settings . despite the intuitive appeal of the relationship between elevated tsh levels or sch and adverse cardiovascular ( cv ) outcomes , 
 it remains unclear whether variations in thyroid hormone levels within the normal range are also associated with mortality endpoints . 
 the precise definition and clinical significance of sch are also confounded by controversies regarding the correct upper limit of the reference range for serum tsh . 
 in fact , the optimal tsh cutoff values and clinical significance of these subclinical abnormalities are even more controversial . 
 typically , the treatment of sch is considered only for patients who are pregnant , infertile , exhibit associated symptoms , or have a high risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism . 
 although there is a high prevalence of sch , the evidence supporting screening for this disorder and the benefits and risks of its treatment remain controversial . therefore , the primary goals of the present narrative review were to assess current evidence regarding the clinical aspects of sch and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) and to evaluate the mechanisms that are likely to underlie this relationship . to accomplish these goals , an updated search of pubmed was conducted for the most recent articles investigating the risks and treatment of sch that were published prior to 2015 . 
 sch has various causes of which the most common ( 60% to 80% ) is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis associated with the presence of anti - thyroid peroxidase antibodies , which is a marker of chronic lymphocytic ( hashimoto 's ) thyroiditis . 
 hashimoto 's thyroiditis is more common in girls and women , but the overall incidence increases with age in both sexes . 
 patients who have been treated for overt thyroid failure often exhibit sch due to inadequate thyroid hormone supplementation , poor adherence to the treatment regimen , drug interactions , or the inadequate monitoring of treatment . 
 the prevalence of sch varies according to population , age , sex , race , region , and method of tsh measurement . 
 thus , it is necessary that the normal reference range for tsh levels be standardized and that appropriate quality control procedures be established by each laboratory investigating this phenomenon . in general , 
 sch is defined as a tsh level greater than 4.0 to 6.0 miu / l . 
 the prevalence of sch is relatively high and ranges from 4% to 20% in the adult population with women , elderly people , and iodine - sufficient populations being affected more often . 
 for example , in a recent study using korean population - based cohorts , the prevalence of sch was reported to be 11.3% . 
 the adverse clinical effects associated with overt thyroid disorders are well known and , given the multiple actions of thyroid hormones on the heart , vessels , bones , and brain , long - term adverse outcomes may manifest as subclinical levels of dysfunction . 
 table 1 provides an overview of the findings from studies investigating the associations of sch with various clinical conditions . 
 for example , the relationship between pathological thyroid dysfunction and body weight is well established . 
 cross - sectional studies using population cohorts have demonstrated that variations in thyroid function within the population reference range have a substantial impact on weight and body mass index ( bmi ) . 
 higher levels of tsh are associated with an increased bmi   and rising tsh levels which , in turn , are associated with enhanced weight gain . 
 additionally , an increasing amount of evidence indicates that higher levels of tsh are associated with worsening blood pressure ( bp ) and altered lipid levels . 
 a cross - sectional study demonstrated that subjects with sch exhibit increased bp   and a population - based study observed positive linear associations between tsh levels and systolic and diastolic bp . 
 similarly , a recent meta - analysis found that sch is associated with higher systolic bp . 
 thyroid hormones exert multiple effects on the regulation , absorption , and metabolism of lipid synthesis as well . 
 previous studies have consistently demonstrated that elevated levels of serum total cholesterol ( tc ) , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) , apolipoprotein b , lipoprotein(a ) , and possibly triglycerides ( tg ) are reversed in individuals with overt hypothyroidism following levothyroxine ( t4 ) therapy . 
 a number of studies have reported significant increases in serum tc , ldl - c , and tg in patients with sch   and the findings of a meta - analysis found that the tc , ldl - c , and tg levels of sch subjects are significantly increased relative to euthyroid individuals . 
 similarly , a korean study demonstrated that sch subjects with an intermediate - to - high risk of cvd had higher coronary calcium scores than euthyroid subjects   and marfella et al . 
 identified enhanced inflammatory activity in the asymptomatic carotid plaques of sch subjects compared to euthyroid subjects . 
 sch can also lead to vascular problems characterized by increased vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction . 
 studies of euthyroid individuals have shown that ft4 and triiodothyronine ( t3 ) levels , even within the normal range , are inversely associated with the presence and severity of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis as well as carotid artery intima media thickness . 
 other possible explanations for the increased cv risk in persons with sch include hypercoagulability , insulin resistance , oxidative stress , and endothelial dysfunction . 
 metabolic syndrome ( mets ) is a condition characterized by a cluster of metabolic disorders including abdominal obesity , insulin resistance / glucose intolerance , dyslipidemia , and hypertension . 
 it has been well documented that mets is associated with increased risks of all - cause mortality and cvd . a systemic review by iwen et al 
 .   found convincing evidence supporting the major impact of sch on all components of mets and a cross - sectional analysis of cohort studies highlighted the fact that the odds of having mets are positively associated with tsh levels within the reference range . additionally , cross - sectional and longitudinal follow - up studies from japan observed strong associations between sch and mets . 
 in korea , high normal tsh levels were significantly associated with the increased prevalence of mets in 7,270 euthyroid men and women   and another study of 2,760 young korean female volunteers with normal tsh levels found that the high tsh group had a 2-fold greater risk of mets than subjects in the low tsh group . 
 it is well known that thyroid hormones act on the heart and vasculature and , as a result , the impact of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on the cv system has recently become an important topic of research . 
 sch can lead to impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function   and symptomatic sch patients often complain of reduced exercise tolerance during effort . 
 this same study found that a slowed rate of left ventricular relaxation might critically impair ventricular filling during exercise and result in left ventricular systolic dysfunction . 
 older people with sch and a high cv risk appear to be at an increased risk of incident heart failure   and sch was found to affect left ventricular dysfunction , although this abnormality may be reversed by t4 substitutive therapy . 
 likewise , a recent cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopic study demonstrated that early cardiac bio - energetic impairments in sch patients are reversible with t4 therapy . 
 a pooled analysis from six prospective cohorts also found that the risk of heart failure events increases in conjunction with higher tsh levels . 
 studies of euthyroid individuals observed a positive association between tsh levels and mortality due to coronary heart disease ( chd ) . 
 tsh levels within the normal range are inversely associated with all - cause mortality   and adult taiwanese subjects with sch were shown to have an increased risk for all - cause mortality and cvd death over a 10-year period . however 
 , other studies did not find any associations with all - cause   or cv   mortality rates . 
 these discrepant findings may be due to differences in sample size and power , the inconsistent age and sex ratios of the study populations , or the varied iodine intakes of different regions . 
 two meta - analyses   investigating this matter demonstrated that sch may be associated with a modest increase in the risks of chd and mortality , particularly in subjects with higher tsh levels . a more recent review of the clinical consequences of variations in thyroid function within the normal reference range found that even modest elevations of tsh may have substantial health outcomes , including cv mortality . in a korean cohort that was followed for 10 years , elevated serum tsh levels significantly increased the risk of cvd by approximately 20% per one standard deviation in males . 
 more recently , ft4 and ft3 levels within the normal range were inversely associated with the risks of all - cause and cancer mortality in a korean cohort of euthyroid men and women ( n=212,456 ) . 
 a number of placebo - controlled studies have assessed the effects of t4 replacement therapy on the symptoms of patients with sch . however , the reported benefits of various sch treatments are limited and evidence regarding the association of sch with cvd remains controversial . 
 an intervention study of 56 women with sch identified elevated systolic and diastolic bp and increased serum cholesterol and homocysteine levels compared to healthy controls ; these factors were normalized after 18 months of t4 therapy . 
 a systematic review of 13 heterogeneous studies concluded that t4 treatment leads to a reduction in serum tc and ldl - c levels in patients with sch ; this finding has been confirmed in subsequent randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) . 
 however , to date , clinical trials have not consistently shown the beneficial effects of t4 treatment on serum lipid levels in sch patients . 
 nonetheless , reductions in carotid intima - media thickness   and improvements in brachial artery endothelial function have been observed in individuals with sch following t4 replacement . 
 thus , the negative effects of sch on cv function might be improved or reversed by replacement doses of t4 . 
 although only a few studies investigating the cv effects of t4 have been double - blinded and placebo - controlled , these trials concur that t4 replacement therapy improves systolic and diastolic heart function , endothelial function , and carotid intima - media thickness . 
 similarly , in a small rct , the normalization of tsh levels following t4 replacement therapy led to an improvement in cardiac function . moreover , there are new data supporting improved outcomes in younger ( < 70 years ) chd patients treated with t4 . on the other hand , a cochrane review from 2007 assessed 12 rcts of t4 replacement in patients with sch and concluded that replacement therapy for sch did not result in improved survival or decreased cv morbidity . 
 the indications for the screening of sch and the determination of tsh threshold levels for the treatment of sch have remained a clinical controversy for over many years . 
 additional observational data are unlikely to adequately address the uncertainties associated with the risks of sch or the potential benefits and risks of replacement therapy 
 . these concerns will be best addressed in an appropriately powered rct that assesses clinical outcomes . 
 the european commission has now funded such a trial ; the thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism ( trust ) study . 
 the trust study is a multicenter , double - blinded , placebo - controlled randomized trial designed to assess the multimodal effects of thyroid hormone replacement in 3,000 adults 65 years of age and older with persistent sch ( clinicaltrials.gov : nct01660126 ) . 
 in addition to cv events such as chd , stroke , and heart failure , this trial will evaluate disease - specific and health - related quality of life , muscle function , and cognitive function . 
 this study should definitively clarify the populations that may benefit from t4 replacement by assessing multiple clinical outcomes as well as whether these benefits may be offset by the potential adverse effects of replacement therapy , such as atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis . 
 the significance of sch is now widely studied and the data continue to accumulate . in summary , 
 the present review has highlighted the fact that sch is associated with an increased risk of developing a wide range of adverse health outcomes and that sch might represent a potentially modifiable risk factor of cvd and mortality . 
 therefore , understanding the prevalence and risk factors of sch could aid in the prevention of cvd in this population . 
 however , until the results of the trust study are published and current clinical recommendations   are updated , the decision to treat or not treat an sch patient will be based on clinical judgment , clinical practice guidelines , and expert opinion .","subclinical hypothyroidism ( sch ) is a common disorder that is characterized by elevated thyroid - stimulating hormone levels in conjunction with free thyroxine concentrations within the normal reference range . 
 thyroid hormones are known to affect the heart and vasculature and , as a result , the impact of sch on the cardiovascular ( cv ) system has recently become an important topic of research . 
 strong evidence points to a link between sch and cv risk factors such as alterations in blood pressure , lipid levels , and atherosclerosis . 
 additionally , accumulating evidence indicates that sch is associated with metabolic syndrome and heart failure . 
 the present review proposes that sch may be a potentially modifiable risk factor of cv disease and mortality . 
 however , large - scale clinical trials with appropriate power investigating the risks and benefits of sch treatment are required to determine whether these benefits can be achieved with levothyroxine therapy .",pubmed
"the design and principal findings of the dream trial have been presented in previous publications ( 17 ) . 
 briefly , the dream trial was a large , international , multicenter , double - blind , randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in people with ifg or igt , metabolic states that indicate very high risk for eventual progression to diabetes ( 17 ) . 
 eligibility for the dream trial included a diagnosis of ifg , igt , or both ifg and igt based on a screening 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) ( 17 ) . 
 a total of 5,269 participants with these disorders were recruited and randomized to either ramipril and/or rosiglitazone using a two - by - two factorial design and followed for a median of 3 years after randomization . 
 participants were assessed at regular intervals to ascertain the occurrence of the primary outcome , which included new - onset diabetes or all - cause mortality . as part of a substudy 
 , 982 dream trial participants attending canadian study centers had ogtts at baseline , after 2 years , and at the end of the study , with blood samples drawn fasting as well as 30 and 120 min after the glucose challenge . 
 the primary outcome variable in the present study was change in -cell function over the course of follow - up . 
 -cell function was assessed using two measures : the insulinogenic index ( igi ) and proinsulin ( pi ) concentration , with igi defined as ( 30-min insulin  fasting insulin)/(30-min glucose  fasting glucose ) . 
 both indexes have previously been validated against gold - standard measures of insulin secretion ( 18,19 ) and have been shown to be significant predictors of incident diabetes in large epidemiological studies . to account for the compensatory response of insulin secretion in relation to background insulin resistance , 
 igi was divided by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index ( homa - ir ) ( defined as fasting glucose  fasting insulin/22.5 ) ( igi / ir ) for univariate analysis or adjusted for homa - ir in multivariate analysis . 
 similarly , pi concentration was divided by c - peptide concentration ( i.e. , the pi / c - peptide ratio [ pi / c ] ) for univariate analysis or adjusted for insulin secretion using c - peptide as a covariate in multivariate analysis . 
 although the pi - to - insulin ratio is often used to identify disproportionate elevations in pi , c - peptide offers advantages over insulin as a denominator for pi because it is cosecreted with insulin in an equimolar ratio , but unlike insulin it is not extracted by the liver and thus it has a constant peripheral clearance . 
 glucose concentration was determined using an enzymatic reference method on a roche hitachi 917 instrument and a roche reagent kit ( roche diagnostics , indianapolis , in ) . 
 serum insulin and c - peptide were measured on the roche elecsys 2010 immunoassay analyzer using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay . 
 the insulin assay had a sensitivity of 1.39 pmol / l , an interassay coefficient of variation ( cv ) of < 4.6% at all levels , and < 0.05% cross - reactivity with human c - peptide and pi . 
 the c - peptide assay had a sensitivity of 3.0 pmol / l , an interassay cv of < 3% at all levels , and < 0.005% cross - reactivity with human insulin . 
 pi concentration was measured using a sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay manufactured by linco research ( linco research , st . 
 this assay had a sensitivity of 2.0 pmol / l , an interassay cv of < 9% at all levels , and no cross - reactivity with human insulin or des ( 31,32 ) split pi , although this assay does cross - react with human des ( 64,65 ) split pi . 
 statistical analyses were conducted using sas version 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc ) , and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant . 
 the distributions of continuous variables were assessed for normality , and transformations of skewed variables were used in the analysis as appropriate . means and sds for primary -cell function measures ( igi / ir and pi / c ) were calculated for each time point ( baseline , at 2 years , and final visit ) , according to the marginal treatment group . 
 p values for change were based on a t test of the average change being different from zero , while p values for treatment difference were calculated using the wilcoxon 's rank - sum test . 
 similar analyses were conducted within subgroups of isolated ifg ( iifg ) , isolated igt ( iigt ) , and combined ifg and igt ( ifg+igt ) . 
 as there was no significant interaction between ramipril and rosiglitazone 's effect on -cell function , main - effects analyses were conducted according to marginal randomization groups ( i.e. , rosiglitazone versus placebo , ramipril versus placebo ) . 
 longitudinal analyses of the associations between treatments and changes over time in -cell function measures were examined using random - effects models in proc mixed , which provides appropriate options for handling the covariance structure of the repeated - measures ( longitudinal ) data . 
 specifically , we ran four models , which assessed the impact of treatment group on 1 ) igi , with age and homa - ir as covariates ; 2 ) igi / homa - ir , with age as a covariate ; 3 ) pi , with age and c - peptide as covariates ; and 4 ) pi / c , with age as a covariate . 
 finally , using cox proportional hazards regression , we assessed whether the impact of ramipril and/or rosiglitazone treatment on diabetes incidence was independent of baseline levels and changes over the course of the trial in -cell function . 
 the outcome variable in these analyses was diabetes status at the final visit , and the primary exposures were the marginal treatment groups ( rosiglitazone , ramipril ) . in separate models , we assessed the impact of treatment on diabetes incidence , adjusting for either baseline -cell function ( including baseline igi and homa - ir or baseline pi and c - peptide as covariates ) or change over the course of the trial in -cell function ( including changes in the above - mentioned covariates ) . 
 baseline models were also adjusted for age and baseline waist circumference , fasting glucose , triglycerides , and hdl , while change models were also adjusted for age and changes in these covariates .

 baseline models were also adjusted for age and baseline waist circumference , fasting glucose , triglycerides , and hdl , while change models were also adjusted for age and changes in these covariates . 
 the average age and bmi were 54 years and 31.5 kg / m , respectively , and 60% of participants were female . the majority ( 81% ) were of european origin , and substantial proportions had a family history of diabetes or a history of gestational diabetes ( 61 and 16% , respectively ) , characteristics that were consistent with the recruiting strategy for the dream trial ( 17 ) . 
 there were no significant differences between the marginal randomization groups for any of the baseline characteristics other than family history of diabetes in the ramipril versus placebo marginal group ( p = 0.02 ) ( table 1 ) . 
 baseline characteristics of participants with measures of -cell function overall and by allocation data are means  sd or n ( % ) . 
 no significant differences between rosiglitazone versus placebo or ramipril versus placebo other than family history of diabetes in the ramipril versus placebo group ( p = 0.02 ) . 
 changes in markers of -cell function in marginal randomization groups are presented in table 2 . 
 participants receiving rosiglitazone versus placebo had a significant increase in igi / ir during the study ( 25.59 vs. 1.94 , p < 0.0001 ) and a significant decrease in pi / c ( 0.010 vs. 0.006 , p < 0.0001 ) . 
 in contrast , there were no significant changes in igi / ir or pi / c in participants receiving ramipril versus placebo ( 11.71 vs. 18.15 , p > 0.05 , and 0.007 vs. 0.008 , p > 0.05 , respectively ) ( table 2 ) . in the rosiglitazone group , 
 changes in the -cell function measures were more substantial between the baseline and 2-year visits compared with changes that occurred between the 2-year and final visits ( table 2 ) . 
 the impact of rosiglitazone on igi / ir and pi / c was similar within subgroups of iigt and ifg + igt ( iigt , igi / ir : 27.74 vs. 2.76 , p < 0.0001 ; pi / c : 0.009 vs. 0.008 , p < 0.001 ; ifg + igt , igi / ir : 27.39 vs. 0.70 , p < 0.0001 ; pi / c : 0.014 vs. 0.002 , p < 0.0001 ) , although effects were more modest in those with iifg ( igi / ir : 8.95 vs. 2.13 , p = 0.03 ; pi / c : 0.003 vs. 0.001 , p > 0.05 ) ( supplemental table , available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-1579/dc1 ) . 
 changes in markers of -cell function data are means  sd and are reported for marginal treatment groups . 
 p value for change were based on a t test of the average change being different from zero . 
 we further assessed the impact of treatment on markers of -cell function by utilizing longitudinal data from multiple study time points in mixed - model analyses . compared with placebo , 
 rosiglitazone significantly increased igi after adjustment for age and homa - ir ( p = 0.015 ) ( table 3 ) . 
 in contrast , ramipril did not significantly affect adjusted igi ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 similar findings were seen using pi concentration as a measure of -cell function . specifically , rosiglitazone significantly reduced pi concentrations over time after adjustment for age and c - peptide concentration ( p = 0.0064 ) ( table 3 ) . 
 in contrast , ramipril did not significantly change adjusted pi concentrations ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 longitudinal changes in markers of -cell function in dream trial : analysis of slopes using mixed - model analysis analysis in table are based on full data ; results essentially unchanged when analysis repeated on subjects with information from all visits . 
 we assessed whether the impact of ramipril and/or rosiglitazone on diabetes incidence was independent of baseline levels or changes in indexes of -cell function with time ( fig . 
 1 ) . after accounting for baseline -cell function as measured by either igi or pi in models that adjusted for insulin resistance and other covariates , 
 rosiglitazone significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes ( hazard ratio 0.32 [ 95% ci 0.220.45 ] , p < 0.001 , and 0.33 [ 0.230.47 ] , p < 0.001 , in igi and pi models , respectively ) . adjusting for the change in -cell function as measured by igi attenuated the preventive effect of rosiglitazone on incident diabetes ( 0.53 [ 0.280.99 ] , p = 0.046 ) . 
 such attenuation was not noted when the change in -cell was measured using pi ( 0.28 [ 0.180.42 ] , p < 0.0001 ) ( fig . 
 association of treatment allocation with risk of diabetes : impact of baseline levels and changes in -cell function . for igi / ir models : model 1 adjusted for age and baseline igi , homa - ir , fasting glucose , waist circumference , triglyceride , and hdl ; model 2 adjusted for age and changes in igi , homa - ir , fasting glucose , waist circumference , triglyceride , and hdl . 
 for pi / c models : model 1 adjusted for age and baseline pi , c - peptide , fasting glucose , waist circumference , triglyceride , and hdl ; model 2 adjusted for age and changes in pi , c - peptide , fasting glucose , waist circumference , triglyceride , and hdl . 
 rosiglitazone , but not ramipril , improved measures of -cell function over time in people with ifg and/or igt . 
 specifically , rosiglitazone increased igi / ir and reduced pi / c by 86 and 42% , respectively . 
 these findings were consistent across glucose tolerance subgroups ( iifg , iigt , and ifg+igt ) , although there was the suggestion of a more modest effect in the subgroup with iifg . 
 finally , rosiglitazone 's effect on diabetes prevention persisted after adjustment for baseline -cell function . 
 the demonstration that an agent that reduces diabetes incidence also improves -cell function invites the hypothesis that measures of change in -cell function in response to therapy are indexes of that therapy 's ability to reduce the incidence of diabetes . 
 the modest attenuation of rosiglitazone 's effect after accounting for the change in -cell function suggests that some but not all of the effect of rosiglitazone on diabetes prevention / delay is mediated through its effects on -cell function . whereas a number of previous studies ( 911 ) have documented improvements in -cell function with tzd treatment in people with diabetes , only four studies ( 1215 ) have investigated this question in people with ifg and/or igt . 
 the results of these studies have been inconsistent , with two studies ( 12,15 ) indicating a significant improvement in measures of -cell function with tzd treatment and two studies ( 13,14 ) reporting no change . 
 these studies all had small sample sizes ( n  30 ) , and the methods used to assess -cell function varied widely from intensive approaches ( insulin responses to glucose infusion ) to simple fasting - based indexes ( homa - b ) . 
 interestingly , the complexity of the method used to assess -cell function did not appear to explain the differences in findings of these previous studies ( 12,14 ) . 
 finally , in a diabetes prevention trial among hispanic women with previous gestational diabetes , 70% of whom had igt at enrollment , treatment with troglitazone resulted in significant improvements in the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance 
 our results suggest a significant improvement in -cell function with tzd treatment in pre - diabetic subjects . 
 first , the sample size of our study ( n = 982 ) was much larger that previous investigations . 
 second , we demonstrated improvements in -cell function under tzd treatment using two validated , widely used proxy measures of -cell function , namely igi and pi . 
 third , in our analysis we accounted for the compensatory impact on -cell function of background insulin resistance . specifically , in analyses of igi we used homa - ir either as a covariate in multivariate analysis or as the denominator in the igi  to  homa - ir ratio . 
 accounting for background insulin resistance is crucial to the interpretation of -cell function measures in this study because tzds improved insulin sensitivity , thus reducing pancreatic -cell demand . 
 the exact mechanisms responsible for the increases in igi / ir and the reductions in pi / c documented in the present study are not known , although a number of possibilities exist . the reduction in insulin resistance with tzds 
 would be expected to reduce insulin secretory demand on the -cells and thus reduce -cell stress . 
 in addition , tzds such as rosiglitazone may improve -cell function indirectly by ameliorating a number of pathogenic processes that have been shown to be detrimental to the -cells , including lipotoxicity , glucotoxicity , and inflammation ( 7,8 ) . 
 tzds lower free fatty acids ( 22 ) , elevated levels of which result in excess deposition of lipid within -cells , which in turn leads to increases in ceremide and the stimulation of nitric oxide 
 mediated -cell apoptosis . as well , the glucose - lowering effect of tzds may reduce the impact of reactive oxygen species on the -cells , which are known to be especially susceptible to oxidative damage ( 23 ) . 
 finally , tzds have been demonstrated to reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines ( 24 ) , which may induce -cell apoptosis when chronically elevated . 
 tzds may also impact -cell function directly by maintaining -cell proliferation and/or reducing -cell apoptosis ( 25 ) . in the hope study , 
 treatment with ramipril was shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes in middle - aged individuals with vascular disease . in the dream trial , although ramipril did not significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes in people with ifg and/or igt , it did significantly increase regression to normoglycemia . 
 the mechanism by which ramipril might reduce glucose levels and/or prevent / delay diabetes is unknown , although vascular and metabolic effects on the muscle and pancreatic -cell have been proposed ( 16 ) . 
 the results of the present study suggest that ramipril does not have significant effects on -cell function compared with placebo in people at high risk for diabetes , and thus its glucose - lowering effects may operate through other metabolic mechanisms . 
 the improvement in -cell function in the placebo arm of the ramipril marginal group analysis may be explained by the fact that under the factorial design of the dream trial , half of the participants on ramipril placebo were receiving active rosiglitazone . the major strengths of the present study include the large sample size , the randomized , double - blind design , and the completeness of follow - up ( 92.6% ) . 
 further , participants were thoroughly characterized in terms of glucose tolerance status and were all in the pre - diabetic range ( either iifg , iigt , or ifg+igt ) . 
 the major limitation of the present study is the lack of detailed measures of -cell function , such as those obtained from the hyperglycemic clamp technique or the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test . 
 notwithstanding , we used two proxy measures of -cell function that have been extensively validated and used in previous studies including the diabetes prevention program and the american diabetes association genetics of type 2 diabetes study ( in the case of igi / ir ) and the iras study ( in the case of pi ) . in conclusion , 
 rosiglitazone , but not ramipril , resulted in significant improvements in measures of -cell function over time . 
 these findings demonstrate that the diabetes preventive effect of rosiglitazone may in part be a consequence of improved -cell function . 
 ","objectivethe objective of this study was to determine the degree to which ramipril and/or rosiglitazone changed -cell function over time among individuals with impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) and/or impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) who participated in the diabetes reduction assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone medication ( dream ) trial , which evaluated whether ramipril and/or rosiglitazone could prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in high - risk individuals.research design and methodsthe present analysis included subjects ( n = 982 ) from dream trial centers in canada who had oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline , after 2 years , and at the end of the study . 
 -cell function was assessed using the fasting proinsulin  to  c - peptide ratio ( pi / c ) and the insulinogenic index ( defined as 300 min insulin/300 min glucose ) divided by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( insulinogenic index [ igi]/insulin resistance [ ir]).resultssubjects receiving rosiglitazone had a significant increase in igi / ir between baseline and end of study compared with the placebo group ( 25.59 vs. 1.94 , p < 0.0001 ) and a significant decrease in pi / c ( 0.010 vs. 0.006 , p < 0.0001 ) . 
 in contrast , there were no significant changes in igi / ir or pi / c in subjects receiving ramipril compared with placebo ( 11.71 vs. 18.15 , p = 0.89 , and 0.007 vs. 0.008 , p = 0.64 , respectively ) . 
 the impact of rosiglitazone on igi / ir and pi / c was similar within subgroups of isolated igt and ifg + igt ( all p < 0.001 ) . 
 effects were more modest in those with isolated ifg ( igi / ir : 8.95 vs. 2.13 , p = 0.03 ; pi / c : 0.003 vs. 0.001 , p = 0.07).conclusionstreatment with rosiglitazone , but not ramipril , resulted in significant improvements in measures of -cell function over time in pre - diabetic subjects . although the long - term sustainability of these improvements can not be determined from the present study , these findings demonstrate that the diabetes preventive effect of rosiglitazone was in part a consequence of improved -cell function .",pubmed
"the generation of a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mab ) that inhibits the interaction of vegf - a with its receptors vegfr-1 and vegfr-2 and the development of small - molecule protein tyrosine kinase ( ptk ) inhibitors to the cytoplasmic regions of the vegf receptors have provided avenues to explore the efficacy of targeting the vegf - a signaling pathway in cancer . 
 extensive mouse tumor models developed through the 1990s led to the success of the vegf - a mab known as avastin ( or bevacizumab ) in treating a range of human cancers including colorectal cancer , lung cancer , and renal cell carcinoma . 
 however , the recent withdrawal of avastin for treating breast cancer in the united states has highlighted the limitations of anti - angiogenic treatments , as well as the need for a careful cost - benefit analysis to ensure that scarce healthcare resources are well spent in the treatment of cancer . while avastin is clearly beneficial in a subset of cancer patients , the development of resistance to avastin and 
 the pre - existing refractoriness of some tumors suggest the role of other growth factors in sustaining tumor angiogenesis . 
 alternative ligands ( other than vegf - a ) for the angiogenic receptor vegfr-2 ( i.e. , vegf - c and vegf - d ; see below ) and other angiogenic factors from distinct growth factor families [ e.g. , fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) ] are logical candidates for promoting resistance to avastin . in addition , 
 other mechanisms , such as vascular mimicry , the involvement of endothelial precursor cells ( epcs ) or altered tumor metabolism leading to reduced oxygen requirement , may also contribute to the development of resistance . 
 pigf is a ligand for vegfr-1 , which has been reported to play a dual role in cancer as a stimulator of angiogenesis and as an autocrine or paracrine factor promoting proliferation of tumor cells expressing vegfr-11 , . 
 it has also been proposed that pigf may modulate the effect of vegf - a by displacing vegf - a from vegfr-1 expressed on endothelial cells . 
 a range of animal tumor models have provided supportive or contradictory data on the role of pigf in driving tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth , . 
 these findings suggest a context - dependent activity for pigf in cancer , either due to the presence of other vegf family members or the diverse expression of vegf receptors on various cell types including endothelial cells , tumor cells , or associated immune cells , . 
 while vegf - b , a ligand for vegfr-1 , has been shown to be expressed in human cancer , its functions in arteriogenesis and in fatty acid uptake by cells have highlighted its role in other pathologies , predominantly cardiovascular disease . 
 recently , vegf - b was shown to regulate endothelial cell uptake and transport of fatty acids in muscle , leading to the hypothesis that vegf - b antagonists could be used as novel pharmacologic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes . 
 although inhibitory antibodies against vegf - b have been developed , so far there is little data on the role of this growth factor in tumor biology ; it was reported , however , that overexpression of vegf - b in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer suppressed tumor growth , highlighting the differences in biological functions between the vegf family members . 
 vegf - c and vegf - d form a subfamily within the vegf family , consisting of highly related polypeptides that require post - translational cleavage of the n- and c - terminal propeptides to generate mature forms with enhanced binding affinities for vegfr-2 and vegfr-3,. notably , vegfr-3 is expressed on lymphatic endothelium , where it can promote lymphangiogenesis , and it is also expressed on angiogenic blood vessels . 
 vegf - c is expressed in a range of human cancers , including solid tumors such as nasopharyngeal , liver and gastric cancers , with a preponderance in asian populations . 
 mouse tumor studies have displayed the ability of vegf - c to promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vivo and to drive tumor growth and metastatic spread. given that the mature form of vegf - c is a high affinity ligand for vegfr-2 and that vegf - c is expressed in many human cancers , vegf - c is likely to be an alternative ligand to vegf - a for vegfr-2binding , which could in turn promote tumor angiogenesis . 
 therefore , vegf - c , in combination with anti - angiogenic drugs such as avastin , may be a viable target for anti - cancer therapy . 
 the growth factor vegf - d is closely related in structure to vegf - c , and it includes a central vegf homology domain ( vhd ) related to other vegf family members , with n- and c - terminal propeptides that can be proteolytically cleaved by enzymes such as proprotein convertases and plasm in , , . 
 vegf - d is expressed in a range of human cancers , , and has been associated with poor patient outcome in some tumor types , . 
 importantly , animal models of cancer have demonstrated that vegf - d can promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , solid tumor growth , dilation of collecting lymphatic vessels , and lymphatic and distant organ metastasis. the proteolytic processing of vegf - d is required for promoting tumor growth and spread . 
 opportunities for targeting vegf - d signaling in cancer could involve mabs specific to the vhd of vegf - d that are capable of inhibiting binding to vegfr-2 and vegfr-3 , , . 
 alternatively , ptk inhibitors that block vegfr-2 and vegfr-3 signaling would interfere with vegf - d - mediated signal transduction . 
 further , mabs to vegfr-2 and vegfr-3 , that would prevent the binding of vegf - d , or a soluble form of vegfr-3 that could sequester both vegf - c and vegf - d , could be employed . 
 targeting the vegf - d signaling pathway would likely have the merit of inhibiting both tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , which could , in turn , restrict both solid tumor growth and metastatic spread . 
 what have the past 20 years taught us about targeting vegf - a signaling ? clearly , this period has provided biochemists , biologists , and clinicians the time to design and evaluate a variety of agents that modify or inhibit these signaling pathways . 
 the agents that were developed have included a broad range of molecules targeting different components of the pathways , including vegf - a itself , vegf receptors , vegf co - receptors , ptks and signaling intermediates , and transcription factors . during this period , 
 other vegf family members were also identified , enhancing the diversity of signaling induced by the vegf family of ligands . 
 avastin , a humanized mab to vegf - a , has been widely used in a range of prevalent human cancers over the past 8 years , typically in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy . 
 although this agent has provided significant benefit to cancer patients , there is a need for other drugs that could be combined with avastin to deliver improved clinical outcomes . 
 use of agents targeting other vegf family members , in combination with avastin , may be a potential approach . 
 further , small - molecule ptk inhibitors of vegf receptors ( that are not highly specific ) have been employed although dose - limiting toxicity in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy has restricted their widespread use . 
 further insights into the structure and function of the ptk domains of vegf receptors may allow development of more specific small - molecule ptk inhibitors . 
 further studies delving into the complex network of signaling cascades that drive angiogenesis , lymphangiogenesis , and resistance to anti - angiogenic drugs such as avastin are clearly required . 
 genome - wide functional approaches such as those using small interfering rna ( sirna ) technology , supported by bioinformatics , could help strategize effective targeting of growth factors , receptors , and ptks . 
 agents specifically targeting vegf family members and their receptors are currently in various stages of development ; mabs to vegf - b , vegf - c , vegf - d , pigf , vegfr-1 , vegfr-2 , and vegfr-3 are being evaluated by the biotechnology and pharmaceutic industries for their efficacy as anti - cancer agents . for these mabs , 
 a key challenge will be identifying specific cancer indications in which clinical benefit can be achieved . 
 given that many cancers are resistant to avastin or develop resistance over the course of treatment , these mabs may be tested in patients whose cancers are avastin - resistant and/or whose cancers express the appropriate target growth factor . 
 hence , assays that quantitate the levels of these growth factors or other relevant biomarkers will be required to identify the appropriate patients , although assessing these biomarkers may not be straightforward . 
 vegf family members are secreted proteins , which may easily allow testing in blood - drawn samples ; however , some family members ( e.g. , vegf - c and vegf - d ) are proteo - lytically processed to generate forms with a different bioactivity . 
 hence , it will be important to fully appreciate which forms are most bioactive and clinically relevant . 
 it is important to note that inhibiting signaling by vegf family members could potentially have pro - tumor effects . 
 recent studies have demonstrated that anti - angiogenic treatments could cause increased tumor metastasis through mechanisms such as the induction of hypoxia ( caused by vegf - a inhibition ) , resulting in increased tumor cell motility , . 
 nonetheless , these issues have been addressed in various tumor models and by comparing the effect of antibodies and small - molecule inhibitors to show that anti 
 clearly , other signaling pathways ( i.e. , not directly involving vegf family members ) such as those driven by members of the platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) , and fgf growth factor families , exert control on tumor angiogenesis and may be important in promoting tumor growth . other alternative molecular targets , such as c - met , may also be able to affect multiple tumor properties such as metastasis , angiogenesis , tumor growth , and cellular motility upon hypoxia. although not the subject of this review , such pathways may provide valid therapeutic targets for inhibiting angiogenesis and/or lymphangio - genesis in cancer , thereby restricting tumor growth and spread . 
 furthermore , recent studies from our own laboratory have indicated the role of known inflammatory pathways in enhancing the spread of cancer , opening avenues for the use of existing anti - inflammatory drugs in cancer . this possibility is further exemplified by the recent studies published by rothwell et al . 
 , demonstrating the anti - cancer effect of non - steroidal anti- inflam matory drugs ( nsaids ) such as aspirin . while expensive drugs such as avastin allow the treatment of specific cancers in the western world , the capacity to employ relatively inexpensive  off - patent  small molecules ( such as aspirin ) with a defined chemistry and known biological effects could provide a cost - effective and population - based preventative approach to cancer in asian countries .","the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) family of soluble protein growth factors consists of key mediators of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the context of tumor biology . 
 the members of the family , vegf - a ( also known as vegf ) , vegf - b , vegf - c , vegf - d , and placenta growth factor ( pigf ) , play important roles in vascular biology in both normal physiology and pathology . 
 the generation of a humanized neutralizing antibody to vegf - a ( bevacizumab , also known as avastin ) and the demonstration of its benefit in numerous human cancers have confirmed the merit of an anti - angiogenesis approach to cancer treatment and have validated the vegf - a signaling pathway as a therapeutic target . 
 other members of the vegf family are now being targeted , and their relevance to human cancer and the development of resistance to anti - vegf - a treatment are being evaluated in the clinic . here , we discuss the potential of targeting vegf family members in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer .",pubmed
"over the last two decades many new immunotherapy approaches to the treatment of cancer have entered clinical development due to the increased understanding of the mechanisms of antigen presentation , lymphocyte recognition , functions of the innate immune system , and the means of regulation of these responses and the means by which tumors can circumvent these responses . 
 many of these investigations have led to agents approved for standard clinical use , including infusional cytokine therapies for melanoma or renal cell cancer , intravesical bcg therapy for bladder cancer , and most recently an active cellular therapy targeting prostatic acid phosphatase ( pap , sipuleucel - t , provenge , dendreon ) for patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer . 
 many other agents have demonstrated benefit in large clinical trials , and approval is anticipated in the case of a monoclonal antibody targeting a t - cell checkpoint inhibitor targeting ctla-4 ( ipilimumab , bristol - myers squibb ) for advanced melanoma . 
 ultimately , for these agents to be clinically approved there needs to be a demonstration that these treatments are relatively safe and patient care and outcome are positively affected .   however , there is also an increasing recognition that some of these agents , while likely safe , may best be used in combination with other immune - activating or conventional therapies . 
 this has presented challenges for evaluating these agents using traditional paradigms for clinical development . 
 consequently there is a need to identify markers of biological response , ideally associated with clinical outcome , but permitting an evaluation of biological effect of these agents used in combination .   in the case of antigen - specific vaccines 
 , it has been relatively straightforward to evaluate immune responses to the target antigen as a 
 biomarker  of immunological efficacy .   unfortunately , there are few instances in which target antigen immune response has been associated with clinical benefit . 
 the situation is more difficult for broadly active immune modulating agents such as t - cell checkpoint inhibitors , including antibodies targeting ctla-4 or pd-1 , or tlr agonists , in which appropriate biomarkers of response have been more elusive . 
 studies with anti - ctla-4 monoclonal antibodies , in particular , have sought to identify whether amplification of other t - cell costimulatory molecules , or antibodies to defined antigenic tumor - associated proteins [ 2 , 3 ] , might be useful as biomarkers . 
 for whole cell tumor vaccines where there is not a specific , defined antigen being targeted , surrogate antigens known to be expressed by the tumor vaccine have been used as a means of monitoring immune responses from the vaccine . 
 the use of immunologically recognized surrogate antigens , including her-2/neu , muc1 , and p53 , has been possible in the case of breast cancer where t - cell and igg responses to these antigens have been identified . 
 however it is unknown whether responses to these antigens can be useful to study agents in combination or whether changes in responses to these antigens are associated with clinical outcome .      over the last several years we have used 
 serex- ( serological analysis of recombinant cdna expression libraries ) based studies to identify immunologically recognized proteins expressed by normal and malignant prostate tissue that might serve as targets for anti - tumor vaccines . 
 in particular , we have evaluated the targets of igg responses in patients with chronic prostatitis or autoimmune disorders [ 8 , 9 ] , patients with prostate cancer treated with immune - modulating therapies , and igg responses to cancer - testis antigens in patients with prostate cancer [ 11 , 12 ] .   over the course of these studies we have effectively identified hundreds of immunologically recognized proteins associated with prostate tissue and/or recognized by patients with prostate cancer . 
 while the identification of hundreds of proteins presents challenges in prioritization for the development of antigen - specific vaccines , we previously questioned whether these antigens might also have diagnostic value with igg responses being able to distinguish individuals with prostate cancer ( or other inflammatory conditions of the prostate ) from men without prostate disease . 
 other groups have similarly reported that igg responses to tissue - associated antigens might have diagnostic value in identifying patients with prostate cancer   or nonsmall cell lung cancer . 
 we have previously reported that a subset of 23 of these antigens were recognized in patients with prostate cancer as well as individuals with symptomatic prostatitis , suggesting that such autoantibody signatures might be useful to identify inflammatory conditions of the prostate , and potentially in a premalignant setting .    in the current report 
 , we hypothesized that this same panel of previously identified prostate - associated antigens might be used as a monitoring tool to assess immune responses elicited following immune - modulating therapy . 
 while b - cells or igg production might not be an intended target of a particular therapeutic approach , igg responses are often elicited with concurrent t - cell activation . 
 we reasoned that igg responses are easier to measure compared with antigen - specific t cells , and might be more stable over time in the peripheral blood compared with t - cell frequencies . 
 moreover , the identification of  off - target  igg immune responses might further serve as an indication of  antigen spread  with secondary antigens recognized following immunological targeting and thus be more relevant to developing biomarkers associated with favorable clinical responses .   to detect antibody responses to previously defined antigens , we applied a similar phage immunoblot approach evaluating igg responses to multiple antigens simultaneously . 
 these types of complex biomarker data sets are historically very difficult to work with for two reasons : first is the complexity associated with biological networks ; second is the challenge of infrequent observation of immune biomarkers in a complex system .   as such , the identification of useful biomarkers in data sets such as 
 this study can be very challenging .   in this paper , we sought to evaluate the use of machine - learned bayesian belief networks ( ml - bbns ) as a method for identifying potentially promising biomarkers and potential biomarkers networks [ 16 , 17 ] . 
 we sought to train several ml - bbns to identify promising biomarkers and then use these networks to select a subset of features to train a network of immune biomarkers as they related to observed declines in serum prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) . 
 our objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of this method to identify promising early biomarkers of immune response to vaccine therapies in our data . 
 for the current studies , sera samples were collected prior to treatment and after three months of treatment from three separate trials , one in which patients ( n = 34 ) were treated with androgen deprivation ( adt ) therapy only , a standard therapy known to elicit prostate - associated immune responses [ 1820 ] , a trial in which patients with castrate - resistant prostate cancer ( n = 31 ) were treated with a viral vaccine encoding psa ( psav ) , and one in which patients with early recurrent prostate cancer ( n = 21 ) were treated with a plasmid dna vaccine encoding pap ( papv ) . 
 patients treated with vaccines were subclassified as immunologic or clinical  responders  based on previously reported criteria to distinguish these groups . 
 we report here that igg immune responses could be detected to individual antigens , and as long as one year after therapy the recognition of specific antigens was associated with individual treatments . 
 the evaluation of igg responses to groups of antigens at three months suggests that predictive models might be developed with diagnostic potential . 
 these findings support the concept of using measures of  antigen spread  as biomarkers of immunological efficacy for immune - active therapies , and igg responses to panels of tissue - associated antigens as measures of this antigen spread . 
 sera used for the studies had been previously collected with irb - approved , written consent as part of three separate clinical trials ( figure 1 ) . 
 these samples were all obtained prior to study treatment and after 3 months of treatment in the following settings :   ( 1 ) a trial ( adt ) in which patients ( n = 34 ) with psa - recurrent , or newly metastatic prostate cancer , who had never previously received androgen deprivation , received 22.5  mg leuprolide by intramuscular injection with or without daily oral bicalutamide ; ( 2 ) a trial ( psav ) in which patients ( n = 31 ) with castrate - resistant , metastatic prostate cancer were vaccinated at 2-week intervals with a poxviral vaccine ( prostvac , vaccinia virus encoding psa priming immunization followed by fowlpox virus encoding psa booster immunizations ; ( 3 ) a trial ( papv ) in which patients ( n = 21 ) with psa - recurrent nonmetastatic prostate cancer , not receiving androgen deprivation , were vaccinated at 2-week intervals with a plasmid dna vaccine encoding pap .   from the majority of patients treated with adt ( n = 24 of 34 ) or papv ( n = 19 of 21 ) , serum samples were also available 12 months after the baseline sample .   from the vaccine studies , patients were grouped as clinical 
 responders  or  non - responders  as simply defined by a decrease in serum psa level at the 3-month time point relative to the baseline value . 
 100,000  pfu lambda phage encoding 126 unique antigens were spotted manually in triplicate in a 1624 array onto xl-1 blue e. coli . 
 these individual antigens included 29 cancer - testis antigens , 40 proteins identified in patients with chronic prostatitis , and 57 antigens identified in individual patients , some of whom were treated with androgen deprivation or other immunomodulatory therapies [ 9 , 10 , 20 ] .   a listing of antigens and their genbank accession numbers is included in supplemental table 1 in supplementary material available online at doi:10.1155/2011/454861 . 
 plates were allowed to air - dry after which 10-mm isopropyl  - d - thiogalactopyranoside- ( iptg ) suffused nitrocellulose membranes were overlain , and plates incubated at 37c overnight to allow recombinant protein expression . 
 membranes were then washed , blocked , and probed with sera from patients pre- or post - treatment , diluted 1  :  100 in isotonic buffer . 
 human igg was then detected with an igg - specific secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and immunoreactivity detected by development with 0.3  mg / ml nitro blue tertazolium chloride ( nbt ) ( fisher biotech ) and 0.15  mg / ml 5-bromo 4-chloro 3-indoylphosphate ( bcip ) ( fisher biotech ) .   membranes were scanned and the digital format was assessed visually , with individual plaques scored positive or not by four independent observers , blinded to the treatment , timing of sample acquisition and membrane layout , as previously reported [ 8 , 15 ] . 
 all of the membranes for the entire study were evaluated by the same observers at the same time . 
 triplicate samples were evaluated for each antigen , and immunoreactivity to individual antigens was scored positive if there was concordance among 3 of 4 observers , and if immunoreactivity was scored positive in at least two of the three replicates . 
 heatmap builder software ( version 1.1 , stanford university ) was used to generate heatmaps displaying changes ( gain , loss , or no change ) of antibody immune responses following treatment .    our statistical analysis consisted of using a commercially available machine - learning software package ( fasteranalytics , decisionq corporation , washington , dc ) . 
 machine learning is a field of computer science that uses intelligent algorithms to allow a computer to mimic the process of human learning . 
 machine learning algorithms allow the computer to learn dynamically from the data that resides in the training dataset , detecting associations between features without human supervision . 
 decisionq software generates several networks simultaneously and then continues to generate new hypotheses for each network . 
 the software promotes the network with the best score as determined by goodness of fit relative to compactness . 
 this allows for de novo exploration of associations in complex data sets .    in preprocessing our data , we compared the pre- and post - treatment status of biomarkers and encoded the change in each biomarker as a feature . 
 we then used these encoded features and clinical response ( psa decline ) to train models . 
 the output of our machine - learning algorithms is a bayesian belief network ( bbn ) . 
 a bbn encodes the joint probability distribution of all the variables in the domain by building a hierarchical network of conditional dependence . 
 the graphical nature of the network allows the user to query the structure of conditional dependence to identify those features which provide the most information content in the network .   in order to select a subset of features for inclusion in a final model 
 , we used a stepwise process and trained a series of machine - learned ( ml)bbns for feature selection . 
 we used this stepwise process as a means of identifying nodes with relatively high information content given our statistically challenging biomarker data sets . 
 because these data sets have a very high degree of dimensionality ( features ) relative to evidence ( number of subjects ) , finding those features with the highest information content can be very challenging .   to address this challenge , we trained multiple bbn - ml models and identified those features which recurred across multiple models as evidence of high information content . 
 we modeled each of our study cohorts ( adt , psav , papv ) and then compared to the model structures between individual cohorts to identify shared nodes . 
 we also identified high - content nodes ( greater than 10 associations ) and combined these with the shared nodes to create a selected subset or training a final model to evaluate a network of biomarkers to evaluate clinical response ( psa decline ) . 
 we used our selected markers to then train three additional models : ( i ) a final subset model including clinical response ( psa decline ) on the vaccine cohorts , ( ii ) a model of subjects in the vaccine studies who were immune responders , and ( iii ) a model of subjects who were not immune responders in the vaccine studies . 
 finally , we performed tenfold cross - validation on our clinical response subset model and used receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analysis to calculate an area - under - the - curve ( auc ) metric for the feature psa decline , to determine if the subset model could robustly classify clinical response given immune biomarkers 
 . the frequencies of igg responses to individual antigens were compared between treatment study populations using a chi - square test . 
 we have previously reported that antibody responses to prostate antigens can be detected in patients with prostate cancer or other inflammatory conditions of the prostate . 
 moreover , a subset of these prostate - associated antigens was commonly recognized in patients , relative to men without prostate disease , suggesting that the detection of igg responses to specific prostate - associated antigens might have diagnostic value .   in the current analysis , we wished to determine whether the detection of igg responses to a panel of prostate - associated antigens might have utility in the evaluation of vaccine or other immunomodulatory therapies aimed specifically at eliciting immune responses to the prostate .   for this 
 , we obtained sera from men with prostate cancer prior to and following three months of therapy with standard androgen deprivation therapy ( n = 34 ) , and from men with prostate cancer ( n = 52 ) prior to and following three months of therapy with one of two different antigen - specific vaccines ( figure 1 ) . 
 sera from these individuals were used to screen for igg responses to a panel of 126 antigens by immunoblot , as previously described . 
 responses to all antigens were evaluated in blinded fashion at both time points , and in figure 2 , changes in igg responses ( gain or loss of response ) after 3 months were determined . 
 as demonstrated , androgen deprivation elicited immune responses to multiple antigens , and in particular to antigens previously identified as antigens recognized in patients with chronic prostatitis [ 8 , 15 ] . 
 responses to these prostatitis antigens were uncommon over a similar 3-month period in patients treated with either of the vaccines .   gain or loss of igg responses to some antigens appeared to be shared by these different treatments , while responses to some appeared more specific for individual treatments .   of note , 
 gain or loss of igg responses to psa , while detected in one individual treated with adt , were not detected in patients receiving the psa - tricom vaccine . 
 similarly igg responses to pap were not detected in any of the patients , including those receiving the pap - targeted vaccine , as previously reported . 
 we next wanted to determine whether igg responses observed were generally stable , or increased over time , and also identify more specifically whether responses to some antigens were more generally associated with different therapies .   in the majority of patients treated with adt and papv , 
 evaluation of igg responses gained or lost after 12 months of adt , or 12 months after pap vaccine treatment compared with baseline demonstrated overall an increased number of antigens recognized ( figure 3 ) . 
 interestingly , responses to individual antigens were observed to be highly specific for the treatment . 
 for example , igg responses were elicited to the ribosomal l5 protein in 8/24 patients receiving adt , and 0/19 patients after receiving the papv ( p = .005 , chi - square test ) . 
 similarly , igg responses elicited to the neuronal pas domain protein 2 ( npas2 ) antigen were observed more frequently in patients receiving the pap vaccine ( 5/19 ) compared with patients receiving androgen deprivation ( 0/24 , p = .0075 , chi - square test ) .   even after one year 
 , responses gained or lost to antigens previously identified as prostatitis antigens were not detected in patients treated with the vaccine .   while we did not have access to a control population of sera from untreated men , given that these represented populations of subjects with nearly identical stage of disease , collected at the same institution , the differences in igg response patterns to individual antigens appears most related to the difference in treatment . 
 moreover , these findings suggest that igg responses are elicited to  off - target  antigens by means of prostate - directed therapies , and the patterns of igg responses differ with respect to therapy . 
 the results above demonstrated that , indeed , igg immune responses are elicited as a result of prostate - directed immune - active therapies . 
 moreover , antigen - specific igg immune responses were highly associated with specific treatments , suggesting that the generation of immune responses to these  off - target  antigens might be associated with other measures of immune response or clinical outcome .   these responses , however , were most detectable at 12 months after therapy initiation , a time relatively late to be useful in most circumstances as a predictive biomarker . 
 responses detectable at three months would be more useful .   however , the sample sizes for each individual trial were small , and multiple comparisons made by evaluating igg responses to multiple antigens present difficulties in statistically assessing the importance of an individual marker .    consequently , we evaluated igg responses to multiple antigens by training a ml - bbn model to determine whether we could identify groups of igg responses that are associated with clinical response , using data obtained at three months .   because the vaccine trials were conducted in different patient populations where different definitions of clinical response were used , we defined it simply for this purpose as a serum psa value at the 3-month time point lower than the baseline time point ( n = 1 for the papv trial , and n = 4 for the psav trial subjects ) . 
 we identified nine ( 9 ) biomarkers that were shared between one or more model structures , as described in table 1 , as well as two high - content nodes in the all - cohort model . 
 this resulted in a final subset of biomarkers to include in the final ml - bbn model : chromosome 20 gene contig change , rp11 - 738b7 dna on chromosome 7 change , chromosome 1 gene contig change1 , prolactin - induced protein change , acetyl - coenzyme a acyltransferase 1 change , bac rp11 - 321g3 change , cutaneous t - cell lymphoma tumor antigen sel-1 change , neuronal pas domain protein 2 change , o - fucosyltansferase change , page 1 change , and recombination signal binding protein ( rbpjk ) change . 
 this indicates that there are two first - degree associates of psa decline , igg responses to chromosome 1 gene contig 1 and bac rp11 - 321g3 , and three immune biomarkers features which can be used to estimate psa decline : igg responses to chromosome 1 gene contig 1 , bac rp11 - 321g3 , and rp11 - 738b7 dna on chromosome 7 . 
 further , these biomarkers are associated with igg responses to chromosome 20 gene contig , o - fucosyltansferase , page 1 , and cutaneous t - cell lymphoma tumor antigen sel-1 
 .   to evaluate the robustness of this model , we performed tenfold cross - validation and calculated an auc for clinical response ( psa decline ) of 0.357 . 
 this indicates that our first model is not a robust classifier , but is rather an exploratory model . 
 in the current report , we sought to determine whether serum antibody responses to a panel of prostate tissue- and prostate cancer - associated antigens might be developed as a diagnostic tool to evaluate immune responses elicited following immune - active therapies , and further to determine whether this might be developed in the future as a biomarker of clinical response . 
 using sera obtained from patients treated with three different therapies , we found that antigen - specific igg responses could be detected , likely elicited as a result of therapy . 
 the patterns of response differed with respect to the individual therapy , and recognition of specific antigens was most evident at a later ( 12 months following treatment ) than at an earlier time point ( 3 months following treatment ) .   using a ml - bbn model to evaluate groups of igg responses detected three months after treatment , we prioritized a cohort of antigens , immune responses to which were most associated with psa decline . 
 these findings suggest that , with data from larger populations of subjects , models could be developed to assist in the detection of potentially therapeutic immune responses resulting from immune - based therapies . 
 our results demonstrate that immune - active therapies , including androgen deprivation , elicit igg responses to individual prostate - associated antigens .   this has already been demonstrated in previous studies [ 18 , 20 ] ; however , the igg responses from androgen deprivation therapy were most obvious many months after treatment , where responses to individual antigens were common and predominantly induced rather than lost .   it is conceivable that some immune responses wax and wane over time , and in fact the detection of frequent gains and losses of immune responses to individual antigens , common across treatment groups detected earlier at three months , suggests that this can happen with some antigens . 
 ideally , to control for this , we would have preferred to have sera samples from men without prostate cancer and/or not undergoing active treatment over the same periods of time .   in the absence of this , however , we did have cohorts of subjects treated with different therapies . 
 given that different individual and sets of antigens were specifically recognized following these different therapies suggests that the responses observed were not purely by chance or due to the waxing and waning of responses to individual antigens . 
 the antigens recognized following androgen deprivation , in particular , were ones previously demonstrated to be commonly recognized by igg in patients with prostate cancer or inflammatory conditions of the prostate [ 8 , 15 ] . 
 we did not observe igg responses to pap in patients receiving the pap - targeted vaccine , nor igg responses to psa in patients receiving the psa - targeted vaccine . 
 this was actually not unexpected , as we have previously reported that these vaccines , while able to elicit antigen - specific t - cell responses , do not elicit robust antigen - specific igg in patients as detected by more sensitive elisa methods [ 6 , 22 ] . 
 the observation of igg responses elicited with these treatments to other antigens suggests that they may be presented by cross - presentation following immune - mediated tumor cell targeting .   of interest was the observation that the antigens recognized following androgen deprivation were different from those recognized following vaccine treatment .   theoretically , the recognition of other nonvaccine target antigens represents antigen spread induced by immune targeting and presentation of other tissue - associated antigens . 
 the recognition of different antigens suggests different mechanisms of antigen spread , or potentially recognition of other tissue - derived antigens , since most of the antigens in this panel are not prostate specific in expression .   at present 
 it is unclear whether the generation of such responses is favorable or not ; at least one report has suggested that the generation of igg responses to non - target antigens might be associated with a worse outcome . 
 future studies will explore whether the antigens recognized are shared among different vaccine approaches , suggesting common mechanisms of antigen spread , or whether different vaccine therapies elicit specific responses to different  off - target  antigens .   with larger group sizes 
 , we also hope to address whether responses to these antigens are associated with measures of t - cell immune responses to the target antigen , further implicating antigen spread as the mechanism of their recognition . 
 in addition , with larger group sizes we hope to answer whether these are clearly associated with improved clinical benefit or not , or whether this is dependent on treatment context and the specific antigen(s ) recognized , as we expect .    given the small sample size and the multitude of igg response data points , we sought to identify if the use of ml - bbn modeling was feasible to identify biomarker cohorts in our study data . 
 we were able to use a stepwise process and bbn model structures to identify those biomarkers which had high information content for use in a selected subset for ml - bbn modeling . 
 we were subsequently able to use this subset to train an ml - bbn including clinical response , however on cross - validation , our auc for clinical response was poor . 
 this is likely due to the fact that of the 52 vaccine subjects we only had 5  responders  as defined . 
 this resulted in a very small set of training outcomes , making models very sensitive to record deletion , as in the case of cross - validation . 
 psa response has itself not been validated as a surrogate clinical endpoint , and adt itself elicits initial psa responses in the vast majority of patients . 
 in addition , as further data are collected from additional subjects treated by vaccines , we expect this will produce a more robust predictive model .    in any case , the use of ml - bbn modeling appears to provide a promising method for identifying biomarkers in complex data sets that can then be selected for further analysis , as the same subset of biomarkers appeared to produce high information content in models across different populations . 
 further , once we have sufficient subjects to produce a robust model , tables of posterior estimates for clinical response given combinations of igg response biomarkers can be developed . 
 an example inference table is provided in table 2 , where those biomarkers that are predictive of clinical response can provide a posterior estimate of response . 
 this type of inference could support the translation of this research into a clinical application for determining whether an individual patient has  responded  from a particular vaccine therapy or potentially whether ongoing immunization should be performed . 
 future modeling might further permit the selection of patients who would be appropriate to receive vaccine therapy based on pre - existing immunological response parameters .","we previously demonstrated that igg responses to a panel of 126 prostate tissue - associated antigens are common in patients with prostate cancer .   in the current report we questioned whether changes in igg responses to this panel might be used as a measure of immune response , and potentially antigen spread , following prostate cancer - directed immune - active therapies . 
 sera were obtained from prostate cancer patients prior to and three months following treatment with androgen deprivation therapy ( n = 34 ) , a poxviral vaccine ( n = 31 ) , and a dna vaccine ( n = 21 ) 
 .   changes in igg responses to individual antigens were identified by phage immunoblot . 
 patterns of igg recognition following three months of treatment were evaluated using a machine - learned bayesian belief network ( ml - bbn ) . 
 we found that different antigens were recognized following androgen deprivation compared with vaccine therapies .   while the number of clinical responders was low in the vaccine - treated populations , 
 we demonstrate that ml - bbn can be used to develop potentially predictive models .",pubmed
"it is known that bone mass density and architecture are intimately dependent upon mechanical factors . 
 several in vitro studies suggest that cell mechanical stimulation promotes proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic lineage [ 1 , 2 ] , in agreement with the results from several in vivo studies [ 35 ] . 
 stress shielding causes bone loss through remodeling due to decreased loading , particularly in noncemented prostheses [ 6 , 7 ] . 
 several solutions have been proposed for these two mechanical problems , namely , design variations and development of controlled - stiffness implants [ 8 , 9 ] . a new approach to this problem , with potential application to other orthopedic problems and other medical fields , would be the development of smart implants integrating systems for bone mechanical stimulation . 
 the present in vivo study explores the use of the converse piezoelectric effect to mechanically stimulate bone with resource to polyvinylidene fluoride films ( pvdf ) ( measurement specialties inc company , usa ) . 
 these films were used , after dip - coating to improve cell adhesion and assure electrical insulation , as a substrate for mc3t3 cells to explore the concept of using piezoelectric materials and converse piezoelectric effect to produce effective osteoblast mechanical stimulation . 
 the coating was performed by dip - coating at constant velocity of 0,238  mm / s . 
 the chosen material for coating was an acrylic , poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) , ( perfex , international dental products , usa ) , used alone in the first three layers and a in forth layer along with 4% of bonelike ( 250500  m ) particles added ( kindly offered by inescporto ) . 
 the displacement was higher where the cells were seeded , in the central area of the coated devices , in the order of 700  nm along the z - axis , in a semisinusoidal fashion . 
 on the substrates submitted to dynamic conditions , stimulation was done with an alternating sinusoidal current ( ac ) , of 5  v , at 1  hz and 3  hz for 15 minutes at each frequency . in this exploratory in vivo study , 
 the same coating procedures and daily stimulation regimens were applied . the biological response around the osteotomies 
 was assessed through histology and histomorphometry in undecalcified sections , and through histochemistry and immunohistochemistry in decalcified sections , namely , through masson 's trichrome , and labeling of osteopontin ( opn ) , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) , and tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) . 
 the actuator device was composed of a microboard containing an ultra - low power 16-bit microcontroller ( ez430-rf2500 , texas instruments , usa ) , powered by lithium battery and encapsulated in pmma and a set of six actuators composed of polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) and silver electrodes , electrically insulated by dip - coating as described elsewhere . 
 each actuator measured 15  mm width and 40  mm length , with an active area of 12  31  mm . 
 the actuator device was programmed to apply a 5  v square wave of 1  hz and 3  hz for 15 minutes at each frequency , once every 24 hours . 
 finite numerical method studies and electronic speckle pattern interferometry process ( espi ) studies have shown the lower deformation levels occurred in the clamped region of the films , for a potential differential of 5  v , and the higher deformation occurred in the opposite extremity of the film . a control device , similar but static was also developed . a sterilization method was developed and validated based on iso 11737 - 1 and iso 14937 , using a series of decontaminating solutions ( 10% sodium hypochlorite for 20 minutes , without agitation , washing in sterile water , and immersion in 10% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes , without agitation , followed by rinse in sterile water and drying under laminar flux ) , before 2 hours of exposure to uv ( in two different positions ) . 
 the actuator device was implanted in the left hind limb , and a control device was implanted in the right hind limb , of a 4-year - old merino ewe , with 45  kg body - weight . 
 the animal was premedicated with atropine ( 0.7  mg / kg ) , xylazine ( 0.1  mg / kg ) and butorphanol ( 0.01  mg / kg ) , and anesthesia induced with thiopental sodium 5% ( 5  mg / kg ) by intravenous injection . the anesthesia was maintained through isoflurane with spontaneous ventilation . 
 the stifle joint of both legs was prepared with a solution of povidone - iodine and ethanol 70% , after being shorn and shaved . 
 two longitudinal incisions were made on the craniomedial border of the femur and at tibial crest level . 
 the tibial bone was exposed by reflecting deep medial fascia , the vastus medialis and cranial part of the sartorius muscles and the periosteum , and two osteotomies were made using an especially metal designed guide to make two regular and well - orientated osteotomies using an oscillating saw . 
 the bone was continuously irrigated with a sterile saline solution during the process of low - speed drilling and cutting . 
 the same procedure was followed with a different design guide for the distal femoral physis , where four osteotomies were done . 
 a stab wound was made in the fascia lata , and the extremities of the piezoelectric films passed through it , and then , the active area of each piezoelectric film was placed inside the slot osteotomy cavity . the actuator position inside the tibial bone can be clearly viewed in figure 1(a ) , obtained post - mortem . 
 the portion of the device containing the microprocessor and the power supply was left in the nearby subcutaneous space . 
 the actuator device was implanted in the left hind limb , and control on the right hind limb . after placing the implants , 
 incisions were closed routinely with a continuous - pattern suture in the retinaculum and fascia , using absorbable surgicryl 2/0 ( smi ag , belgium ) and in the skin with silk 0 ( smi ag ) . 
 postoperative x - ray images were obtained thirty days after implantation , before sacrifice , to ensure the proper evolution of the bone cuts and to detect signs of infection / inflammation ( figure 2 ) . 
 one week after implantation calcein ( 15  mg / kg ; sigma , usa ) was injected subcutaneously and one week prior to sacrifice the same procedure was done with alizarin complexone ( 25  mg / kg ; sigma , usa ) . 
 the present study was authorized by competent national authorities and conducted accordingly to felasa 's guidelines for animal care . 
 both hind limbs were dissected , the implanted materials and surrounding tissue removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for two weeks . 
 bone samples were cut transversally to the long axis of the bone , each including a piezoelectric film and the surrounding bone ( figure 1(a ) ) . 
 soft tissues ( local lymph nodes and samples of the fibrous capsule surrounding the implants ) were routinely processed and embedded in paraffin . 
 undecalcified bone samples of each of the implants were included in resin ( technovit 9100 , heraeus kulzer , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and 80  m thick sections cut with a saw microtome ( leica 1600 , germany ) parallel to the piezoelectric film long axis 
 sections were then appropriately processed for routine staining ( giemsa eosin ) , mounted for fluorescence microscopy . 
 for histomorphometric studies , the interface between the bone and implant was divided in four distinct areas : z1 , z2 , z3 , and z4 , from cortical towards bone surrounding the free extremity of the piezoelectric film ( figure 1(b ) ) . 
 pictures were taken from the bone surrounding both sides of the film in areas z1 to z3 and z4 , using a 40x magnification ( figure 3 ) . 
 for immunohistochemistry and histochemistry , bone sections were decalcified in formic acid 5% for 3 weeks , dehydrated in ethanol , cleared in xylene , and embedded in paraffin wax and 3  m sections cut . 
 after deparaffinization and rehydration , immunohistochemistry sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes . 
 primary antibodies for tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) ( thermo scientific , usa , mouse monoclonal antibody , ab-1 , clone 26e5 , cat . 
 no.ms-1768 ) , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) ( neomarkers , usa , mouse monoclonal antibody , ab-1 , clone pc10 , cat . 
 no.rb-9097 ) were diluted to 1  :  20 , 1  :  200 , and 1  :  50 , respectively . 
 prior to immunostaining , the sections were pretreated for antigen retrieval at 100c in 10  mm citrate buffer , ph 6 , for 20 minutes in microwave oven , followed by cooling for 30 minutes at room temperature . for double staining of pcna and osteopontin , 
 immunohistochemistry was done using a double staining kit picture ( zymed laboratories inc , usa ) , according with the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 trap immunohystochemistry was performed with resource to kit picture - max polymer ( invitrogen , usa ) . 
 slides were counterstained with mayer 's hematoxilin , dehydrated , mounted with entellan ( merck , germany ) , and coverslipped . for all sections , 
 as negative controls adjacent sections were incubated : ( a ) without primary antibody and ( b ) with rabbit / rat normal serum ( similar concentration as that of primary ) . 
 masson trichrome was done using a kit ( bio - optica , italy ) , followed by dehydration and mounting . 
 observation and pictures were done using optic ( olympus bx41 ) and fluorescence microscope equipped with wb fluorescence cube ( olympus u - lh100hg ) . 
 total bone area , immature bone area , and mature bone area were measured using sigma scanpro 5 ( systat software inc . 
 the results , in percentage of total bone area , mature bone , and immature bone , were determined for each piezoelectric film in the pre - determined areas z1 to z4 . 
 normal distribution of the results was verified using the kolmogorov - smirnov test , homogeneity of variance assessed through the levene test , and differences between groups tested using one - way anova ( at a 0.05 level ) . 
 the statistical analysis was done using software originpro 8 ( originlab corporation , usa ) . 
 total bone area around the actuators was significantly higher , when comparing to static controls ( 39.91  14.08% versus 27.20  11.98% ) ( figure 4 ) . 
 the increment of bone occupied area was due to new bone formation , and in actuators the area occupied by woven bone and osteoid was 64.89  19.32% of the total bone area versus 31.72  14.54% in static devices ( figure 5 ) . 
 the chosen staining technique , giemsa eosin , stains older bone in a darker shade of pink , whilst more recently deposed bone is of a lighter pink color and frequently adjacent to much less prominent osteoid ( dark blue ) areas ( figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) ) . 
 taking into account the close relation in between osteoid and woven , recently formed bone , the authors chose not to make separated measurements that could be misleading . 
 the significant differences arise from the bone areas surrounding the two distal thirds of the devices ; around the devices ' clamped area , no differences were found between actuated and static devices ( figure 6 ) . 
 when assessing the mineral apposition rate in the distal third of the films , with the aid of the fluorochrome labeling , the mineral apposition rate was significantly higher around actuated devices ( 4.44  1.67  m / day ) than around static devices ( 2.70  0.95  m / day ) ( figure 5 ) . 
 a fibrous capsule was obvious both in actuators and static devices , with no statistical significant differences in capsule thickness between the two groups ( 289.59  131.20  m in actuated films versus 293.93  84.79  m ) . 
 immunohistochemistry failed to detect differences in trap expression between the two groups , but there is a marked elevation in opn detection around actuators , in z3 and z4 ( figure 7 ) . 
 opn is also strongly labeled in the fibroblast layers closer to the pvdf films , both in actuators and static controls , and this is the area where positive pcna labeling was found more often . 
 pcna labeling was also positive in some of the preosteoblastic cells in layers apposed to opn - positive columnar osteoblasts . 
 the existence of micro - movements at the interface , depending on the magnitude , may enhance osteogenesis or impair it and promote the formation of fibrous tissue [ 11 , 12 ] . considering the deformation levels of the actuator devices , under the experimental conditions , the generated strains were low , but the results suggest they are enough to elicit response . 
 mineral apposition rate and total bone mass are significantly higher around actuated films when compared to static controls , and these differences arise from around the areas of the films known to have higher displacement values . 
 the increased opn expression we found around actuators when comparing to static controls is most likely associated with mechanical stress , and it was not accompanied by a proportional increase in trap . 
 opn is a multifunctional noncollagenous glycoprotein present in bone matrix , expressed in various degrees by proliferating preosteoblasts , osteoblasts , and osteocytes but also by fibroblasts , osteoclasts , and macrophages [ 1315 ] . 
 opn production is known to be increased in association with mechanical loading [ 15 , 16 ] , and its deficiency significantly decreases bone fracture toughness , leading to heterogeneous mineral distribution , since opn is known to bind strongly to hydroxyapatite , and cell surface as well [ 17 , 18 ] . 
 we observed that all the devices were separated from neighboring bone by a fibrous capsule . 
 this is probably due to the material itself , since there were no differences between actuators and static controls . 
 it would be mandatory to develop and test a material with improved biocompatibility to evaluate accurately the bone material interface . 
 one other issue arises from reflecting upon the material and the coating properties and behavior . 
 the in vitro study previously developed shows evidence of adequate electric insulation for 48 hours in the experimental conditions . 
 however , the in vivo environment is not as controlled and , in addition to a longer period of time , the implantation procedure itself may induce damage on the coating . if coating damage occurs , one should consider the possible effects of the material ( pvdf and silver nitrate particles from the electrode ) and electrical current . 
 previous studies have shown cytotoxic silver nitrate activity , dependent on the concentration [ 19 , 20 ] . 
 the clinical advantages of applying electrical and electromagnetic fields in the treatment of fractures and mal - unions have been long known although the mechanisms leading to the clinical response are not well understood [ 2123 ] . 
 electric fields as low as 0.1  mv / cm promote osteoblast proliferation , with cell metabolic activity being influenced by the intensity of the electric field , and cell signaling based on the voltage - dependent calcium channels [ 24 , 25 ] . 
 electric and electromagnetic fields also exert effects on fibroblasts , enhancing proliferation , protein synthesis and influencing cell alignment , by calcium - independent mechanisms [ 2629 ] . 
 the fact that we found no significant differences in fibrous capsule thickness surrounding the devices suggests it is likely that the electric insulation remained satisfactory , but further studies would be needed to prove this . 
 however , if an electric field was being created locally , increased bone formation along the whole actuator could also be expected . 
 instead , new bone formation follows a pattern in accordance with what is known to be the areas of increased motion and deformation . 
 this study was performed in one animal only but using an adequate number of devices ( total of twelve ) . 
 the sheep was chosen as an animal model considering the bone biology similarities with the human species and the size of the devices . 
 the results are very clear in evidencing qualitative and quantitative statistically significant differences when comparing static and actuated films , but it would be necessary to enlarge the animal study and to study response with longer implantation times . 
 however , from an ethical point of view , it would be desirable to do so after developing a material other than pvdf , more biocompatible . 
 in conclusion , the present in vivo study suggests that in fact piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect may be used to effectively stimulate bone growth at the bone implant interface , eliciting an early response . 
 piezoelectric materials have the advantages of enabling a wide range of deformation / displacement , frequencies , and regimens . 
 therefore , they are excellent candidate components of actuators for clinical purposes . however , new materials should be developed , aiming better biocompatibility .","this in vivo study presents the preliminary results of the use of a novel piezoelectric actuator for orthopedic application . 
 the innovative use of the converse piezoelectric effect to mechanically stimulate bone was achieved with polyvinylidene fluoride actuators implanted in osteotomy cuts in sheep femur and tibia . 
 the biological response around the osteotomies was assessed through histology and histomorphometry in nondecalcified sections and histochemistry and immunohistochemistry in decalcified sections , namely , through masson 's trichrome , and labeling of osteopontin , proliferating cell nuclear antigen , and tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase . 
 after one - month implantation , total bone area and new bone area were significantly higher around actuators when compared to static controls . 
 bone deposition rate was also significantly higher in the mechanically stimulated areas . in these areas , osteopontin increased expression was observed . 
 the present in vivo study suggests that piezoelectric materials and the converse piezoelectric effect may be used to effectively stimulate bone growth .",pubmed

 epi : epididymal ; ing : inguinal . because lcn2-deficient mice gained more body weight and increased adiposity , particularly when mice were fed an hfd or aged , we examined food intake and energy expenditure in lcn2 mice . 
 an analysis of indirect calorimetry measurements showed that food intake , ambulatory activity , vo2 , and rq were not significantly different between rcd - fed wild - type and lcn2 mice at 18 weeks of age ( fig . 
 we then assessed thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue ( bat ) under thermoneutral and thermal stress conditions . 
 body temperature was measured in an ambient temperature of 28c and 22c as well as during acute exposure to 4c . 
 wild - type and lcn2 mice at 12 weeks of age exhibited a similar body temperature in an ambient temperature of 28c ( wild type , 38.34  0.34 ; lcn2 , 38.2  0.30 ) . 
 however , female lcn2 mice had a significantly lower rectal temperature than wild - type mice ( fig . 
 2a ) , while male lcn2 mice had a trend toward decrease in rectal temperature when kept in an ambient temperature of 22c . 
 more strikingly , lcn2 mice displayed cold sensitivity and could not survive when exposed to 4c for > 10 h. lcn2 mice ( seven of seven ) died after being exposed to 4c for 12 h , while all of the wild - type mice ( n = 7 ) in the experiment survived . 
 when acutely exposed to 4c , rectal temperature of lcn2 mice dropped significantly within 3 h compared with wild - type mice ( fig .

 we observed that upon hfd feeding , lcn2 mice expressed significantly lower levels of ucp-1 and peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor ( ppar )  coactivator ( pgc-1) genes in bat than wild - type mice mice ( fig . 
 however , ucp-1 and pgc-1 expression in bat were markedly stimulated at an even higher level in lcn2 mice , as wild - type mice after exposure to 4c for 5 h ( fig . 
 figure 2f showed that the protein expression levels of adipose triglyceride lipase ( atgl ) in white adipose tissue ( wat ) were slightly reduced in lcn2 mice under the hfd and cold condition compared with wild - type mice . however , cold - induced hsl gene expression in bat and wat was completely diminished in lcn2 mice ( fig . 
 lastly , we investigated the mitochondrial oxidative capacity of bat , as this function of bat is critical for providing the energy for thermogenesis . 
 interestingly , we observed that there was a significant reduction in the expression levels of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function , such as nuclear respiratory factor ( nrf)1 , transcription factor a , mitochondrial ( tfam ) , atp synthase 5 ( atp5 ) , cytochrome c oxidase ( cox ) 4 , and carnitine palmitoyltransferase ( cpt)-1 in bat of lcn2 mice fed an hfd ( fig . 
 in addition , the expression of transcription factors ppar , nrf1 and tfam , and cpt-1 gene in skeletal muscle was also significantly downregulated in lcn2 mice fed an hfd ( fig . 
 2d ) . to assess the effects of lcn2 deficiency on systemic insulin sensitivity , gtts and itts were performed . 
 glucose clearance curves in response to glucose administration were significantly increased in hfd - fed ( fig . 
 3b ) , indicating that lcn2 mice are more glucose intolerant upon hfd feeding . in the itt , 
 increased insulin - stimulated glucose disposal curve was observed in lcn2 mice , indicating that lcn2 mice are more insulin resistant than wild - type controls when fed an hfd ( fig . 
 3d ) . analysis of serum metabolic parameters , as shown in table 1 , demonstrated that levels of fasting serum glucose and insulin were significantly elevated , while adiponectin levels were reduced in hfd - fed lcn2 mice when compared with wild - type controls . 
 serum levels of leptin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were not significantly changed in lcn2 mice on an rcd , although serum leptin levels had a trend toward a decrease in hfd - fed lcn2 mice . 
 after adjustment to body weight , the serum levels of glucose , insulin , and adiponectin were consistently different at the statistically significant level , indicating that the changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after hfd in lcn2 mice is not simply due to body weight effects . to further confirm that lcn2 mice have decreased insulin sensitivity , in vivo insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylation was evaluated . 
 wild - type and lcn2 mice on rcd were injected intraperitoneally with insulin , killed after 10 min , and tissues were collected for evaluation of akt phosohorylation . 
 consistently , insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylation in liver , muscle , and adipose cells was significantly reduced in lcn2 mice as compared with wild - type mice ( fig . 
 the examination of lcn2 effect on upstream signaling components of insulin signaling pathway demonstrated that the expression levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 protein were markedly reduced in wat of lcn2 mice on an hfd compared with wild - type mice ( fig . 
 this data further support that lcn2 mice developed more insulin resistance and lcn2 regulates insulin signaling activity likely at the upstream level .

 the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokine tnf and monocyte chemoattractant protein ( mcp)-1 were upregulated , while expression of arginase 1 , an anti - inflammatory marker , was downregulated in adipose tissue of hfd - fed lcn2 mice compared with wild - type control mice ( fig .

 * p < 0.05 . to investigate whether increased liver weight in lcn2 mice is associated with the development of fatty liver and dyslipidemia , liver triglyceride content and blood lipid profiles were measured . in comparison with wild - type controls , hfd - fed and 
 aged lcn2 mice demonstrated a significant increase in lipid accumulation as detected by oil - red o staining of the liver section ( fig . 
 the development of more severe fatty liver disease , together with elevated fasting blood glucose levels , suggests hepatic insulin resistance in lcn2 mice . 
 to elucidate hepatic glucose production in wild - type and lcn2-deficient mice fed an hfd , mice were fasted for 18 h and gene expression of two key gluconeogenic enzymes pepck and glucose-6-phosphatase ( g6pase ) were detected by quantitative pcr . 
 6c , expression levels of pepck1 , pepck2 , and g6pase genes were significantly higher in the liver of lcn2 mice than that in wild - type controls , suggesting that increased hepatic glucose production is attributed to hyperglycemia in lcn2 mice . 
 we next examined the hepatic capabilities for fatty acid synthesis and oxidation to explore the possible mechanism for the development of fatty liver in lcn2 mice . 
 6d , the lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element - binding protein-1c ( srebp-1c ) , acetyl - coa carboxylase 1 ( acc1 ) , spot 14 ( s14 ) , and scd-1 were expressed at a significantly higher level in hfd - fed lcn2 mice compared with wild - type controls , while genes involved in fatty acid oxidation such as ppar , cpt-1 , and acetyl - coa carboxylase 2 were similarly expressed between genotypes ( data not shown ) . therefore , the development of fatty liver results primarily from the increased capability for fatty acid synthesis in the liver in lcn2 mice .

 ( a high - quality digital color representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) 
 compared with wild - type mice , lcn2 mice on an rcd had significantly higher serum levels of triglycerides , cholesterol , and free fatty acids . 
 the hfd feeding did not induce a further increase in serum levels of triglyceride and cholesterol but significantly augmented the levels of ldl and -hydroxybutyrate in lcn2 mice compared with wild - type controls . 
 the above data have suggested that lcn2-deficient mice became more insulin resistant upon hfd feeding and age . 
 since adipose tissue is a key site for insulin - regulated glucose / lipid metabolism and glucose disposal , we examined the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in primary adipose cells isolated from lcn2 mice . 
 compared with wild - type adipose cells , expression levels of genes involved lipid metabolism and adipokines , including ppar , lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) , glut4 , adiponectin , and leptin were markedly reduced in adipose tissue of hfd - fed lcn2 mice ( online appendix fig .

 because lcn2-deficient mice gained more body weight and increased adiposity , particularly when mice were fed an hfd or aged , we examined food intake and energy expenditure in lcn2 mice . 
 an analysis of indirect calorimetry measurements showed that food intake , ambulatory activity , vo2 , and rq were not significantly different between rcd - fed wild - type and lcn2 mice at 18 weeks of age ( fig .

 body temperature was measured in an ambient temperature of 28c and 22c as well as during acute exposure to 4c .

 however , ucp-1 and pgc-1 expression in bat were markedly stimulated at an even higher level in lcn2 mice , as wild - type mice after exposure to 4c for 5 h ( fig . 
 figure 2f showed that the protein expression levels of adipose triglyceride lipase ( atgl ) in white adipose tissue ( wat ) were slightly reduced in lcn2 mice under the hfd and cold condition compared with wild - type mice .

 lastly , we investigated the mitochondrial oxidative capacity of bat , as this function of bat is critical for providing the energy for thermogenesis . interestingly 
 , we observed that there was a significant reduction in the expression levels of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function , such as nuclear respiratory factor ( nrf)1 , transcription factor a , mitochondrial ( tfam ) , atp synthase 5 ( atp5 ) , cytochrome c oxidase ( cox ) 4 , and carnitine palmitoyltransferase ( cpt)-1 in bat of lcn2 mice fed an hfd ( fig .

 increased insulin - stimulated glucose disposal curve was observed in lcn2 mice , indicating that lcn2 mice are more insulin resistant than wild - type controls when fed an hfd ( fig . 
 3d ) . analysis of serum metabolic parameters , as shown in table 1 , demonstrated that levels of fasting serum glucose and insulin were significantly elevated , while adiponectin levels were reduced in hfd - fed lcn2 mice when compared with wild - type controls . 
 serum levels of leptin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were not significantly changed in lcn2 mice on an rcd , although serum leptin levels had a trend toward a decrease in hfd - fed lcn2 mice . 
 after adjustment to body weight , the serum levels of glucose , insulin , and adiponectin were consistently different at the statistically significant level , indicating that the changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after hfd in lcn2 mice is not simply due to body weight effects . to further confirm that lcn2 mice have decreased insulin sensitivity , in vivo insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylation was evaluated . 
 wild - type and lcn2 mice on rcd were injected intraperitoneally with insulin , killed after 10 min , and tissues were collected for evaluation of akt phosohorylation . 
 consistently , insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylation in liver , muscle , and adipose cells was significantly reduced in lcn2 mice as compared with wild - type mice ( fig . 
 the examination of lcn2 effect on upstream signaling components of insulin signaling pathway demonstrated that the expression levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 protein were markedly reduced in wat of lcn2 mice on an hfd compared with wild - type mice ( fig . 
 this data further support that lcn2 mice developed more insulin resistance and lcn2 regulates insulin signaling activity likely at the upstream level .

 was examined in adipose tissue and liver of hfd - induced wild - type and lcn2 mice . 
 5b ) . furthermore , the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokine tnf and monocyte chemoattractant protein ( mcp)-1 were upregulated , while expression of arginase 1 , an anti - inflammatory marker , was downregulated in adipose tissue of hfd - fed lcn2 mice compared with wild - type control mice ( fig .

 to investigate whether increased liver weight in lcn2 mice is associated with the development of fatty liver and dyslipidemia , liver triglyceride content and blood lipid profiles were measured . in comparison with wild - type controls , hfd - fed and 
 aged lcn2 mice demonstrated a significant increase in lipid accumulation as detected by oil - red o staining of the liver section ( fig . 
 the development of more severe fatty liver disease , together with elevated fasting blood glucose levels , suggests hepatic insulin resistance in lcn2 mice . to elucidate hepatic glucose production in wild - type and 
 lcn2-deficient mice fed an hfd , mice were fasted for 18 h and gene expression of two key gluconeogenic enzymes pepck and glucose-6-phosphatase ( g6pase ) were detected by quantitative pcr . as illustrated in fig . 
 6c , expression levels of pepck1 , pepck2 , and g6pase genes were significantly higher in the liver of lcn2 mice than that in wild - type controls , suggesting that increased hepatic glucose production is attributed to hyperglycemia in lcn2 mice . 
 we next examined the hepatic capabilities for fatty acid synthesis and oxidation to explore the possible mechanism for the development of fatty liver in lcn2 mice . 
 6d , the lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element - binding protein-1c ( srebp-1c ) , acetyl - coa carboxylase 1 ( acc1 ) , spot 14 ( s14 ) , and scd-1 were expressed at a significantly higher level in hfd - fed lcn2 mice compared with wild - type controls , while genes involved in fatty acid oxidation such as ppar , cpt-1 , and acetyl - coa carboxylase 2 were similarly expressed between genotypes ( data not shown ) . 
 therefore , the development of fatty liver results primarily from the increased capability for fatty acid synthesis in the liver in lcn2 mice .

 ( a high - quality digital color representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) 
 compared with wild - type mice , lcn2 mice on an rcd had significantly higher serum levels of triglycerides , cholesterol , and free fatty acids . 
 the hfd feeding did not induce a further increase in serum levels of triglyceride and cholesterol but significantly augmented the levels of ldl and -hydroxybutyrate in lcn2 mice compared with wild - type controls . 
 the above data have suggested that lcn2-deficient mice became more insulin resistant upon hfd feeding and age . since adipose tissue is a key site for insulin - regulated glucose / lipid metabolism and glucose disposal , we examined the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in primary adipose cells isolated from lcn2 mice . compared with wild - type adipose cells , expression levels of genes involved lipid metabolism and adipokines , including ppar , lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) , glut4 , adiponectin , and leptin were markedly reduced in adipose tissue of hfd - fed lcn2 mice ( online appendix fig

 we show here that lcn2 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism , adaptive thermoregulation , and diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance in vivo . 
 lack of lcn2 in mice potentiates hfd - induced obesity , dyslipidemia , fatty liver , glucose intolerance , and insulin resistance . 
 we also discovered that lcn2 is a critical regulator of adaptive thermogenesis and mitochondrial oxidative function in bat . 
 lcn2 deficiency impairs adaptive thermogenesis and increases the susceptibility of lcn2 mice to hfd - induced obesity . 
 our data demonstrated that lcn2 mice gained more body weight when they were fed hfd or aged . increased body fat mass together with enlarged multiple organs 
 in particular , increased organ weights may largely account for increased body weight in lcn2 mice under the rcd condition . 
 in general , wild - type and lcn2 mice at a young age did not demonstrate significantly different metabolic phenotypes when they were fed rcd . however , lcn2 mice developed more severe systemic insulin resistance , hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , and hypoadiponectinemia under the hfd condition 
 . one of the most profound phenotypic features of lcn2 mice is cold sensitivity and lower body temperature under thermal stress conditions . 
 it has been known for a long time that nonshivering thermogenesis is used to maintain constant body temperature and energy balance , controlling body weight , especially in small mammals ( 1719 ) . 
 both neural and hormonal signals , including norepinephrine , epinephrine , thyroid hormones , glucagon , insulin , glucocorticoid , and leptin , are known to regulate thermogenesis ( 17,20 ) through different thermogenic mechanisms involving stimulating atp utilization , increasing ucp-1mediated proton leak and heat production and affecting substrate availability and utilization for energy production . in rodents , 
 bat is the main tissue that is responsible for sympathetic nervous system  regulated nonshivering themogenesis with the involvement of norepinephrine and epinephrine ( 17,20,21 ) . ucp-1 and pgc-1 are the key genes that mediate sympathetic thermogenic responses in bat . 
 for example , ucp-1 gene expression in bat of ob / ob mice was reduced ( 23 ) . however 
 , bat ucp-1 expression could be normally stimulated in response to cold environment in young ob / ob mice , albeit ob / ob mice show decreased capability of utilizing fat and cold intolerance ( 23 ) . in this study 
 , we found that 5-h cold exposure leads to a significant increase in lcn2 expression in wat , which is in agreement with the result in a recent study ( 24 ) . in the absence of lcn2 , mice were cold intolerant and failed to maintain the body temperature when acutely exposed to cold temperature . interestingly , cold exposure could still significantly stimulate gene expression of ucp-1 and pgc-1 in bat in lcn2 mice , suggesting that cold - induced sympathetic thermogenesis remained intact in the absence of lcn2 . 
 the role of leptin in thermogenesis has been well documented , and its thermogenic effect is considered to be primarily central ( 25 ) . 
 for example , leptin administration has been reported to rescue cold - induced hypothermia in the absence of ucp-1 in leptin and ucp-1 double knockout mice ( 26,27 ) , while the opposite results were perceived in the other two independent studies ( 28,29 ) . in lcn2 mice on rcd , 
 serum leptin levels were not different from that in wild - type mice , albeit serum leptin levels had a trend toward decreased in lcn2 mice in response to hfd feeding . 
 additionally , wild - type and lcn2 mice on an rcd did not exhibit a difference in body temperature in thermoneutral conditions . 
 therefore , it seems rather unlikely that leptin could be the major contributor to cold intolerance in lcn2 mice ; leptin may be only partially involved in lcn2-regulated thermogenesis . 
 in addition to hormonal signals , defects in key metabolic regulators of substrate availability for energy production , atp synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function could all possibly affect thermogenic function . 
 indeed , studies in mice with the genetic disruption of key metabolic regulators have proved this assumption ; mice without expressing atgl could similarly result in cold intolerance ( 30 ) . in the present study 
 , the disruption of lcn2 completely diminished cold - induced hsl gene expression in bat and wat , whereas atgl expression in wat was only slightly affected in lcn2 mice under both the hfd and cold conditions . 
 since hsl mice are not cold sensitive ( 31 ) , hsl is not an important regulator for adaptive thermogenesis . 
 therefore , the effect of changes in atgl levels on the supply of substrates for energy production for thermogenesis is minimal in lcn2 mice . on the other hand 
 , the production of the energy necessary for thermogenesis requires normal mitochondrial oxidative function , and mitochondrial dysfunction could have a significant impact on adaptive thermogenesis . 
 this hypothesis has been supported by a previous study in estrogen - related receptor  ( eer ) knockout mice . in eer-deficient mice , mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function in bat 
 was disturbed , and mice failed to maintain body temperature when exposed to cold ( 32 ) . to this end 
 interestingly , we found that the expression levels of mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function such as nrf1 , tfam , atp5b , cox 4 , and cpt-1 were significantly reduced in bat of lcn2 mice fed an hfd . in the skeletal muscle , the expression of -oxidation genes ppar and cpt-1 , as well as mitochondrial genes nrf1 and tfam , were also downregulated in hfd - fed lcn2 mice . 
 all the above data together suggest that mitochondrial metabolism is dysfunctional in bat and muscle of lcn2 mice , which mainly contributes to decreased thermogenic capacity , decreased energy expenditure , and the high susceptibility to diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance during the thermal stress conditions ( mice have been living at 22c ) . in acute cold , 
 muscle - shivering thermogenesis is considered to be the primary mechanism for a body temperature defense ( 21,33,34 ) . 
 bat nonshivering thermogenesis participates in combating the cold temperature only when the extra capacity is already recruited for using during the acute cold exposure ( 35 ) . therefore , cold intolerance ( acute exposure to 4c for 5 h ) in lcn2 mice may largely result from decreased oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle and bat as well as decreased atgl expression in wat . 
 our results clearly demonstrated that insulin responsiveness in muscle , adipose tissue , and liver was reduced , indicating systemic insulin resistance in lcn2 mice . 
 furthermore , fasting for 18 h induces significantly higher levels of expression for pepck and g6pase in the liver of hfd - fed lcn2 mice , supporting that the increased hepatic glucose production is an important contributor to fasting hyperglycemia in lcn2 mice . 
 this phenomenon is likely due to the impaired regulation of lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and liver in lcn2 mice . 
 we showed that lcn2 mice on an rcd had higher serum levels of triglycerides but lower serum triglyceride levels when fed an hfd as compared with wild - type mice . 
 lower serum triglycerides in hfd - fed lcn2 mice could be due to the increased triglycerides synthesis and decreased vldl ( or triglyceride ) secretion into the circulation resulting from the development of fatty liver in lcn2 mice . 
 this explanation is strengthened by a previous study ( 36 ) in lirko ( insulin receptor knockout ) mice with hepatic insulin resistance and 50% decrease in serum triglyceride levels . as reported in our previous in vitro study ( 6 ) , lcn2 is capable of suppressing inflammatory response of macrophages to lps stimulation . 
 we speculated that lcn2 possesses anti - inflammatory role in metabolic regulation . in this in vivo study , we show that lcn2 expression is downregulated in adipose tissue and bone marrow macrophages ( bm - mac ) in hfd - induced obese mice . in the absence of lcn2 , 
 the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as mcp-1 and tnf are upregulated in adipose tissue , while expression levels of anti - inflammatory markers arginase 1 and il-10 are decreased in adipose tissue and liver , suggesting an increased inflammatory state in lcn2 mice . 
 these results further suggest that lcn2 mice are more susceptible to hfd - induced proinflammatory response than wild - type mice . in summary , herein we discovered a novel role for lcn2 in energy metabolism , adaptive thermogenesis , and insulin resistance . 
 mice lacking lcn2 display impaired adaptive thermogenesis and deteriorated diet - induced obesity and insulin resistance . 
 decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity in bat and skeletal muscle may be the primary mechanisms for the development of diet - induced insulin resistance and cold sensitive in lcn2 mice . 
 however , the mechanisms for how lcn2 regulates mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism remain to be further identified . 
 it is likely that the binding of lcn2 to small hydrophobic molecules such as retinoic acids , fatty acids , and other unknown ligands or to the cell surface receptor such as megalin or ldl - related protein 2 ( 37 ) could potentially involve or mediate lcn2 effects in metabolism . 
 our findings provide new insight into the role of lcn2 in lipid metabolism and metabolic homeostasis . in this manner 
 , lcn2 may be a potential therapeutic target for controlling obesity - associated type 2 diabetes and metabolic complications . 
 ","objectivelipocalin ( lcn ) 2 belongs to the lipocalin subfamily of low  molecular mass  secreted proteins that bind small hydrophobic molecules . 
 lcn2 has been recently characterized as an adipose - derived cytokine , and its expression is upregulated in adipose tissue in genetically obese rodents . 
 the objective of this study was to investigate the role of lcn2 in diet - induced insulin resistance and metabolic homeostasis in vivo.research design and methodssystemic insulin sensitivity , adaptive thermogenesis , and serum metabolic and lipid profile were assessed in lcn2-deficient mice fed a high - fat diet ( hfd ) or regular chow diet.resultsthe molecular disruption of lcn2 in mice resulted in significantly potentiated diet - induced obesity , dyslipidemia , fatty liver disease , and insulin resistance . 
 lcn2/ mice exhibit impaired adaptive thermogenesis and cold intolerance . 
 gene expression patterns in white and brown adipose tissue , liver , and muscle indicate that lcn2/ mice have increased hepatic gluconeogenesis , decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity , impaired lipid metabolism , and increased inflammatory state under the hfd condition.conclusionslcn2 has a novel role in adaptive thermoregulation and diet - induced insulin resistance .",pubmed
"tubularized incised plate ( tip ) repair is recommended as the ideal repair for distal penile hypospadias ; it has shown excellent results in the management of primary , redo , distal , and proximal hypospadias . 
 a number of groups have recently been engaged in studying the plate characters and its impact on the success of tip . 
 while some authors have shown the importance of the plate characters in the success of tip repair , others have shown that the technique could be used for all cases of hypospadias without concern for the plate configurations . 
 these previous studies have inspired us to undertake the current study to examine the role of the plate character in the success of tip repair among the study population in yemen . 
 here , we present a study evaluating the urethral plate characters , such as shape and the width in the success of tip urethroplasty for the management of primary anterior penile hypospadias in 100 children . 
 between january 2010 and december 2013 , a total of 100 children with primary anterior penile hypospadias were undergone tip repair . 
 all cases were undergone in mayo hospital , hodiedah , yemen . we used snodgrass technique with modifications for our current study . 
 all children were examined under general anesthesia ; the type of the plate is defined and reported by a single surgeon . 
 the plates were measured at the widest area ( in mm ) at the time of surgery . 
 we divided the study population according to the width of urethral plate > 8 mm ( group - a ) , while patients with urethral plate < 8 mm ( group - b ) . following the classification made by nguyen et al . 
 , the plates were categorized as flat , cleft , and deeply grooved [ figures 13 ] . 
 in addition , examination of the penis was also carried out to evaluate the presence or absence of chordee . 
 first a u - shaped incision was made around the plate associated with circumferential incision for complete degloving of the penis . 
 an artificial erection was achieved by saline injection , and the intrinsic ventral curvature was corrected with a dorsal plication if needed . 
 one deep midline incision in the urethral plate was made from the tip of the penis to the urethral meatus as described by snodgrass . 
 the plate was tubularized around 6 or 8 french ( fr ) nelaton catheter using polyglycolic acid 6/0 subcuticular running suture . 
 glanuloplasty was performed in a standard manner with interrupted 6 - 0 monofilament polyglyconate synthetic absorbable sutures . 
 postoperative urethral feeding tube or silicone foley catheter 8 fr was used for urinary drainage for average 1 week . 
 intraoperative single dose antibiotic was used ( ampicillin / gentamycin weight - adjusted dose in all cases ) . 
 postoperative management included ampicillin / gentamycin weight - adjusted dose in all cases and oxybutynin for relieving bladder spasms . 
 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs , oral or suppository , were used in weight - adjusted doses . 
 success of surgery and postoperative complications were assessed in patients categorized on the basis of the shape of the plate or its width . 
 postoperatively , patients were followed - up for evaluating meatal stenosis , fistula formation , and partial or complete glandular dehiscence at the 1 , 3 and 6 months . 
 patients were followed - up for urethral calibration by urethral sound 8 fr at the third and 6 months of follow - up . 
 the flow rate was selectively indicated for patients with voiding difficulty and/or a narrow meatal orifice or weak stream . 
 a meatal stenosis was diagnosed when the flow rate was < 5 ml / s . 
 success was defined as the presence of an anatomically positioned vertical slit - like meatus , a normal urinary stream , and a satisfactory cosmetic appearance resembling a circumcised penis . 
 data were statistically analysed using epi info program ( centers for disease control and prevention , atlanta , georgia , usa ) . 
 fischer exact test for 2  2 tables was performed when expected cell count in > 25% of cases was < 5 . 
 first a u - shaped incision was made around the plate associated with circumferential incision for complete degloving of the penis . 
 an artificial erection was achieved by saline injection , and the intrinsic ventral curvature was corrected with a dorsal plication if needed . 
 one deep midline incision in the urethral plate was made from the tip of the penis to the urethral meatus as described by snodgrass . 
 the plate was tubularized around 6 or 8 french ( fr ) nelaton catheter using polyglycolic acid 6/0 subcuticular running suture .

 success was defined as the presence of an anatomically positioned vertical slit - like meatus , a normal urinary stream , and a satisfactory cosmetic appearance resembling a circumcised penis . 
 data were statistically analysed using epi info program ( centers for disease control and prevention , atlanta , georgia , usa ) . 
 fischer exact test for 2  2 tables was performed when expected cell count in > 25% of cases was < 5 . 
 mean age of the patients underwent surgery was 4.3 years , ranging between 9 months and 12 years . 
 mean operative time was 115 min ( ranging 70 - 140 min ) and the average period of hospital stay was 4.6 days ( ranging 1 - 15 days ) . 
 urethral stenting for urine diversion was used for an average 7.7 days ( ranging 3 - 14 days ) , and the patients were followed - up for an average period of 6.4 months ( ranging 2 - 24 months ) . 
 we found mild insignificant chordee in 15 cases , improved after complete degloving of the penile skin without any additional procedures . 
 five infants had subcoronal hypospadias along with unilateral undescended testes ; these infants underwent orchiopexy at the same time along with hypospadias surgery . 
 location of the meatus was reported as coronal in 46 , subcoronal in 50 and anterior penile in 4 patients . 
 we divided the study population according to the width of urethral plate as 74 cases ( 74% ) with urethral plate > 8 mm ( group - a ) , whereas 26 cases ( 26% ) with urethral plate < 8 mm ( group - b ) . 
 table 1 shows that group - b patients with urethral plate < 8 mm had a statistically significant higher fistula rate compared with the group - a patients with urethral plate > 8 mm ( p = 0.004 ) . 
 similarly , group - b patients also had significantly higher incidences of failed 8 fr calibration compared with group - a ( p = 0.01 ) [ table 1 ] . 
 complications correlated to urethral plate width we also divided our study population ( 100 patients ) according to the character of urethral plate as flat ( 26 patients ) , cleft ( 52 patients ) , and deeply grooved ( 22 patients ) and monitored for postoperative complications . 
 table 2 shows that higher fistula rate as well as failed 8 fr calibrations is associated with patients having flat urethral plate compared with the patients with either cleft or deeply grooved urethral plates , although not statistically significant . 
 irrespective of urethral plate character , overall 8% patients developed fistula , 12% patients had failed 8 fr calibration , while partial dehiscence occurred in 1 case ( 1% ) . in addition , redo surgery was also indicated in 1 patient and fistulectomy in 8 patients . 
 the aim of hypospadias surgery is the creation of a straight penis with slit - like meatus at the tip of a glans with enough skin coverage . 
 tip urethroplasty is the most common procedure used for hypospadias repair since its introduction in 1994 by snodgrass . 
 tip repair is versatile and can be used for creation for neourethra with satisfactory slit - like meatus . the urethral plate shape and width 
 are generally evaluated when the tip repair is opted for the management of hypospadias . in this study 
 , we also categorised our study population based on both urethral plate width and shape . 
 based on the plate width , patients were divided into group - a with width > 8 mm and group - b < 8 mm . 
 we found significantly higher incidences of fistula in group - b patients when compared to the group - a patients ( p = 0.004 ) . 
 ideal urethral plate allows the creation of the neourethra > 10 fr in children after a midline incision to widen the urethral plate . 
 however , a narrow plate < 8 mm is inadequate for the creation of neourethra , which might be the cause of the statistically significant higher fistula rate in group - b patients with urethral plate width < 8 mm . 
 our findings are in accordance with the earlier reports by both holland and smith and nguyen et al . where statistically significant higher fistula was found in patients with urethral plate < 8 mm width 
 however , nguyen et al . reported 1 case ( 3.3% ) over 30 cases with narrow urethral plate versus one case ( 0.7% ) over 129 cases with urethral plate > 8 mm ; therefore , the result was statistically insignificant 
 . the higher fistula rate with narrow urethral plate occurs because of the fact that midline incision of the urethral plate is not enough to create a neourethra with too much width around 8 fr catheter ; as a consequence , the urethral plate makes the anastomoses under tension . 
 therefore , tubularisation with tension on suture line increases the incidence of fistula formation in cases with narrow urethral plate . 
 failure in 8 fr calibration in association with fistula formation could be resolved with urethral dilation . in our study , two of the children who had fistula resolved with urethral dilation . 
 modification to midline incision of the plate by extending it beyond to the tip of glans prevents meatal stenosis as described by khairallah and bader - eldin ; however , it only decreases fistula rate and meatal stenosis to < 1% . 
 we also divided our study population based on the urethral plate character as flat , cleft , and deeply grooved . 
 a higher fistula rate was noted in patients with flat urethral plate compared to the patients with cleft or deeply grooved ; however , the result is not statistically significant ( p = 0.4 ) . 
 this is also in agreement with the previous reports , where no significant relation was found between urethral plate depth and incidence of fistula . 
 although higher failed 8 fr calibration rate was observed in patients with flat urethral plate compared with the other two groups cleft and deeply grooved , the result is statistically insignificant ( p = 0.09 ) [ table 2 ] . 
 similar to earlier reports , our study also provide evidences of excellent outcome in hypospadias management through tip repair with overall 8% patients developing fistula , 12% patients with failed 8 fr calibration , while partial dehiscence occurred in 1 case ( 1% ) ; redo surgery was indicated in only 1 patient . in the current study , we found patients with flat and narrow urethral plate developed more complications . in this 
 regard , tavakkoli tabassi and mohammadi rana advocated the use of buccal mucosal graft ( bmg ) with tip repair to augment the narrow urethral plate ( 6 - 8 mm ) and they concluded that the use of mucosal graft decreased fistula rate formation and meatal stenosis . 
 ye et al . also combined tip with bmg in 53 patients and found better outcome . 
 therefore , urethral plate augmentation is recommended when the urethral plate is narrow and inelastic requiring augmentation with free graft . 
 based on our findings , we conclude that the tip urethroplasty has good cosmetic and functional results and offer a modality for hypospadias repair that has the following advantages : preservation and utilisation of urethral plate without the need for additional flaps , single suture line of the neourethra , creation of glandular and penile urethra , short operative time and low complication rate . 
 this technique can be used for primary anterior penile hypospadias with satisfactory results . using this technique with plates 
 flat plates may need augmentation by bmg as advised by some authors to improve the results in this group of patients .","background : today , tubularized incised plate ( tip ) urethroplasty is the most commonly performed operation for distal and mid - penile hypospadias . 
 reports from different centers worldwide confirm its nearly universal applicability and low complications rate.aim:evaluation of the urethral plate characters and its effect on the outcome of tip urethroplasty.materials and methods : between 2010 and 2013 , 100 children with primary distal penile hypospadias underwent tip urethroplasty . 
 urethral plates were categorized as flat , cleft , and deeply grooved . 
 postoperatively , patients were followed - up for evaluation of meatal stenosis , fistula formation , and glandular dehiscence at 1st , 3rd and 6th months . 
 patients were followed - up for urethral calibration by urethral sound 8 fr at 3rd and 6 months follow - up . 
 data were statistically analysed using epi info program to correlate between the width , plate shape , and complications.results:mean age at surgery was 4.3 years . 
 patients were followed - up for an average period of 6.4 months . 
 pre - operative location of the meatus was reported as coronal in 46 , subcoronal in 50 and anterior penile in 4 cases . 
 urethral plate characters were flat in 26 cases , cleft in 52 , and deeply grooved in 22 . 
 urethral plate width was > 8 mm in 74 cases and < 8 mm in 26 . 
 patients with urethral plate < 8 mm had a statistically significant higher fistula rate ( p = 0.004 ) and failed 8 fr calibrations in 26.9% ( p = 0.01 ) compared with the patients with urethral plate > 8 mm . in addition , we also founds higher fistula rate and failed 8 fr calibrations in flat urethral plate.conclusions:an adequate urethral plate width ( > 8 mm ) is essential for successful tip repair . 
 lower success rates with flat plates may need buccal mucosal augmentation to improve the results .",pubmed
"trichomonas vaginalis   infection is one of the most common curable sexually transmitted infections . who estimates that 173 million of new cases occur annually . 
 trichomonal infection has been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes including pelvic inflammatory disease , low infant birth weight and premature delivery [ 36 ] . 
 furthermore , trichomoniasis has been shown to increase transmission and acquisition of other sexually transmitted diseases , including hiv infection [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] . 
 the frequency of trichomonal infection is not monitored in most countries nor do control programs exist . 
 peruvian sti guidelines do not include trichomonas diagnostic testing ; the syndromic management of suspected vaginal trichomoniasis is the current standard for clinical care . 
 trichomonal infection is most likely more common among women and men than is generally understood , and long standing , asymptomatic infections may lead to continued community level transmission . as trichomonas prevalence depends on many factors such as age , sexual activity , and 
 the number of sex partners , a better understanding of the epidemiology of this infection in women is needed to foster disease control programs in populations at risk for reproductive health complications . 
 this study was a cross - sectional analysis of the behavioral and biological data from the baseline assessment of a cohort subsequently enrolled in the nimh collaborative hiv / std prevention trial collected from 2003 to 2005 in peru . 
 we enrolled participants from low - income neighborhoods in three coastal peruvian cities : lima , trujillo , and chiclayo . 
 we chose neighborhoods based on data from the peruvian national institute of statistics and informatics . 
 socially marginalized women were characterized through informal interviews and participant observation , and based on ethnographic information collected prior to the study baseliness were shown to have high levels of sexual risk behaviors . we defined socially marginalized women   as those women living in low - income neighborhoods  who contradicted peruvian social norms by spending time with and having sex with poor unemployed men . 
 most of these women were also unemployed , and although the majority reported a stable sex partner , most of them also reported having multiple sex partners , further defying the social norms of peru . 
 eligible women were recruited by outreach workers from venues such as volleyball fields , hair salons , parks , bars , and street corners . 
 the number of venues selected per city was approximately proportional to the city 's overall population . 
 eligible participants were restricted to women between 18 and 40 years of age who reported having had sex in the past six months , intended to stay in the neighborhood for at least two years , and who frequented the target venue at least twice a week . 
 participants were invited to a temporary project office in their neighborhood , where we privately administered a 30-minute structured survey in spanish , wherein trained interviewers read questions to participants and entered their answers into a portable computer . 
 the survey instrument collected sociodemographic information as well as detailed sexual risk behavior with the last five sex partners , number of sex partners , sti - related symptoms , alcohol and drug , use and hiv status . upon completing the survey , participants underwent pretest counseling for stis including hiv infection , conducted by a trained counselor . trained laboratory technicians then explained to each participant how to self - collect a vaginal specimen using a dacron swab . 
 a second dacron swab was stored for chlamydia trachomatis   and neisseria gonorrhoeae pcr testing ( ct / ng amplicor pcr , roche diagnostics , nj , usa ) , and a blood sample was also collected for hiv-1 ( genetic systems bio - rad laboratories , hercules , calif , usa ) , herpes virus simplex type 2 antibodies ( herpeselect ; focus technologies , cypress , calif , usa ) , and syphilis testing ( rprnosticon , shield diagnostics , dundee , uk and serodia - tppa , fujirebio diagnostics inc , tokyo , japan ) . participants returning for results underwent posttest counseling to ensure their understanding of the meaning of both positive and negative results and for treatment in case of a positive result . 
 treatment for trichomoniasis consisted of 2 g , single dose metronidazole by mouth administered by trained health personnel . 
 all participants with positive results were encouraged to share test results with recent sex partners . 
 reimbursement for travel costs and time spent during the assessment was given to each participant at the rate of 15 peruvian soles ( approximately $ 5 ) at their first visit and an additional 10 peruvian soles ( approximately $ 3 ) at their posttest visit . 
 all vaginal swab specimens were immediately inoculated and transported at ambient temperature using the in pouch tv culture media ( biomed diagnostics , white city , ore , usa ) to the cayetano heredia university  sexual health laboratory in lima , chiclayo , or trujillo . 
 cultures were transported to the laboratory within 68 hours after sample collection and incubated at 37c once they arrived at the laboratory . to monitor the performance of test and as part of the quality control of the study , 
 known positive samples were inoculated in the field , transported , and cultured under the same conditions . 
 all samples , including the controls , were observed microscopically at 400x power for the presence of motile , oval flagellated protozoan daily for 5 days . 
 the observation of motile trichomonads was reported as positive , and specimens showing no organisms after 5 days of incubation were considered negative for t. vaginalis . 
 laboratory work was performed in accordance with the college of american pathology quality assurance and quality control program . 
 as odds ratios overestimate the estimated risk when the prevalence is high , we calculated prevalence ratios to avoid that bias . to model the prevalence ratios we used poisson family generalized linear models and adjusted the standard errors to account for the clustered nature of sample . 
 multivariate models were created taking into account all variables that were significant at p - value < .1 in bivariate analysis . 
 the variables added to the multivariate model were selected based on likelihood ratio tests comparing nested to saturated models and included only if the likelihood ratio test had a p - value   < .05 . 
 the study was approved by the committee on human research of the university of california , san francisco ; university of california , los angeles ; naval medical research center detachment and cayetano heredia university of peru . 
 we collected data only from participants that gave written informed consent to participate in the study . 
 between 2003 and 2005 ,   we recruited and assessed 308 women from 20 low - income communities in coastal peru . the overall prevalence of t . 
 women with t. vaginalis   infection were more likely to be older ; the highest prevalence was found in the oldest age group , 3640 years ( figure 1 ) . those with less education were 3 times more likely to have trichomonal infection compared to those who completed high school , and being single 
 the prevalence of trichomonal infection among women with vaginal discharge and painful urination in the prior six months was lower than the prevalence among those who did not report vaginal discharge during the same period , although the difference was not statistically significant . 
 women with hsv-2 infection and syphilis infection were twice as likely to have trichomonal infection . in the multivariate model , because only the number of partners in the past 6 months significantly improved the model , no other variables were entered into the model . 
 vaginalis   infection among socially - marginalized young women from low - income communities in coastal peru . 
 t. vaginalis   infection occurred more often among older women ( see figure 1 ) , women who had not completed high school , single women , women who reported unprotected sex with a nonsteady partner , and women who reported multiple sex partners . 
 no association was found between any vaginal symptoms and t. vaginalis . while most epidemiological studies on trichomonal infection have been focused on pregnant women , adolescents , and female sex workers accessing care , there are few studies at the population - level and in particular , socially - marginalized women [ 5 , 1519 ] . 
 our findings are important because such hard to reach populations are often under - represented because they are not seeking health care and represent a high - risk target population and potential core population that maintain endemic trichomonal infections at the population level . in latin america trichomonal prevalence 
 has varied from 2.9% to 16.5% , where the highest prevalence was found in population samples in the jungle and the highlands of per , and the lower prevalences were found in clinical settings such as family planning clinics , pharmacies , and obstetrics services . in general , tested populations in those studies were most often symptomatic women [ 15 , 20 , 21 ] . 
 the association between higher prevalence of trichomonal infection and older age is unusual for nonviral sexually transmitted infections . 
 the increased prevalence of trichomonal infection in older women suggests long - term prevalent infection that does not spontaneously resolve and would be missed by screening programs focused on younger age women . 
 the prevalence of trichomonal infection was not different between women with or without presence of recent painful urination or vaginal discharge . 
 that finding suggests that syndromic management of t. vaginalis   may result in both over and under treatment . 
 the asymptomatic nature of trichomonal infection also could contribute to a long duration of infection and continued spread of infection in the population [ 1 , 7 , 23 ] . 
 our data , and others [ 4 , 21 , 24 ] , attest to the asymptomatic nature of t. vaginalis   and the need for screening and treatment programs to control the spread of trichomonal infection . 
 results from other peruvian studies as well as the results in the present study indicate that there is no direct relationship between t. vaginalis   infection and symptoms making syndromic treatment unlikely to impact the population burden of infection [ 20 , 21 ] . 
 first , the sample size was small resulting in limited power to assess multivariate models between demographic and behavioral characteristics and t. vaginalis . 
 furthermore , the results presented here may not be generalizable to other female populations . while response bias is always a concern , we believe that the use of standardized interviews by trained staff helped to minimize social desirability and other information biases . 
 importantly as all epidemiologic information was collected prior to testing , there was no reason to suspect differential bias associated by trichomonal infection . 
 selection bias was also a concern , but because most women were asymptomatic we do not believe that those with potential trichomonal infection were more likely to participate compared with those without infection . since t. vaginalis   is a common sexually transmitted pathogen , the screening and treatment of sex partners of infected women must be also prioritized as a public health measure to prevent reinfection and reduce infection prevalence and complications in untreated males [ 23 , 25 ] . as the majority of the assessed population in this study was in a fertile age range , 
 our findings support the need for improved disease control activities to reduce adverse trichomoniasis - associated reproductive health outcomes such as ectopic pregnancy , low infant birth weight , preterm labor , and non - hpv associated cervical neoplasia [ 14 , 26 , 27 ] . 
 as t. vaginalis is widely prevalent and one of the easiest infections to treat with an inexpensive antimicrobial , further studies are needed to determine if screening and treatment of trichomoniasis will improve the reproductive health and birth outcomes of women .","objective . the epidemiology of trichomonas vaginalis infection among sexually active socially - marginalized women in three urban ,

"human cystic echinococcosis ( ce ) , caused by echinococcus granulosus , is one of the most important and widespread parasitic zoonoses ( 1 ) . 
 humans acquire infection by accidental ingestion of e. granulosus eggs voided in the faeces of infected dogs and the disease is common in parts of the world where there is close contact between the intermediate and definitive hosts , usually sheep and dogs , respectively ( 2 ) . 
 cystic echinococcosis in humans usually presents with symptoms associated with the presence of fluid - filled cysts in the liver , lungs , or other viscera and diagnosis is usually established by a combination of radiology and serology ( 3 ) . 
 one of the problems that can be encountered after treating ce patients is the risk of postsurgical relapses or treatment failure due to nonradical surgical procedures or perisurgical spillage of parasite material , especially protoscoleces . 
 relapses in the form of newly developing cysts have been reported and may affect between 2 and 25% of cases after therapy , according to previous studies ( 46 ) . 
 therefore , postsurgical follow - up of ce patients for years is necessary , with the aim of detecting newly growing cysts as soon as possible . 
 a posttreatment follow - up method to prognostically determine the efficacy of treatment should therefore include markers that allow the detection of newly growing or relapsing cysts and tracking of previously undetected but still viable cysts . 
 serology has been one of the methods selected for the post - operative control of hydatidosis . however , the long persistence of anti - e . 
 granulosus antibodies after recovery makes difficult the diagnosis of relapse by serology ( 7 ) . in this sense , many serologic techniques have been evaluated ( latex agglutination , passive hemagglutination , immunoelectrophoresis and specific ige , igm , igg enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ) in the post - operative monitoring of hydatid disease patients . therefore , there is still a need to develop or improve immunodiagnostic tools in order to meet the requirements expressed by clinicians . 
 one approach consists of searching for and identifying new antigens that specifically allow the classification of patients into cured and noncured categories . 
 this study examined the pattern of antigenic bands essential for the serologic diagnosis of ce , revealed by immunoblotting analysis . 
 we also report on the post - operative evolution of patients treated for this disease and also determined the diagnostic performance of western blot . 
 blood samples were obtained from 50 patients ( 16 males and 34 females ; mean sd age was 31.111.2 years , range 969 years ) with clinically / radiologically diagnosed ce , 40 non - ce patients with different parasitic infections and malignancy and from 20 sex and age - matched healthy controls . 
 samples from all subjects were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4 c to obtain the serum . 
 the sera was divided in to 3 tubes for each subject and stored immediately at 70 c until analysis . 
 all ce patients were sampled 1 week before treatment and received antihelminthic treatment of albendazole , 400 mg twice a day for 3 months , plus praziquantel , 40 mg / kg / day for two weeks as per standard guidelines ( 8) and underwent surgical procedures . 
 all procedures were approved by the local ethical committee and all subjects gave their informed consent to the study . 
 the results were compared between preoperative and post - operative group and were evaluated statistically using paired  t test . 
 hydatid cyst fluid antigen ( hcf ) was prepared according to standard procedure as described earlier ( 9 ) . 
 briefly , the hydatid cyst fluid ( hcf ) was aseptically aspirated from fertile hydatid cysts obtained from livers of naturally infected sheep slaughtered at the local abattoir . 
 the aspirated fluid was centrifuged at 2000g for 20 min at 4 c to remove the protoscolices . 
 the supernatant was then filtered through a whatman wcn type membrane filter ( cellulose nitrate , 47 mm diameter , 0.45 m pore size ) and dialyzed against distilled water overnight at 4c using dialysis tubing ( sigma aldrich , usa ) with molecular weight cut off 2000 da ( dalton ) . 
 the antigen protein concentration was estimated by the lowry method ( 10 ) with bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) as a reference standard . 
 hydatid sheep antigen ( 40 g ) was subjected to discontinuous sds - page , using 12.5% gel in a bio - rad apparatus at 50 ma / gel for 1 hour . 
 the proteins separated were transferred from un - stained gels to nitrocellulose membranes ( schleicher & schuell , inc . , keene , u.s.a . ) by means of the phasttransfer ( pharmacia lkb ) following standardized procedures ( 11 ) . 
 efficacy of transfer was checked by staining the membrane with ponceau s stain ( 0.001 g / ml in 3% trichloro acetic acid ) . 
 the membranes with blotted antigen were cut into strips and blocked with 5% ( w / v ) of skimmed milk in washing buffer ( 10 mm tris , 150 mm nacl , and 0.05% tween 20 ; ph 7.4 ) for 2 hours . 
 the strips were incubated with test sera ( 1/100 dilution in washing buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) for 2 hours at room temperature . 
 after 3 washes ( each 15 min ) , the strips were incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti - human igg ( sigma ) at a dilution of 1/2000 ( in washing buffer+1% bsa ) for 2 h at room temperature . 
 after 3 washes as before , bound antigens was developed using diaminobanzidine ( dab ) substrate ( 0.1% h2o2 + 6 mg / ml dab in 50 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.6 ) . 
 molecular weight estimates were made by comparing the mobility of the different antigen fractions with these of prestained protein marker , broad range ( 8250 kda ) , ( new england biolabs , usa ) which were separated in the same gel of a hydatid fluid sample and electrotransferred to the same sheet .

 in the present study the age of patients varied between 969 years . the mean sd age of the patients was 31.1211.24 years . 
 the highest incidence of disease was recorded among patients between 20 to 49 years age . 
 the predominance of hydatidosis was in females ( 68% ) than in males ( 32% ) . 
 thirty four ( 34 ) of the radiologically and surgically confirmed cases had hepatic cysts while 16 had extrahepatic cysts ( 12-lung cysts , 3-liver and lung and 1-thigh cyst ) . 
 all patients responded to pharmacological and surgical treatment except for two women ( 32 and 36 years old ) in whom multiple cysts ( 12 and 7 cysts ) were detected in liver and lung two years after the first operation . 
 igg reactivity from patients with cystic echinococcosis revealed multiple immunoreactive bands ranging from 18239 kda ( fig . 
 igg immunoreactivity of hydatid sera against different antigenic fractions in pre - operative samples the major immunoreactive bands were 24 , 39 , 46 , 52 , 57 , 6061 and 63 kda ( table 1 ) . 
 sera from patients with other parasitic infections and malignancy showed cross - reactivity with the cluster of 5459 kda bands .

 different conventional serological techniques for the diagnosis of human cystic echinococcosis have been developed , but their diagnostic value is limited because of the variable sensitivity and specificity ( 12 ) . in recent years , western 
 blotting has created a new era in immunodiagnosis , which greatly reduces cross - reactions . 
 this technique has been reported to give specific results in human studies ( 13 , 14 ) . 
 therefore , the present study was designed to use this technique for the diagnosis and post - operative follow - up of ce patients . 
 the igg reactivity in the sera of pre - operative patients identified multiple immunoreactive bands with the molecular weight ranging from 18239 kda . 
 our results are in agreement with previous study , where the predominance of 24 , 3234 , 4446 and 5254 kda was observed in sera of patients with hepatic and pulmonary cystic echinococcosis . 
 kanwer et al . , ( 16 ) also noticed the antigenic bands of high molecular weight ranging from 8116 kda with the frequent occurrence of 8 kda , 16 , 24 , 38 , 45 , 58 kda in ce patients . 
 the antigenic bands of 1214 , 16 , 20 , 2426 , 34 , 39 and 42 kda in molecular weight enabled the detection of antibodies in the pre - surgical samples and antibodies specific to 39 and 42 kda disappeared in less than one year in the patients cured after surgery in ce patients ( 17 ) . 
 al - olayan and helmy , ( 18 ) observed the antigenic bands of 22 , 24 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 6065 , 80 , 97 and 110 kda were recognised by sera from hydatidosis patients . 
 there are not enough studies about the immunoreactivity of igg with high molecular mass antigenic bands in patients with ce ( 16 , 19 , 20 ) . 
 the results revealed that 57 kda band cross - reacts with patient sera containing antibodies of other parasitic infections such as ascariasis , amoebiasis , toxoplasmosis and malignancy . 
 the non - specificity may be caused mainly by a sharing of hydatid antigen with those of other parasites ( 21 ) but other possible reasons are interaction with some blood group antigen ( 22 ) or with non - specific host proteins in hydatid fluid ( 23 ) . 
 the variability in the results could be due to many reasons , the source of antigen used as sheep hydatid fluid ( 15 ) , camel hydatid fluid ( 18 ) , human hydatid fluid ( 24 ) , the differences in purification protocols may also change the ability of antigens to recognized the specific antibodies ( 25 ) , differences in experimental condition , differences in echinococcus strains and geographical / clinical characteristics of patients ( 26 ) . 
 the results verified all the purified antigenic bands except 57 kda were specific to hydatid antibodies as they did not cross - react with the antibodies of other parasitic infections . 
 the application of western blotting for monitoring the surgical treatment is a subject that is not available in the literature . with the use of different antigenic bands 
 , it was verified that western blotting technique shows a disappearance of some bands in the post - operative case , as well as the persistence of some bands . 
 this latter situation agrees with the differences in the reactivity of the different isotypes of immunoglobulins with the hydatid antigens , observed with the western blotting technique applied to sera of patients suffering hepatic hydatidosis ( 20 ) . 
 the western blotting appears to be a useful method for diagnosing hydatidosis and for post - surgical monitoring , incapable at the moment of being detected by any other immunologic technique , given that the other techniques react with all the antigens without the ability of observing the appearance or disappearance of the bands observed only with the western blotting . in this sense , the antibodies against proteins of 24 , and 39 kda constitute a good marker for post - surgical monitoring , since in the cases of surgically cured patients these disappear in post - operative samples , while they remain as long as cysts persist . 
 further studies are also required to analyze the behaviour of these antibodies after medical treatment . 
 the western blotting appears to be a useful method for post - surgical monitoring because the antibodies against proteins of 24 and 39 kda constitute a good marker for post - surgical monitoring , since in the cases of cured patients these disappear in postoperative samples , while they remain as long as cysts persist . 
 ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc ) have been completely observed by the authors .","background : cystic echinococcosis ( ce ) is one of the most important parasitic zoonosis worldwide . 
 due to the high recurrence rate of the disease after surgery , follow up of the patient is necessary . 
 the aim of current research was to assess the performance of western blotting ( wb ) , using sheep hydatid fluid , for serological diagnosis and post - treatment monitoring of human ce.methods:serum samples obtained from 50 clinically / radiologically proven cases of ce along with serum samples from non - ce patients and healthy persons were tested by wb , using sheep hydatid fluid as antigen.results:the wb test enabled the detection of antibodies in the pre - operative samples for proteins of 18239 kda in molecular weight . from 50 sera of ce patients , 31 cases ( 72.09% ) 
 detected 52 kda subunit , 27 cases ( 62.79% ) detected 24 kda band , 26 cases ( 60.46% ) recognised 39 kda band and 21 cases ( 48.83% ) identified 46 kda component of sheep hydatid antigen . 
 sera from patients with other parasitic infections and malignancy showed cross - reactivity with the cluster of 5459 kda bands . 
 the healthy control sera were not reactive to any antigenic fraction . 
 the antigenic bands with molecular weight of 52 , 24 , 39 and 46 kda were specific for ce , and may serve as useful diagnostic markers . 
 the antibodies specific to proteins 24 and 39 kda significantly decreased in the patients cured after surgery , while in patients with recurrent parasitism the bands present before surgery persisted.conclusion:the wb with sheep hydatid antigen might be useful in the diagnosis and post - surgical monitoring of ce patients .",pubmed
"obesity is a common metabolic disease world - wide and dyslipidemias among the most common metabolic disorders associated with obesity [ 17 ] . 
 obesity is often described by classical parameters such as body mass index ( bmi ) , waist circumference ( wc ) , and waist - to - hip ratio ( whr ) [ 13,7,8 ] . 
 results of meta - regression analysis of prospective , randomized studies showed that whr and wc may play important roles in assessment of increased risk of cardiovascular ( cv ) events . in recent years 
 , attention has been drawn to new obesity indices ( e.g. , waist - to - height ratio ( whtr ) , visceral adiposity index ( vai ) , and body adiposity index ( bai ) , which also take into account adipose tissue distribution [ 1316 ] . 
 results of the some recently published studies suggest that whtr , the newer obesity index , may be helpful for assessing risk of metabolic complications , including dyslipidemia , and it may also be a predictor of cardiovascular events in obese patients [ 1,8,1620 ] . nevertheless , there is little data about the associations between other newer obesity indices ( e.g. , vai and bai ) and lipid profile in obese patients . 
 therefore , the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between obesity parameters or indices ( bmi , wc , whr , whtr , bai , vai ) and serum lipid levels of total cholesterol ( tc ) , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , triglycerides ( tg ) , and lipid indices such as tc / hdl - c , ldl - c / hdl - c , and tg / hdl - c ratios in obese non - diabetic patients . 
 this cross - sectional study was conducted in a population of 66 consecutively enrolled obese non - diabetic patients ( bmi 30 kg / m ) with mean age of 55.811.6 years , including 40 women ( mean age 57.510.8 years ) and 26 men ( mean age 53.312.3 years ) treated in the outpatient department of hypertension and lipid disorders of wam university hospital in lodz , poland . patients with fasting hyperglycemia 5.6 
 mmol / l ( 100 mg / dl ) underwent a glucose tolerance test ( 75 g ) to exclude diabetes mellitus ( dm ) . 
 patients with dm , pregnancy , cancer , acute stroke , acute hepatic or renal diseases and acute cardiovascular events or with history of abdominal surgery , which could have an impact on abdominal fat distribution , were excluded from the study . 
 patients with psychiatric disorders receiving antipsychotic agents that might impact appetite and lead to weight gain were also excluded . based on calculated bmi values , patients were divided into 3 groups according to their obesity level : group i consisted of patients with obesity class i with bmi of 30.034.9 kg / m ; group ii consisted of patients with obesity class ii with bmi of 35.039.9 kg / m ; and group iii consisted of patients with obesity class iii with bmi 40 kg / m . 
 the study was conducted after receiving approval from the bioethics committee of the medical university of lodz , resolution no . 
 all the patients underwent a complete blood count , lipid and liver profile , tsh , glucose , renal function indices ( bun and creatinine ) , and general urinalysis . 
 the serum ldl - c level was calculated based on friedewald s formula ( in mmol / l ) : measurements accurate to within 0.1 kg were made of body mass , and measurements accurate to within 0.5 cm were made of height , wc , and hc . wc was measured at mid - distance between the last rib and the iliac crest , while hc was measured at the level of the greater trochanter . 
 based on these measurements , the following body mass - related indices were calculated using the following formulas : bmi = body mass ( kg ) / [ height ( m ) ] whr = wc ( cm ) / hc ( cm ) whtr = wc ( cm ) / height ( cm ) men vai = [ wc / 39.68 + ( 1.88  bmi ) ]  ( tg / 1.03 )  ( 1.31 / hdl ) ; women vai = [ wc / 36.58 + ( 1.89  bmi ) ]  ( tg / 0.81 )  ( 1.52 / hdl ) . 
 bai = [ hip circumference ( cm ) / height ( m ) ]  18 [ 1315,18 ] . 
 in addition , based on the lipid profile results obtained , the following lipid metabolism indices were calculated : tc / hdl - c ratio 
 values > 5 indicate increased cardiovascular risk ; ldl - c / hdl - c ratio  increased cardiovascular risk with values > 3 ; tg / hdl - c ratio  increased cardiovascular risk with values 3 . 
 the results are presented as mean values with standard deviation ( normality of distribution was tested using the shapiro - wilk test ) . 
 significance of differences between groups was assessed using the t - test for independent samples , and in the case of multiple comparisons ( more than 2 study groups ) , univariate analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied with subsequent use of post - hoc multiple comparison tests ( tukey s test ) . for statistical analysis of discontinuous results , 
 values of p<0.05 were assumed to be statistically significant . to assess the relationship and correlation between obesity indices and lipid metabolism parameters , pearson s linear correlation analysis was used , along with a linear regression model with a 95% confidence interval . 
 this cross - sectional study was conducted in a population of 66 consecutively enrolled obese non - diabetic patients ( bmi 30 kg / m ) with mean age of 55.811.6 years , including 40 women ( mean age 57.510.8 years ) and 26 men ( mean age 53.312.3 years ) treated in the outpatient department of hypertension and lipid disorders of wam university hospital in lodz , poland . patients with fasting hyperglycemia 5.6

 bai = [ hip circumference ( cm ) / height ( m ) ]  18 [ 1315,18 ] . 
 in addition , based on the lipid profile results obtained , the following lipid metabolism indices were calculated : tc / hdl - c ratio  values 
 > 5 indicate increased cardiovascular risk ; ldl - c / hdl - c ratio  increased cardiovascular risk with values > 3 ; tg / hdl - c ratio  increased cardiovascular risk with values 3 . 
 the results are presented as mean values with standard deviation ( normality of distribution was tested using the shapiro - wilk test ) .

 values of p<0.05 were assumed to be statistically significant . to assess the relationship and correlation between obesity indices and lipid metabolism parameters , pearson s linear correlation analysis was used , along with a linear regression model with a 95% confidence interval . 
 there were no statistically significant differences in clinical characteristic between compared groups ( table 1 ) . among persons enrolled in the study , 
 the largest group consisted of dyslipidemic patients , accounting for 90.9% of the general study population , while hypercholesterolemia was present in 43.9% , mixed hyperlipidemia in 36.4% , and hypertriglyceridemia in 10.6% of subjects ( table 1 ) . 
 hypertension was diagnosed in 83.3% patients from the whole study population ( table 1 ) . 
 patients from group iii had greater mean wc compared to group ii and i ( table 2 ) . 
 patients in obesity class ii also had greater mean wc than in group i. mean whtr , bmi , and bai values were higher in group iii compared to group ii and group i ( table 2 ) . 
 higher mean whtr and bmi were observed in group ii compared to group i ( table 2 ) . 
 mean serum tc and ldl - c in group iii were significantly lower than in group i ( table 2 ) . 
 negative significant correlations were found in the whole study population between : bmi and tc , ldl - c , hdl - c ; wc , whr , vai and hdl - c ( table 3 ) . 
 by contrast , positive significant correlations were found between wc , whr , and tg / hdl - c , as well as between vai and : tc , tg , tc / hdl - c , ldl / hdl - c , and tg / hdl - c ( table 3 ) . 
 lipid disorders were the most frequent concomitant disorders in our study population . the high incidence of dyslipidemia in obese patients was also shown in 2 large polish epidemiological studies 
 interestingly , the group of patients with class iii obesity had lower mean serum levels of tc and ldl - c compared with patients from the other 2 groups , and this difference was statistically significant when compared to the patients with class i obesity . 
 this result was not related to lipid - lowering treatment because of lack of statistically significant differences between compared groups . 
 similar results were obtained in the study lipidogram 2004 , where higher serum levels of tc , ldl - c , and tg were found in overweight people compared with the obese . on the other hand 
 , the negative correlations observed in our study between bmi , wc , and ldl - c might have resulted from a lower ldl - c level in patients with morbid obesity as previously observed by others [ 2628 ] . 
 found a 2-phase relationship between bmi , wc , and ldl - c levels , especially in women . 
 increase in bmi and wc values initially resulted in increases in ldl - c levels , subsequently leading to reductions in the most obese persons . in native americans , 
 increase in ldl - c levels was positively correlated with bmi only for the first 3 quartiles , then this relationship was reversed . 
 the authors suggest that increase in adipose tissue in this population may decrease ldl - c levels in 2 ways : through increased activity of ldl - c receptors in adipose tissue or because of diluting the circulating pool of ldl - c through the increased circulating blood volume in more obese people . 
 it must also be noted that levels of small , dense ldl ( sdldl ) fractions , as in our study , were not measured and a preponderance of sdldl induced by insulin resistance can lead to significant reductions in ldl - c . 
 howard et al . concluded , based on results of clinical studies , that the relationship between bmi and ldl - c serum levels is complex and depends on numerous factors such as age or sex . 
 it was demonstrated that higher ldl - c levels were seen in young ( 2044 years of age ) obese women , and were positively correlated with bmi . 
 the authors did not observe significant differences between patients from different obesity classes with regards to levels of hdl - c and tg . in the strong heart study conducted in 773 women and 739 men of native american origin , 
 hu et al . found significant negative correlation between bmi and hdl - c in women . 
 wc values were positively correlated with serum tg levels and negatively correlated with hdl - c levels , and the relation between wc and assessed lipid fraction levels in women was much stronger than in the case of bmi . in men , 
 positive correlations were observed between bmi , wc , and tg levels , as well as a negative correlation between bmi , wc , and hdl - c levels , although , in contrast with women , the strength of correlation was comparable for both obesity parameters . 
 data obtained from the available literature suggest that increasing bmi results in decreasing hdl - c levels and increasing tg levels . 
 these studies , however , were conducted in general populations rather than selected groups of patients with obesity . 
 these observations are also supported by the results of a study conducted in 1518 adult peruvians , where the authors found a very strong negative correlation between bmi , vai , and the hdl - c fractions , as well as a positive correlation with tg ; however , this was irrespective of gender . 
 we also found a negative correlation between bmi , wc , whr , and hdl - c , but not with tg . 
 similar findings were observed in the prospective epidemiological study of myocardial infarction ( prime ) and by mojiminiyi et al . . 
 the negative correlation between wc and hdl - c levels observed in our study is supported by results presented by hu et al . 
 ; however , unlike the present authors , no statistically significant correlation between bmi , wc , and tg was found , although a similar tendency was present . 
 the above - mentioned negative correlation between wc and hdl - c was also reported by chehrei et al . in 750 non - obese people . 
 the results of our study suggest that obesity , especially abdominal obesity , is significantly associated with dyslipidemia , which manifests itself mainly with reductions in hdl - c . 
 it is especially evident with the vai index , which demonstrated the strongest correlation with tg and hdl - c levels and with the lipid indices tc / hdl - c , ldl - c / hdl - c , and tg / hdl - c . 
 this is not surprising , however , given the fact that the vai formula includes both the hdl - c and tg levels . 
 the positive correlation observed in our study between whr and tg / hdl - c ratio is supported by results obtained by marrotta et al . 
 results of our study demonstrate a relationship between some selected obesity indices , especially those pertaining to visceral obesity , and lipid parameters . 
 this is especially the case with new , recently proposed obesity indices , such as vai , whtr , and bai , which have been investigated in only a few studies to date [ 1,1316 ] . 
 one strength of this study is that there is relatively little information on obese patients grouped according to obesity level , especially among the morbidly obese ( bmi 40 kg / m ) . 
 most studies have assessed the relationship between obesity indices and lipid metabolism parameters in the general population , and sometimes in non - overweight or healthy people . 
 obesity is associated with lipid disturbances , especially with hdl - c reduction , in obese non - diabetic patients . 
 vai is strongly related with lipid profile and thus may be the most valuable obesity index in obese patients with dyslipidemias . 
 ","backgroundthe aim of this cross - sectional study was to examine the relationship between obesity and lipid markers.material/methodswe divided 66 non - diabetic adult obese patients ( mean age : 55.811.6 years ) into 3 groups according to body mass index ( bmi ) . 
 all patients were measured for waist circumference ( wc ) , hip circumference ( hc ) , body mass index ( bmi ) , waist - to - hip ratio ( whr ) , waist - to - height ratio ( whtr ) , body adiposity index ( bai ) , and visceral adiposity index ( vai ) . 
 serum levels of total cholesterol ( tc ) , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) , and triglycerides ( tg ) were determined , and lipid indices tc / hdl , ldl / hdl , and tg / hdl were also estimated.resultstc and ldl - c in group iii were lower than in group i ( 5.01.0 vs. 6.01.0 mmol / l , and 2.90.9 vs. 3.81.2 
 mmol / l ; p<0.05 for both ) . 
 negative correlations were found between : bmi and tc , ldl , and hdl ( r=0.291 ; r=0.310 , r=0.240 , respectively ) ; and wc , whr , vai , and hdl ( r=0.371 , r=0.296 , r=0.376 , respectively ) . 
 positive correlations were found between wc , whr , and tg / hdl ( r=0.279 , r=0.244 , respectively ) and between vai and : tc ( r=0.327 ) , tg ( r=0.885 ) , tc / hdl ( r=0.618 ) , ldl / hdl ( r=0.480 ) , and tg / hdl ( r=0.927).conclusionsobesity is associated with lipid disturbances , especially with hdl - c reduction , in obese non - diabetic patients . 
 vai is strongly related to lipid profile and thus may be the most valuable obesity index in obese patients with dyslipidemias .",pubmed

 ","frequency stability is key to performance of nanoresonators . this stability is thought to reach a limit with the resonator s ability to resolve thermally - induced vibrations . 
 although measurements and predictions of resonator stability usually disregard fluctuations in the mechanical frequency response , these fluctuations have recently attracted considerable theoretical interest . 
 however , their existence is very difficult to demonstrate experimentally . here , through a literature review , 
 we show that all studies of frequency stability report values several orders of magnitude larger than the limit imposed by thermomechanical noise . 
 we studied a monocrystalline silicon nanoresonator at room temperature , and found a similar discrepancy . 
 we propose a new method to show this was due to the presence of frequency fluctuations , of unexpected level . 
 the fluctuations were not due to the instrumentation system , or to any other of the known sources investigated . 
 these results challenge our current understanding of frequency fluctuations and call for a change in practices .",pubmed
"cesarean sections ( cs ) performed following a medical indication is necessary for life - saving . 
 it is a surgical intervention to prevent maternal or perinatal complications and the appropriate rate of use should be one associated with the lowest rate of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality . 
 however , women are increasingly undergoing cs without any medical indication , which may contribute to the world - wide higher rates of cs . 
 there has been a debate about the appropriateness of cs performed due to maternal request or what physicians suggest to their patients . 
 result of the world health organization ( who ) global survey in a large cross - sectional study demonstrated severe maternal morbidity in planned cesarean delivery are higher than planned vaginal delivery ( vd ) . who recommended 10 - 15% rate of cesarean section . 
 this recommendation was based on the cesarean section rates of the countries with the lowest maternal and neonatal mortality rates in the world at that moment . 
 many studies have shown that the actual rate of cs in numerous countries is far higher than the recommended range . 
 the rate of cesarean section out of all deliveries in iran increased by six - fold over the past three decades . 
 these results are in accordance with previous reports that confirm the growing rate of cs in iran . 
 however , the debate on the best practices ( vd vs. cs ) to minimize postnatal morbidity still is a matter of controversy both from professionals perspectives and from women 's perceptions of the childbirth experience . 
 the postpartum period are critical life events for women leading to physiological , emotional , and social changes . 
 postpartum mothers experience certain physical health conditions that may affect their quality - of - life ( qol ) , future health , and health of their children . 
 several studies confirm that socio - economic deficiencies and medical problem are risk factors for decreased qol and depressive symptoms in women during the postnatal period . 
 mode of delivery and childbirth experience may have a long - term effect on self - rated health . 
 several studies have investigated the association between type of delivery and health related quality - of - life ( hrqol ) , but there is conflicting , with some studies reporting decreased hrqol in cesarean delivery . whereas , other studies did not confirm any relations between cs and hrqol . in a study 
 it was found that patients after vd had higher mean physical hrqol scores than after cs while mean mental hrqol were similar among vd and cs groups . in another study , 
 however , careful assessment of the predictor variables of poorer physical and mental health after childbirth may improve the quality of postpartum care . 
 the aim of this study was to explore the impact of delivery mode on women 's postpartum physical and mental health related qol . 
 a prospective study was performed in the period august 2007 to october 2008 of pregnant women who admitted for prenatal care in the health center . 
 a total of 10 health center were selected randomly in kashan city in iran . after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria , 
 there were 365 consecutive women that agreed to take part in the study and all women gave their informed consent before entering the study . of whom 342 women entering the study after delivery consist of 175 ( % 51.2 ) mothers after vd and 167 ( % 48.8 ) mothers after cs ( elective or emergency cs ) , in follow - up 2 months after delivery ( time 1 assessment ) 162 women after vd and 159 after cs completed qol questionnaire . 
 of whom 150 women in each type of delivery completed qol questionnaire 4 months after delivery again ( time 2 assessment ) in health centers . in these analyses , we have included all women with singleton , live born infant , term pregnancy , prenatal care started before 20 weeks gestation , having uncomplicated pregnancies , parity 1 - 3 and the study population was ethnically iranian , not having : others pre - existing diseases , history of infertility , and divorce . 
 excluding criteria were instrumental delivery , birth weight less than 2,500 g , child or fetal dead , child abnormality , not breast feeding and medical problems in child and mother . 
 all patients were interviewed by the trained midwives and a structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women 's socio - demographic characteristics and obstetric variables . 
 also we used a generic hrqol instrument to measure qol ( categorized into physical and mental health ) . 
 qol was assessed using the iranian version of short form-36 health survey social functioning ( sf-36 ) . 
 sf-36 is a standard and well - known generic health related qol instrument and proved to be highly feasible , reliable and is a good choice to measure health related qol after delivery . 
 it consists of 36 items , organized into eight scales : physical functioning ( pf ) , role limitation due to physical problems or role physical ( rp ) , bodily pain ( bp ) , general health ( gh ) , vitality ( vt ) , social functioning ( sf ) , role limitation due to emotional problems or role emotional ( re ) , and emotional well - being ( ew ) . 
 the scores on each subscale range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating a better condition , the sf-36 furthermore provides physical health ( based on the pf , rp , bp , and gh scales ) and a mental health ( relating to vt , sf , re , and ew ) . 
 we compared women 's socio - demographic characteristics and physical and mental health scores between women with vd and cs that completed qol questionnaire at 2 and 4 months after delivery ( 150 vd and 150 cs ) . 
 furthermore score differences within each mode of delivery between time 2 and time 1assessment were evaluated . 
 differences in means were analyzed using the student 's t - test and the mann 
 the study protocol was approved by the local research committee in kashan university of medical sciences . 
 there were no significant differences between vd and cesarean groups with regard to these variables . 
 maternal age was between 20 and 40 and vd was performed up to % 80 with episiotomy or laceration . 
 the physical and mental health parameters related qol at 2 months follow - up has shown in table 2 ; total physical health score in vd women was higher than cs group . 
 mean scores was 60.52  13.28 and 57.37  12.20 ( p = 0.034 ) respectively . on performing a detailed analysis , statistically significant differences in 2 parameters ; 
 pf ( p = 0.001 ) and rp ( p = 0.026 ) were found . 
 total mental health score in cs women was generally higher than vd , but differences were not significant . comparing physical and mental health parameters at 4 months postpartum 
 results showed that the vd group in compared cs group had a higher score in total physical health ( 61.37  13.05 and 58.36  14.09 p = 0.05 ) and total mental health was ( 64.99  12.44 and 61.83  13.58 p = 0.036 ) respectively . in comparing subscales ; 
 differences statistically significant were found for 1 parameter in physical health ( physical function p = 0.01 ) and for 2 parameter in mental health ( sf p = 0.036 and ew p = 0.042 ) . 
 to compare the findings within each group results demonstrated that the vd group showed more improvements on total mental hrqol from time 1 to time 2 assessment [ table 4 ] . 
 the mean score differences ( 4 months scores minus 2 months scores ) in vd and cs groups were 4.70  16.29 and 0.3  13.81 ( p = 0.01 ) respectively . in comparing subscales differences 
 statistically significant were found for 2 parameter ( sf p = 0.03 and ew p = 0.01 ) . 
 general characteristics of patients according to mode of delivery distribution of postpartum physical and mental health according to mode of delivery at 2 months after delivery distribution of postpartum physical and mental health according to mode of delivery at 4 months after delivery the mean score differences within each mode of delivery ( 4 months scores  2 months scores ) * 
 our study showed that physical hrqol at 2 and 4 months after delivery is better in women with vd . 
 there were significant differences in the pf and rp parameters in time 1 and pf in time 2 assessments . 
 also mental hrqol at 4 months after delivery and improvement on mental hrqol from time 1 to time 2 assessments was better in vd group ; differences were significant in sf and ew . 
 mental hrqol at 2 months after delivery was better in cs group but differences were not significant in each of parameters ; a reason for this occurred is mothers after cs supported better due to surgical intervention . also , 
 in our study , nearly % 80 of vd was performed with episiotomy or laceration . in a study , the median time to restart intercourse in the normal vd with episiotomy was 40 days and in the cs group was 10 days postpartum and there was significant decreases in the sexual functioning scores after vd when compared to cs group . concerning its effects on postpartum sexual functioning . 
 sexual health is perceived as an integral part of gh as it can affect postpartum depression . 
 there are many studies that assess morbidity resulting from vd and cs , but a few studies have focused on women 's postpartum hrqol . 
 however , our results are consistent with several studies but differ from some of the previous studies ; in a prospective study 100 women were interviewed ( 50 with normal delivery and 50 with cs ) . 
 qol was measured using the sf-36 at two points ( time 1 : 6 - 8 weeks after delivery and time 2 : 12 - 14 weeks after delivery ; result showed vd group had a better qol for almost all subscales in both assessment times , the differences were significant for vt , mental health and pf . 
 another study was performed to investigated fatigue and hrqol in women after vd , elective cs and emergency cs . 
 a total of 141 women ( 71 after vd , 36 after elective cs and 34 after emergency cs ) completed the hrqolsf-36 questionnaires ; result showed patients after vd had higher mean physical hrqol scores than after cs , but the mean mental hrqol scores of the study groups were similar . 
 in contrast these results a cross - sectional study evaluated the effect of delivery mode on women 's postpartum qol in rural china . in this study , 
 none of six dimensions and total score of qol displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cs . in this study , cs rate was 70.0% , and most of them ( 59.7% ) were selected by maternal request . 
 the most important in this data being a high frequency of cs due to maternal request also other factors such as lower education level and male gender of infant were associated with poor qol and whereas , in our study , these factors were similar in two groups . however , socio - cultural determinants may contribute in influencing postnatal qol . 
 safarinejad et al . in a cohort study showed the qol parameters by using sf-36 questionnaire in planned cs women were generally higher than vd . 
 there were differences significant for two physical health domains ( gh and rp ) and all of the mental health domains . in this study planned cs compared to vd and all of the women were parity 1 and younger age . 
 one might argue the findings were influenced by the fact that women with elective or emergency cesarean may experience rather different qol during the postnatal period . 
 furthermore in primipara women other reasons are associated with poor qol . in our study , cs consist of elective or emergency and parity was 1 - 3 . in another study dunn and oherlihy compared satisfaction levels by early postnatal questionnaire among 140 women who had a vaginal birth after delivery ( vbac ) with women who had cesarean section after vaginal delivery . 
 the vbac group experienced minimal pain after delivery and had felt better prepared for delivery . in our study , 
 subscale pain at 2 month after delivery was similar in two groups ; one reason was high frequency of episiotomy in vd group , it is important to pay attention to this risk factor to be able to offer good care and treatment to women during postpartum where necessary . in a prospective study in mothers who requested cesarean section in the absence of medical indication , their reason for the request , self - estimated health and experience of delivery were investigated . 
 results showed women requesting cesarean section experienced their health as less good and were more often planning for one child only . 
 they more often reported anxiety for lack of support during the labor , for loss of control and concern for fetal injury or death . 
 after planned cesarean section women in this group reported a better birth experience compared to women planning a vaginal birth . 
 there were no differences in signs of postpartum depression between the groups 3 months after birth . 
 however intended caesarean delivery was found to be an independent risk factor for complications and is associated with an increased risk of maternal rehospitalization . 
 furthermore mean duration of sickness and mean days required for returning to normal activities were also higher in case of caesarian section also it is expensive than normal vaginal delivery . 
 our research was a prospective study , data were obtained from the participants by trained questionnaires and study population was ethnically uniform . 
 unfortunately , we only used a general instrument and this might be considered as a limitation . 
 another limitation of the study was that the type of cesarean section was not considered , women with elective or emergency cesarean may experience rather different qol during postpartum . 
 the findings suggest that vd lead to a better physical health at 2 months after delivery and physical and mental health at 4 months after delivery . 
 furthermore , we recommend the future studies include both general and specific questionnaire in assessing postpartum qol among women with vd , elective cs and emergency cs , in addition other studies needed for recognizing social and cultural factors that are related to physical and mental hrqol after delivery .","background : the postpartum period is a critical life event for women leading physical , emotional , and social changes . 
 postpartum quality - of - life may be affected by delivery mode . 
 the purpose of this study was to determine the association between postpartum health related quality - of - life ( hrqol ) and mode of delivery.materials and methods : in a prospective study , 300 women consisting of 150 vaginal deliveries ( vd ) and 150 cesarean sections ( cs ) were recruited between august 2007 and october 2008 from health centers . 
 stratified random sampling was performed to select 10 health centers in kashan city , iran . 
 physical and mental hrqol was measured using the sf-36 questionnaire and compared between vd and cs groups 2 and 4 months after delivery . 
 data were analyzed by using the student 's t - test , mann  whitney u - test , and chi - square test.results:results showed physical hrqol at 2 months after vd was better than cs significantly ; there were significant differences in the physical functioning and role physical subscales . 
 furthermore mental hrqol at 4 months after vd was better than cs significantly ; there were significant difference in the social function and emotional health subscales.conclusion:the findings demonstrated that vd leads to a better physical health at 2 months after delivery and mental health at 4 months after delivery . 
 efforts should be made to reduce cs .",pubmed
"incremental improvements in the survivorship from cpr occurred as more and more people were trained in cpr and as defibrillators became portable and were deployed in more locations . 
 finally , most people who had suffered from cardiac arrest did not survive to leave the hospital or did so in a neurological devastated state . in the early of 21 century , the survival rate of cardiac arrest outside of the hospital remained 78% . 
 about one - quarter of patients regained pulses after cpr , and about one - third of the patients with those initial successes survived hospitalization . the severe brain defect after cpr stimulated many investigations into the pathophysiology of , and treatments for , global brain ischemia . 
 for the protection of patient 's brain , mild hypothermia therapy has been proposed . in many animal experiments 
 for example , it can increase the survival rate and improve neurological function of animal . 
 besides , it reduces metabolic rate and the expression of some pro - apoptosis proteins . in clinical trials , 
 the effectiveness of hypothermia also has been proved . hence , 2010 american heart association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care recommended , comatose patients with out - of - hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest were cooled to 3234c for 12 or 24 h. however , recent years some other clinical trials showed that mild hypothermia can not improve the prognosis of patients after cpr . 
 therefore , we conducted a meta - analysis of all relevant published studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mild hypothermia on patients with cardiac arrest . 
 studies were considered for inclusion if they met the following criteria : ( 1 ) all published randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) . ( 2 ) we included studies in adult patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated . 
 ( 3 ) the intervention was therapeutic mild hypothermia , no matter how to lower the body temperature . 
 the temperature should remain between 32c and 34c . and the treatment for the control group was according to the standard treatment after cardiac arrest without hypothermia . 
 the secondary outcomes were adverse events , such as rearrest , renal failure , pulmonary edema and so on . 
 ( 5 ) the relative risks ( rrs ) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) were reported . 
 studies were considered for exclusion if they met the following criteria : ( 1 ) we excluded studies on children and pregnant women . 
 ( 2 ) cardiac arrest patients under the treatment of mild hypothermia received other drugs in combination therapy . 
 ( 3 ) there was a history of central nervous system depressant drug medication prior to cardiac arrest . 
 an extensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases , manual searching , and correspondence with authors of included studies . 
 the cochrane library , pubmed , web of science , embase , cnki , and wan fang data were searched from the date of their establishment to october 2014 . 
 search terms used were  cooling ,   hypothermia ,   cpr ,   cardiac arrest  and  rct . 
 two reviewers independently reviewed the citations , abstracts , and full - text articles and determined the eligibility of all the studies identified in the initial search . 
 when the entire process was completed , the two cross - checked with each other . in cases of disagreements , a third reviewer was consulted . 
 the following details were extracted : authors , year of publication , sample size , interventions , and outcomes . 
 assessment of the quality of the included studies was performed using the methodology recommended by cochrane collaboration . 
 this method comprised assessments of the risk of potential bias in six domains : random sequence generation ( correct , incorrect or unclear ) , allocation concealment ( correct , incorrect or unclear ) , blinding of outcome assessment ( correct , incorrect or unclear ) , incomplete outcome data ( complete , incomplete or unclear ) , selective reporting ( yes , no or unclear ) , other bias ( yes , no or unclear ) , such as the baseline , source of funding , and academic biases . if all quality criteria were met , the trial was considered to have a low risk of bias ( score : a ) . 
 if one or more of the quality criteria were only partially met , the trial was considered to have moderate risk of bias ( score : b ) , and if one or more criteria not met , the trial was considered to have high risk of bias ( score : c ) . 
 statistical analysis was performed using review manager version 5.2 ( cochrane collaboration , oxford , uk ) software . 
 the heterogeneity of the qualitative analysis was assessed by chi - square test , and the significant level was set to p = 0.1 . 
 if p > 0.1 , i < 50% , the different rcts can be regarded as homogeneous . 
 if p < 0.1 , i  50% , the different rcts can be regarded as heterogeneity . 
 we used weighted mean deviation ( wmd ) and 95% ci to represent the continuous data . and

 . the survival rate of patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated is one of the primary outcomes which we concerned . 
 all of the six studies reported the survival rate in which three studies reported survival rate at hospital discharge ( subgroup 1 ) , the other three studies reported survival rate after 6 months ( subgroup 2 ) . 
 there was no heterogeneity from the outcome in subgroup 1 ( p = 0.50 , i = 0 ) and subgroup 2 ( p = 0.32 , i = 12% ) . 
 the pooled results showed [ figure 2 ] no significant difference in the survival rate at hospital discharge between treatment group and control group ( rr = 1.35 , 95% ci : 0.872.10 , p = 0.18 ) .

 the neurological function of patients who suffered from cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated is another primary outcome which we concerned . in clinical , cerebral performance category ( cpc ) 
 the cpc scale ranges from 1 to 5 , with 1 representing good cerebral performance ( conscious , alert , capable of normal life ) or minor disability which do not significantly compromise cerebral or physical function , 2 moderate cerebral disability ( function is sufficient for independent activities of daily life ) , 3 severe cerebral disability , dependent on others for daily life support , 4 coma or vegetative state ( not conscious , unaware of surroundings , no cognition ) , and 5 brain death . included studies considered cpc 12 as good neurological recovery and cpc 35 as bad neurological recovery . hence , these data can be converted to dichotomous data . all of the six studies reported the neurological function in which three studies reported neurological function at hospital discharge ( subgroup 3 ) , the other three studies reported neurological function after 6 months ( subgroup 4 ) .

 other adverse events such as pulmonary edema , pneumonia , bleeding , showed the same results ( data not shown ) . because only a single article mentioned the above adverse events , we did not put them into meta - analysis . 
 most studies at the top of the funnel plot , it meant the studies ci is narrow and their precision is high . to evaluate the influence of any single study on the pooled rr and ci 
 we omitted two high - risk studies from the overall analysis , the pooled rr ( 95% ci ) ranged from 1.25 ( 1.051.49 ) to 1.21 ( 1.011.45 ) for studies reporting the rrs by survival rate and from 1.37 ( 1.131.66 ) to 1.30 ( 1.061.59 ) for studies reporting the rrs by neurological function .

 funnel plot compares log relative risk ( rr ) versus the standard error of log rr for survival rate and neurological function (  : at hospital discharge ;  : at 6 months ) . 
 as the cpr technology became more and more mature , a growing number of patients with cardiac arrest were saved . 
 in the half past century especially the last 10 years , hypothermia is the only method that approved by a large amount of clinical trials which can improve the prognosis of patients . 
 meta - analysis can evaluate the effectiveness and safety of hypothermia which results are quite credible . in this study , we used meta - analysis to integrate these different independent researches , in order to get more reliable analysis about the efficacy of mild hypothermia for the treatment of patients with cardiac arrest . for patients rescued from cardiac arrest , we pay most attention to their prognosis . 
 the data of three studies were measured at hospital discharge , the other three were measured after 6 months . in order to avoid the heterogeneity first we analyzed the data by subgroups . 
 the mild hypothermia therapy can not improve survival rate and neurological function at hospital discharge . 
 we speculated the possible reasons are as follows : ( 1 ) whole - body hypothermia influences all organ systems , and any potential benefit should be balanced against possible side effects ; ( 2 ) in clinical treatment , combination hypothermia with many other drugs may bring about some unknown influences , for example it will reduce the rate of drug metabolism and so on ; ( 3 ) hypothermia revives neurons is a long and slow process , for some other reasons patients die before neurons recovery . 
 the pooled results showed us that mild hypothermia does improve survival rate and neurological function of patients with cardiac arrest . 
 for example : hypothermic blanket , ice packs , cold saline intravenous infusion and so on . 
 however , some other studies or meta - analysis hold the view that early initiation of rapid cooling can not improve the prognosis . 
 the possible mechanisms include : ( 1 ) hypothermia can reduce cerebral oxygen consumption and energy metabolism ; ( 2 ) it can reduce reactive oxygen species generation and release of excitatory amino acids ; ( 3 ) it also can preserve the integrity of the blood - brain barrier , regulate the gene expression of inflammatory protein and apoptotic proteins and reduce cell death . 
 although there are many advantages of mild hypothermia , we should not ignore the side effects . 
 in the included six studies , the main adverse events were re - arrest , renal failure , pulmonary edema and so on . 
 hence , we drew a conclusion mild hypothermia therapy for cardiac arrest patients is safe . 
 however , the study also suffers from several limitations : ( 1 ) the number of trial and the study size may be inadequate . 
 therefore , the precision of the outcome parameters obtained is generally low ; ( 2 ) another potential limitation of this meta - analysis is clinical and methodological heterogeneity . according to the six studies , we knew cardiac arrest patients with different first recorded cardiac rhythm are included . besides , the time from start of cooling to target temperature was different , the duration of keeping hypothermia was different and the methods of cooling body temperature were also different in these studies . 
 all of the above factors would lead to inaccurate results . in this meta - analysis 
 , we conducted a subgroup analysis according to different situations , although there was almost no heterogeneity . 
 but in order to get more accurate results , further research should include high - quality studies to analyze the impact of different cooling measures or different hypothermia duration on the survival rate and neurological function . in conclusions , 
 this meta - analysis demonstrated mild hypothermia can not improve survival rate and neurological function of patients at hospital discharge . 
 the pooled results showed mild hypothermia does improve prognosis of patients . and it does not influence the incidence of adverse events compared with the control group .","background : therapeutic hypothermia has been recommended for the treatment of cardiac arrest patients who remain comatose after the return of spontaneous circulation . 
 the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mild hypothermia on patients with cardiac arrest by conducting a meta-analysis.methods:the relevant trials were searched in cochrane library , pubmed , web of science , embase , cnki and wan fang data from the date of their establishment to october 2014 . 
 thereafter , the studies retrieved were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria . 
 data were extracted , and the quality of the included studies was evaluated . 
 a meta - analysis was conducted using the cochrane collaboration review manager 5.2 software.results:six randomized controlled trials involving 531 cases were included , among which 273 cases were assigned to the treatment group and the other 258 cases to the control group . 
 the meta - analysis indicated that mild hypothermia therapy after cardiac arrest produced significant differences in survival rate ( relative risk [ rr ] = 1.23 , 95% confidence interval [ ci ] : 1.021.48 , p = 0.03 ) and neurological function ( rr = 1.33 , 95% ci : 1.081.65 , p = 0.007 ) after 6 months compared with normothermia therapy . 
 however , no significant differences were observed in the survival to the hospital discharge ( rr = 1.35 , 95% ci : 0.872.10 , p = 0.18 ) , favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge ( rr = 1.53 , 95% ci : 0.952.45 , p = 0.08 ) and adverse events.conclusions:the meta - analysis demonstrated that mild hypothermia can improve the survival rate and neurological function of patients with cardiac arrest after 6 months . on the other hand , regarding the survival to hospital discharge , favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge , and adverse events , our meta - analysis produced nonsignificant results .",pubmed
"idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( ihh ) refers to gonadal dysgenesis due to deficiency of gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( gnrh ) release from the hypothalamus . 
 the prevalence of ihh is about 1/10,000 in men and 1/50,000 in women with a m / f ratio of 4 - 5  :  1 . 
 since ihh is rare , the number of ihh patients is small in any one geographical area . 
 it is often difficult for a single clinical center to perform comprehensive assessment of the disease due to the limited number of cases . 
 internationally , large - scale clinical studies on this rare disease are usually conducted in the form of multicenter trials . however , these kinds of studies are time consuming and require large amount of resources as well as close coordination among study groups . with the advances in information technology in the recent years , people have utilized networks for different research purposes . by december 2011 , 
 the number of internet users in china had exceeded five hundred million . with more wide - spread availability of networks and the dramatic increase in the number of internet users , 
 they form disease - specific social groups to share their knowledge and experience spontaneously , which makes it possible for medical researchers to conduct medical research through networks [ 3 , 5 ] . 
 network investigation is a new modality of means of medical research that can cover large populations with low investigation costs , especially for investigation of a rare disease in a particular network social group 
 . it can collect large numbers of clinical cases within a short period for the research purpose . in the present study , we collected the clinical data of ihh patients in china by interviewing ihh patients through network questionnaire and their medical records . 
 we compared the obtained data with those reported in previous studies in the literature for the purpose of improving our understanding , diagnosis , and treatment of ihh . 
 the kallmann liangjian social group is the largest ihh social networking group in china ( qq as the real - time network communication tool , id7685615 ) with 103 members . 
 the items of the questionnaire investigation were designed by endocrinologists on the basis of the data obtained from literatures of ihh in china and abroad . 
 the information obtained through the questionnaire survey includes the following : demographic characteristics , family history , age , clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at onset of disease , particular therapeutic protocols ( testosterone ( t ) , human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) , human menopausal gonadotropin ( hmg ) , luteinizing - hormone - releasing hormone ( lhrh ) , or random combination of them ) , developmental stage of the testis and secondary sex characteristics , sexual function , level of sexual hormones , and quality - of - life ( qol ) rating . using the tanner classification pictures 
 , patients made a self - assessment of the development of the external genital organs , pubic hair , and breasts . 
 self - reported data was referred to the same standard , while the laboratory examination results and disease diagnosis were actually obtained from medical records . 
 online questionnaire survey submission included electronic consent as part of the website log - on process . 
 this study was approved by the institutional review board of huashan hospital in shanghai , china . 
 a total of 75 questionnaires answering all of the 64 questions were obtained online between october 2011 and march 2012 . 
 all of the participants were asked to provide copies of their medical records ; then , the records were examined by one endocrinologist , and only ihh patients were allowed to join the qq group . all activities and exchanges involved in the investigation were voluntary and free of charge . 
 participants can submit the questionnaire survey only after all of the 64 questions were answered ; thus , there was no missing data for the investigation . 
 all participants had to hand in their medical records for ihh and provide their contact means such as the e - mail address and telephone number , so that the investigators could check whether or not the information that the participants provided was authentic . 
 finally , the computer system generated tables automatically , and the investigated data were stored in the data bank directly . 
 differences between categorical variable groups were compared by chi - square test or bilateral probability of fisher 's exact test . 
 scores for overall qol and correlations of clinical parameters were analyzed by spearman 's correlation analysis . 
 all of the 74 patients participating in the ihh investigation were males with the mean age being 27.3  3.4 years ( ranging from 20 to 35 years ) . 
 the mean age at disease onset was 15.2  6.6 years , and the duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 25 years with a mean of 12.1  7.2 years . 
 the height of the 74 patients ranged from 157 to 188  cm with a mean of 174.4  6.9  cm . 
 ( mean : 24.27  3.73  kg / m ) , belonging to overweight ( bmi of 24  kg / m is used as cutoff point for the chinese adults to define overweight ) . 
 of the 74 patients , 28 ( 37.8% ) patients had a history of smoking ( 2 cigarettes per day on average ) . 
 all patients had junior middle school or higher education level , 25 ( 33.8% ) patients had senior middle school education , and 37 ( 50% ) patients had college education . 
 all the 74 patients were diagnosed with ihh , and 84% of them were diagnosed in general hospitals , 13.5% in district hospitals , and 2.7% in community hospitals . 
 42 ( 56.8% ) patients were diagnosed and treated in endocrinology unit , 25 ( 33.5% ) patients in urinary surgery unit , and 6 ( 8.1% ) patients in pediatrics unit . 
 of the 74 patients , 38 ( 51.4% ) patients had hyposmia or anosmia , and 69 ( 93.2% ) patients presented with obvious pubertal delay . 
 the serum testosterone levels at disease onset were decreased with varying degrees in all of the 74 patients , as the medical reference ranges in different laboratories are different . 
 serum follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) levels were decreased in 71 ( 95.9% ) patients , and serum luteinizing hormone ( lh ) levels were decreased in 69 ( 93.2% ) patients . of the 74 patients , 68 patients received hormone replacement therapy , and the therapeutic protocols are shown in table 1 . 
 20 ( 27.0% ) patients had cryptorchidism , and 11 patients received  cryptorchidism surgery . 
 except for the family history , there was no significant difference in gender composition , age , bmi , testosterone level at disease onset , pubertal development , small penis , testicular volume , breast enlargement , cryptorchidism , and number of patients receiving  cryptorchidism surgery  between the populations in our study and the study reported by the reproductive endocrine unit of massachusetts general hospital   ( table 2 ) , while , in one multicenter study from england , more patients had family history of ihh , and the testicular volumes of ihh patients are smaller than those in our study . in the 74 patients , the mean length of the penis before erection was 3.98  1.73  cm , and the mean testicular volume was 4.11  2.12  ml . 
 based on the tanner classification criteria , there are 38 patients at genital development stage i and 36 patients at stage ii , and nobody was at stage iii , iv , or v. there are 46 patients at pubic hair development stage i and 28 patients at stage ii , and nobody was at stage iii , iv , or v. all of the 74 patients had no or small laryngeal prominence and no or sparse facial hair including 12 ( 16.2% ) patients with small laryngeal prominence and 9 ( 12.2% ) with sparse beard . 
 of the 74 patients , only 27 ( 36.5% ) patients had the male erection function , and 8 ( 10.8% ) patients had physiological nocturnal spermatorrhea . among the 68 patients who received hormone replacement therapy , 
 for example , they had more masculine body , more facial hair and pubic hair , larger laryngeal prominence , more developed external genital organs , larger penis and scrotum , stronger erections , and nocturnal spermatorrhea . 
 there was significant difference in penis length , testicular volume , development of external genital organs , pubic hair , beard , laryngeal prominence , penis erection , and spermatorrhea before and after treatment ( p < 0.001 , table 3 ) . 
 the normalization of testosterone level rose from 0% before treatment to 66.2% after treatment , excluding 3 patients who are now receiving exogenous testosterone therapy . 
 of the 74 patients , 38 ( 51.4% ) patients now have sexual activities , including 14 ( 18.9% ) patients whose spouses became pregnant . 
 thirty - seven patients who received hcg or hcg + hmg treatment were included into a single gonadotropin group ( g group ) , and 25 patients who received hcg + t or hcg + hmg + t treatment were included into a gonadotropin + androgen replacement group ( g + a group ) . 
 those who were still receiving testosterone replacement therapy were excluded from the g + a group , and the remaining 22 patients who once received testosterone replacement therapy discontinued its use for 18 years ( mean : 4.5  2.6 years ) . 
 there was no significant difference in age at the time of investigation , age at disease onset , testosterone level before treatment , and decrease rate of fsh and lh between g group and g + a group . 
 it was found that g + a group was significantly superior to g group in terms of penis length , pubic hair , laryngeal prominence development , and normalization of testosterone level ( p < 0.05 , table 3 ) . compared with g group , 
 g + a group also exhibited more improvement in testicular volume , genital organs , beard , and spermatorrhea , though the difference was not statistically significant . 
 qol of the ihh patients was assessed with respect to physical strength , appetite , sleep , libido , and sense of happiness . 
 the mean score of physical strength was 5.1  1.7 , that of appetite was 7.3  1.8 , that of sleep was 6.8    2.3 , that of libido was 7.2  2.0 , and that of sense of happiness was 5.7  2.6 . 
 the overall qol scored was 1045 , and the mean value was 32.1  7.5 . 
 the ihh patients reported that they still felt poor in the sense of happiness and physical strength after treatment . 
 there was a significant difference in the physical strength score between g group and g + a group ( 5.40  0.36 versus 4.65  0.30 , p = 0.025 ) , while there was no significant difference in appetite , sleep , libido , and sense of happiness . 
 the overall qol score of the ihh patients was positively correlated with the level of testicular volume ( r = 0.324 ;  p = 0.005 ) and the developmental state of the external genital organs ( r = 0.281 ; p = 0.015 ) after treatment . 
 the most unique characteristic of the present study is the utilization of a web - based disease - specific social networking group for our investigation . to the best of our knowledge , 
 the continuous expansion of internet users provides a good foundation for the development of network investigation , a new approach for medical research in china and elsewhere . 
 there had been multiple studies comparing network studies with conventional studies , and they found that there was no significant difference in the study population characteristics and statistical results [ 11 , 12 ] . 
 table 2 shows that the results obtained in the present network investigation are similar to those reported in the literature   with respect to sex , age , bmi , and clinical characteristics of the ihh patients , which further confirms that group data obtained from network investigation are representative . however , ihh patients in the study reported no family history , which may be related to the age and sporadic characteristics of the patients . 
 the patients ' parents did not have ihh , or else they would not have offspring as there was no domestic treatment method for ihh several decades ago . 
 this finding is consistent with those of the previous large - sample studies on ihh in china . 
 ( 1 ) it can include more participants , especially when network investigation is directed at a particular disease - specific social group . 
 in addition , it is not restricted by time , space , or location ( i.e. , a single medical center ) , so that more patients with different severities and courses of the disease distributed in different regions of china or around the world can be investigated , and , therefore , the data obtained are more representative . 
 ( 2 ) information can be obtained more quickly and conveniently , because network investigation saves amount of time in patient recruitment . in this study 
 , we only spent five months to collect the data of the 74 ihh patients compared with 20 years for the massachusetts general hospital . 
 in addition , network questionnaire investigation has a quick response rate , and the data obtained can be imported into the data bank directly , thus saving time , material , and manpower and reducing the cost of research effectively as compared with the conventional research methods . ( 
 network investigation can be completed in a relatively independent situation , devoid of external interferences , so that the patients are able to express freely their sexual function and other private information [ 3 , 15 ] . 
 network investigation can be carried out by a relatively small and independent research team , and any clinician can conduct the research as long as he / she has a reasonable study design . 
 although network investigation is a new method for medical research and carries many advantages , it has some disadvantages . 
 ( 1 ) as only network users can participate in the study , there may be some bias in patients selection . 
 the participants need to be able to get on networks and have a certain education level . 
 ( 2 ) network investigation has to use the layman 's language for communication , and , therefore , it is not suitable for studies that strongly depend on medical terminology . 
 prolonged sex hormone deficiency may otherwise produce adverse effects on the development , metabolism , and psychology . 
 all treated patients reported their improvements in the penis , testis , external genital organs , pubic hair , beard , laryngeal prominence development , erection , spermatorrhea , and testosterone normalization . 
 these findings are basically consistent with those of the previous studies of us massachusetts general hospital and uk manchester royal infirmary [ 8 , 19 ] . 
 more than 50% of the patients in this study have regained their sexual function after treatment , and part of the patients ' spouses have got pregnant . 
 the possible reason is that most of the ihh patients in our study were overweight ; with physical development of the body and accumulation of the adipose tissue , the breasts became larger , which made self - assessment of the mammary development according to the tanner classification criteria difficult . 
 for this reason , ultrasonography should be used to evaluate mammary gland development more accurately . 
 in addition , as the physical strength of ihh patients is generally weak and the sense of happiness is usually low , it is necessary to provide psychosocial support to ihh patients . 
 unfortunately , there is a lack of such studies in both china and other countries . in the present study 
 , we interestingly found that the therapeutic effect in g + a group was superior to that in g group with respect to the penis length , pubic hair growth , testosterone normalization rate , and self - assessment scores of physical strength . 
 the testosterone normalization rate in the g + a group ( excluding the three patients who were still receiving testosterone replacement therapy in the recent three months ) was significantly higher than that in g group ( 90.9% versus 51.7% ) , indicating that improvement of the clinical symptoms in g + a group was not due to the immediate exogenous testosterone treatment but due to the therapeutic effect of the testosterone treatment that they previously received . whether exogenous testosterone replacement therapy is beneficial to 
 the response of ihh patients to gonadotropin therapy remains inconclusive , but the report from harvard reproductive endocrine sciences center seems to support this . 
 the conditions of ihh can be reversed in about 10% of the patients , and all of these reversed cases received androgen replacement therapy , although the course of treatment may vary from individual to individual . 
 therefore , they postulated that androgen may be able to improve the plasticity of the brain nerve network in generating gnrh , thus promoting reversal of the ihh condition . 
 androgen has been found in regulating the generation of neurons in human olfactory epithelium , olfactory bulb , and hippocampal dentate gyrus and maintaining a normal number of neuronal synapses . in our investigation 
 , 62/68 patients received exogenous hcg and/or hmg therapy , and the feedback inhibition of exogenous testosterone does not exist , while only 6 patients receiving lhrh may be mildly influenced . 
 another simple reason is that the hcg dose may not have been adequately titrated up , so androgen was being used as a kind of  top - up  therapy to increase spermatogenesis efficiency and fertility in the males . 
 similar to a recent study , recombinant fsh pretreatment followed by gnrh is successful in inducing testicular growth and fertility in men with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with prepubertal testes . 
 the mechanism(s ) for the more favorable clinical outcome of g + a treatment over the simple g treatment can not be elucidated in the present study . 
 however , the phenomenon of  ihh reversal  as observed by harvard reproductive endocrine sciences center suggests that testosterone treatment may improve the therapeutic effect of gonadotropin through an unknown pathway or mechanism in a particular stage . 
 future randomized controlled clinical trials and mechanistic studies are needed before any definitive conclusions can be made . in conclusion 
 , disease - specific network investigation can be used as an alternative method of medical research , although its effectiveness needs to be further verified . in the present study , we made use of the network information technology to conduct an investigation on ihh and found that hormone replacement therapy could improve the conditions of ihh patients effectively . 
 in addition , the commonly used gonadotropin + androgen therapy appears to be superior to androgen replacement alone , although the actual clinical significance needs to be confirmed in prospective randomized control studies .","idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( ihh ) is a rare condition in which puberty does not take place naturally . 
 we aimed to develop and follow an internet - based cohort and to improve our understanding of the disease . 
 we established an internet - based questionnaire survey . 
 a total of 74 male ihh patients were recruited from the chinese largest ihh network social group . 
 the clinical symptoms before treatment mainly included small testis , underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics , and sexual dysfunction . after treatment , 
 the penis length , testicular volume , external genital organ development , pubic hair , beard , laryngeal prominence , erection , and spermatorrhea were improved significantly ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 18.9% of the patients completed fertility ; however , more than half of the patients still complained of poor happiness and low physical strength . 
 in addition , improvements in penis and pubic hair development , testosterone normalization and the physical strength in ihh patients who received gonadotropin and androgen replacement therapy were better than in those who received single gonadotropin therapy ( p < 0.05 for all ) . in conclusion 
 , disease - specific network investigation can be used as an alternative method of medical research for rare diseases . 
 the results of our cross - sectional study showed the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for ihh and implied that gonadotropin and androgen replacement therapy may be superior to gonadotropin treatment alone .",pubmed
"the control of appetite is complex and involves the coordination of inputs from both physiological and environmental sources . 
 early theoretical approaches were based on the idea that the control mechanism was dedicated exclusively to signals from glucose metabolism , amino acids or proteins , or adipose tissue . respectively , 
 these formed the glucostatic ( mayer , 1955 ) , aminostatic ( mellinkoff et al . , 1956 ) and lipostatic ( kennedy , 1953 ) hypotheses . 
 more recent central nervous system models have emphasised inputs from adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract [ along with input from sensory features of food ( e.g. schwartz and morton , 2001 ; keesey and powley , 2008 ) ] . 
 the major signals include leptin from adipose tissue , and hormones such as ghrelin , pyy , glucagon - like peptide 1 ( glp-1 ) , cholecystokinin ( cck ) , amylin and insulin from specialised cells in the gi tract or associated organs . 
 such models are said to account for the regulation of appetite and , in turn , contribute to the regulation of body weight , through the identification of specific molecular signals carrying information from the periphery to a network of pathways centred on the hypothalamus . 
 interest in this type of formulation strengthened during the period when molecular biology began to take over from integrative physiology as an explanatory approach in biological sciences . 
 the major task facing any model of human appetite regulation is to account for the ongoing and recurring drive to eat , together with the intermittent suppression of eating via episodic satiety signalling and tonic inhibition ( halford and blundell , 2000 ) . in this commentary 
 , we outline the basis of a new formulation that explains how aspects of body composition and energy expenditure ( ee ) regulate hunger and appetite . 
 this formulation is based on 15 years of psychobiological research with overweight and obese human subjects , and should help to contribute to understanding the relative impact of biological and environmental cues on body weight . 
 an alternative to the molecular approach to appetite control has arisen from the study of energy balance : the inter - relationships between ee and energy intake ( ei ) . in part , this view stems from the statement that any increase in ee will be met with an equivalent increase in ei ( mayer et al . , 1956 ) . 
 indeed , it was proposed that  the differences between the intakes of food [ of individuals ] must originate in differences in the expenditure of energy 
 edholm s experimental studies , however , revealed no correlation between ee and ei in any one single day , but there was a good correlation over 2 weeks . 
 the lack of any relation in a day is perhaps not surprising , because any episode of ee ( such as work or exercise ) happening towards the end of the day would not leave time for a balancing effect of eating . moreover , daily ee can fluctuate markedly from day to day according to individual behavioural tendencies . 
 by contrast , resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) is the largest component of total daily ee and is quite uniform across the day and between days ( johnstone et al . , 2005 ; johnstone et al . , 2006 ; ravussin et al , 1982 ) , and 
 it is plausible that ee from rmr could provide a tonic signal of energy demand that could act as a driver of daily ei . 
 by contrast , physical activity ee ( being of greater intensity and sporadic ) would be expected to exert a mechanistically different type of control over appetite . 
 exercise can raise resting values of ee several fold depending on the volume , mode and intensity . 
 in addition , the effect of exercise on various body systems means that it will have numerous physiological effects in addition to an increase in ee . 
 such effects include an overall increase in heart rate , and changes in the distribution of blood flow , sympathetic nervous system activity , gut hormone activity and in the absorption of nutrients . 
 therefore , it might be anticipated that there could be a number of separate effects on mechanisms influencing appetite . 
 in addition , it can be presumed that a single acute bout of exercise would have different effects from continued daily sessions of exercise that would exert an increasing cumulative challenge to energy balance . 
 a comprehensive picture therefore requires a comparison between various intensities of exercise over varying periods of time with measurement , wherever possible , of all variables in the energy budget . a central issue underlying the investigation of exercise is to determine [ as mayer proposed ( mayer et al . , 1956 ) ] whether or not exercise inevitably induces a compensatory response characterised by an increase in hunger  and in turn food intake  that would lead to an increase in ei that is sufficient to balance the increase in ee generated by exercise . over the last 15 years , we have developed an experimental platform based on a psychobiological approach and incorporating a multi - level system ( caudwell et al . 
 this has allowed the disclosure of relationships between variables in the domains of body composition [ fat free mass ( ffm ) , fat mass ( fm ) ] , metabolism ( rmr , respiratory quotient , respiratory exchange ratio ) , gi hormones , food composition , psychological sensations , food behaviour , psychometric traits , nutritional composition and allelic variation in a single cohort of overweight and obese subjects . in summary , we find that acute ( single ) bouts of exercise do not lead to a consistent increase in the average food intake in the immediate post - exercise period or in the following 24 hours ( for reviews see blundell and king , 1998 ; martins et al . , 2007 ) 
 . however , there is considerable variability associated with appetite variables ( finlayson et al . , 2009 ) . 
 as exercise sessions are repeated over periods varying from 9 to 16 days , a partial compensatory response begins to appear ( stubbs et al . 
 there seems to be little or no compensation through a decrease in non - exercise - related activity ( turner et al . 
 when exercise was performed daily over a period of 16 days and total ee was measured using the doubly labelled water method , it was calculated that exercise raised average daily ee by 3.5 mj and generated a 30% compensation in ei ( whybrow et al . , 2008 ) . 
 several other studies have measured the impact of different exercise prescriptions over periods of 12 to 32 weeks ( church et al . 
 a typical 12-week study using overweight and obese men and women showed that exercise caused an average weight loss of 3.3 kg , indicating that the exercise ee was not fully compensated ( king et al . , 2008 ) , but individual variability was very large [ also observed in other studies ( church et al . 
 a key feature of this study was that exercise sessions ( five times per week for 12 weeks ) was fully supervised and the ee measured so as to rule out the possibility of the outcome being influenced by lack of compliance . 
 subsequent investigations indicated a dual action of exercise on appetite control that partly explained the large variation in body weight change . 
 the exercise caused a significant increase in fasting levels of hunger ( a compensatory response ) , but this was highly variable between subjects . 
 however , there was an associated increase in the post - prandial satiety signalling from meals , indicated by a change in the satiety quotient ( green et al . , 1997 ; king et al . 
 consequently , the effect of exercise on appetite comprises two components : one generating a tonic stimulation of appetite and the other a counteractive meal - related episodic inhibition . 
 the second response seems to be related to changes in either the release of , or sensitivity to , gi peptides ( broom et al . , 2007 ; martins et al . , 2010 ) . 
 these effects of exercise - related ee on appetite are likely to be quite different from any effect related to the lower intensity and more uniform tonic action of rmr . 
 using the multi - level experimental platform described above ( caudwell et al . , 2011 ) , it has been possible to observe the relationships between variables in separate domains ( biological , nutritional , behavioural , metabolic ) , all measured objectively and to similar degrees of accuracy . 
 importantly , the measurements have been made simultaneously in the same group of overweight and obese people . 
 this has enabled the disclosure of unexpected associations between body composition and appetite . a little more than 10 years ago , the discovery of leptin was decisive in focussing attention on adipose tissue as a major controller of energy balance ( ei and ee ) . 
 several models of appetite regulation have described the role of leptin ( as a signal from adipose tissue ) in influencing hypothalamic neuropeptide pathways that control the stimulation and inhibition of food intake ( morton and schwartz , 2001 ; badman and flier , 2005 ) . with most attention 
 directed to the role of adipose tissue ( or fm ) , it can be considered that ffm has become the  forgotten variable , even though it is clearly important under some conditions ( dulloo et al . , 1997 ) . 
 it is therefore interesting that detailed analysis of body composition and appetite variables using the multi - level platform have demonstrated that ffm , but not fm or body mass index ( bmi ) , is strongly correlated with meal size and daily ei ( blundell et al . 
 the strong implication of this relationship is that some privileged molecules arising from ffm , or some physiological consequences that reflect the activity of ffm , act as a signal to drive food intake . 
 considering total daily ee , it is noticeable that rmr is its largest component ( 5070% ) , of which ffm is the major contributor , accounting for about 6070% , whereas fm accounts for as little as 57% , with gender and age being minor components ( johnstone et al . , 2005 ) . 
 consequently , it is plausible that rmr could act as a mediating variable to reflect the influence of ffm on appetite control . 
 accordingly , in a series of analyses  based on the multilevel platform described earlier  we have demonstrated that rmr is positively associated with meal size and with daily ee ( note that the relationship between rmr and total daily ei mirrors the relationship between ffm and total daily ei , which is shown in fig . 
 in addition , rmr is also a predictor of fasting levels of hunger and influences the profile of hunger across the day ( illustrated by fig . 
 the strong implication of these relationships is that rmr  as a measure of ee  reflects a physiological demand for energy that acts as a  driver of food intake . 
 this is plausible and constitutes a demonstration of edholm s proposal that differences in food intake must originate in the differences in energy expenditure ( edholm et al . , 1955 ) . although edholm did not demonstrate a relationship between ei and the ( highly variable ) total daily ee ( within any single day ) , we have demonstrated a clear relationship with the more stable and uniform factor of rmr . 
 the existence of a relationship ( within a single day ) between rmr and daily ee would depend on the total volume and intensity of the  discretionary physical activity component of ee , and upon the relative strengths of the dual processes of appetite control generated by exercise ( see above ) . 
 most recent models of appetite regulation have drawn attention to the roles for adipose tissue and gi peptides . however , these models are better able to account for the inhibition of eating rather than its initiation . 
 the models embody the view that tonic and episodic inhibitory factors modulate an  intrinsic orexigenic drive to eat . 
 this endogenous drive is not usually well defined . however , in early theorising about appetite control , equal emphasis was given to the inhibitory and excitatory ( drive ) features of appetite . 
 the latter was conceptualised as morgan s  central motive state ( morgan , 1943 ) , and in stellar s embodiment of this in an excitatory centre in the hypothalamus ( stellar , 1954 ) . 
 one major issue was to explain what gave animals ( including humans ) the energy and direction that motivated food seeking . in light of knowledge about the physiology of homeostasis , 
 it is plausible that a drive for food arises from the energy used to maintain physiological and metabolic functioning of the body . 
 this resonates with the proposal of edholm ( edholm et al . , 1955 ) , and represents a merging of parallel thinking from psychobiologists working on animal behaviour and physiologists working on human energy balance . 
 together with modern ( post - leptin ) discoveries , it can be suggested that the physiology of appetite regulation comprises three components : a tonic drive for food arising from the physiological demand for energy ; a tonic inhibition arising from signals of energy storage ( mainly adipose tissue ) ; and episodic signals arising from the mouth and gi tract in response to the periodic consumption of food . 
 this last category is primarily inhibitory  from the classical satiety signals  but also excitatory ( signals registering food palatability ) . 
 ( a ) scatter plot shows the relationship between ffm and daily ei in a group of 41 overweight or obese men and women . 
 the values represent the average values from objective measures taken at specific probe days at weeks 0 , 6 and 12 . 
 ( b ) daily hunger profiles for individuals with the highest ffms ( eight women and five men ) and those with the lowest ffms ( eight women and five men ) . 
 the groups were formed by dividing the whole sample into tertiles of ffm and comparing the upper and lower tertiles ( but keeping similar numbers of men and women in each tertile ) . 
 the difference between the area under the curve for the two profiles is significant ( p<0.01 ) ; asterisks indicate time points at which the profiles are significantly different . 
 the profiles indicate that hunger in the high ffm group is greater before the onset of a meal and in the period leading up to the meal , but not at the end of the meal . 
 this is consistent with the fact that the high ffm individuals eat a larger meal , which would return hunger to a level appropriate for full satiation . 
 together , data displayed in a and b indicate that ffm is positively associated with daily ei and with daily hunger levels . 
 additionally , because rmr is highly and significantly correlated with ffm , the relationships between rmr , ei and hunger very closely match those for ffm shown in the figure . 
 hunger is measured in units on a 100 unit scale on the screen of a hand - held pda . 
 the investigations reviewed here have provided evidence for the physiological drive for food by demonstrating a specific association of ffm , but not fm , with objectively measured food intake variables ( blundell et al . , 2012 ) . 
 in turn , this means that the energy required to maintain the body s lean tissue mass  thus preventing wasting  creates a physiological demand that determines a minimal level of ei at meals and over the day . 
 it is worth noting that the relationship between ffm and ei is consistent with the amino - static hypothesis put forward more than 50 years ago by mellinkoff et al . 
 ( mellinkoff et al . , 1956 ) , and with the more detailed proposal of a role for the protein - stat mechanism described by millward ( millward , 1995 ) . a new formulation for appetite control . a proposed tonic signal for the drive to eat that reflects the body s demand for energy arises ( mainly ) from ffm and rmr 
 in turn , this drive is under tonic inhibition from leptin , whose action reflects the amount of stored energy reserves in the body . as the amount of adipose tissue increases , leptin insensitivity occurs and this tonic inhibition is reduced . 
 the drive to eat is periodically interrupted and suppressed by episodic signals in the form of peptides that are released from the gi tract in response to food consumption . 
 the resulting pattern of eating is a consequence of the interactions between tonic and episodic physiological signals . 
 prolonged exercise displays a dual - process action by stimulating hunger ( an effect that is highly variable between individuals ) but also by increasing post - prandial satiety signalling ( king et al . 
 , 2009 ) through an effect on gi peptides ( martins et al . , 2010 ) . 
 a further step in the formulation comes from the demonstration that rmr is also strongly correlated with objectively measured self - determined ei ( caudwell et al . , 
 this could be expected from the recognition that ffm is the largest contributor to rmr ( accounting for approximately 60% in our studies ) . 
 it is worth noting that ee arising from ffm receives contributions from the liver ( 20% ) , brain ( 20% ) , heart ( 11% ) , gi tract ( 9% ) and skeletal muscle ( 20% ) ( elia , 1992 ) . 
 therefore , the physiological demand is created by the need to provide energy to maintain the functioning of the body s vital systems . moreover 
 , the ee from these organ systems is maintained across the day and is reflected in the relative stability and uniformity of rmr within and between days . 
 consequently , the proposal that rmr acts as a  physiological drive ( or is a marker of such a drive ) underlying appetite is both parsimonious and plausible . 
 this formulation is quite consistent with those models of appetite regulation that assign major roles to adipose tissue and the gi tract . 
 however , it also draws attention to other aspects of body composition as determinants of appetite . combined with other findings , 
 this interpretation provides mechanistic explanations for the link between ffm , rmr and eating behaviour . 
 this formulation can incorporate an extended role for leptin and is in keeping with a widening ergostatic function of additional adipokinetic hormones in energy homeostasis , as envisaged by frhbeck and gmez - ambrosi ( frhbeck and gmez - ambrosi , 2001 ) . 
 the idea of ffm creating an orexigenic or ergostatic drive has also been proposed in other descriptions of the appetite regulatory system ( halford and blundell , 2000 ) . 
 adipokines exert effects not only on adipose tissue but also on skeletal muscle ( sinz et al . , 2009 ) , and that differential expression of genes and pathways that are intrinsic to skeletal muscle might also be involved ( wu et al . , 2011 ) . 
 consequently , it can be envisaged that leptin could act as a major tonic inhibitory signal ( to dampen the physiological drive ) and also as an energostatic factor through its influence on ffm . 
 the proposal that ffm and rmr contribute to a physiological demand for energy that influences appetite is plausible and has implications . 
 first , it is one further reason to be dissatisfied with the use of measures of body weight ( or bmi ) in the research and management of obesity . 
 the recognition that ffm and fm have different functional properties in relation to appetite is a strong reason to use body composition ( rather than the coarse variable of body weight ) in both the research and management of obesity . 
 for example , two individuals with similar bmis ( or body mass ) might have quite different proportions of ffm and fm , and this would confer different properties on their physiological and behavioural responses . those people with a high ffm should have a proportionately higher orexigenic drive to maintain a greater minimal meal intake ( i.e. they should eat more ) than people with less lean tissues and organs . 
 this means that obese people ( with a greater lean mass in support of a large amount of adipose tissue ) and people carrying a large muscle mass ( field athletes , rugby players , swimmers , etc . ) should have a stronger tendency to consume larger meals than smaller people . 
 it follows that such people would have greater difficulty in tolerating dietary restriction ( because the more energetically active lean mass would sustain a drive for a minimal amount of food ) . 
 moreover , in elderly people subject to sarcopenia , the reduced lean mass would result in a diminished appetite . 
 however , it should not be inferred that the influence of ffm and rmr upon food intake is a cause of weight gain or obesity . 
 this mechanism is a physiological way of achieving energy balance ( ensuring that ei does not fall below the energy demand of the body ) . as such , 
 the mechanism influences the strength of the drive to eat ( feeding behaviour ) and determines the level of hunger at the beginning of a meal ( fig . 
 the amount of energy that is actually consumed is strongly modulated by the energy density of the food available ( ello - martin et al . 
 , 2005 ; rolls , 2000 ) . high energy density of food results in passive overconsumption ( blundell and macdiarmid , 1997 ) , which has been identified as a major component of the obesogenic environment ( swinburn et al . , 2011 ) . 
 consequently , a high rmr could influence weight gain by maintaining a high level of hunger , but a positive energy balance would depend on the energy density and palatability of the diet . 
 this is an example of a physiological regulatory process being undermined by the nature of the modern diet in many technologically advanced countries . in turn 
 , the formulation proposed here can help to promote research to clarify the relative strength of biological and environmental variables that contribute to ei and to changes in body weight ( and body composition ) . 
 moreover , we envisage that the system would adapt to progressive changes that occur in body composition over time and could influence energy balance ( e.g. hall et al . , 
 the most likely scenario is that any increase in ffm ( and rmr ) would increase the drive to eat . 
 this amplifying effect on ei would mean that weight gain becomes part of a positive , rather than a negative , feedback system . 
 increasing body weight therefore could facilitate further weight gain and increase the difficulty of weight loss or maintenance .","a long - running issue in appetite research concerns the influence of energy expenditure on energy intake . 
 more than 50 years ago , otto g. edholm proposed that  the differences between the intakes of food [ of individuals ] must originate in differences in the expenditure of energy  . 
 however , a relationship between energy expenditure and energy intake within any one day could not be found , although there was a correlation over 2 weeks . 
 this issue was never resolved before interest in integrative biology was replaced by molecular biochemistry . using a psychobiological approach , 
 we have studied appetite control in an energy balance framework using a multi - level experimental system on a single cohort of overweight and obese human subjects . 
 this has disclosed relationships between variables in the domains of body composition [ fat - free mass ( ffm ) , fat mass ( fm ) ] , metabolism , gastrointestinal hormones , hunger and energy intake . in this commentary , we review our own and other data , and discuss a new formulation whereby appetite control and energy intake are regulated by energy expenditure . specifically , we propose that ffm ( the largest contributor to resting metabolic rate ) , but not body mass index or fm , is closely associated with self - determined meal size and daily energy intake . 
 this formulation has implications for understanding weight regulation and the management of obesity .",pubmed
"major depression ( md ) is the main cause of disability and the fourth - leading contributor to the global burden of disease . by the year 2020 
 , md is projected to reach second place in the ranking of disability - adjusted life years . 
 trials of available antidepressant medications alone or combined with psychotherapies are effective for 60%80% of those affected with md.1 conversely , up to 40% of patients with md do not show satisfactory improvement attributable to multiple biopsychosocial factors . at its worst 
 , md can lead to suicide , and as a consequence about 850,000 lives are lost every year.2 treatment - resistant depression ( trd ) evades universal definition ; however , a poor response to two adequate ( optimal dosage and 612 weeks duration ) trials of two different classes of antidepressants has been proposed as its operational characterization.3 researchers have categorized trd in accordance to antidepressant trials : stage 0 , has not had a single adequate trial of medication ; stage 1 , failure of an adequate trial of one class of an antidepressant that is monotherapy ; stage 2 , failure of adequate trials of two distinctly different classes  that is , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) and tricyclic antidepressants  of antidepressant , involving two monotherapy trials ; stage 3 , stage 2 plus failure to respond to one augmentation strategy of lithium or thyroid augmentation of one of the monotherapies ; stage 4 , stage 3 plus a failure to a second augmentation strategy in terms of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ; and stage 5 , stage 4 plus failure of an adequate course of ect.4 there are other staging methods of trd.5 these staging methods help researchers and clinicians to understand trd patients and accordingly plan interventions for enhancing the response , remission rate , and quality of life 
 . however , trd continues to challenge mental health care providers despite the understanding of psychosocial and biological markers and psychopharmacology of mood disorders and also the availability of multiple therapeutic options including optimization , switching , and combination of antidepressants . 
 notably , currently there is an increasing interest in the utilization of several neuromodulation therapies ( nts ) in the management of patients with trd.6 this is because psychopharmacological therapy exposes the entire body to a potentially therapeutic substance in order to treat a relatively small region of the brain , whereas nts are designed to target specific brain circuits that are important in the pathogenesis of md . 
 additionally , nts are not systemic and , therefore , the side - effect profile is limited and different from medications , and there are minimal , if any , drug interactions.7 furthermore , evidence - based data has been emerging continuously about fda - approved and yet - to - be - approved nts in the trd population over the past decade . 
 multiple computer searches were conducted using pubmed , google scholar , quertle(r ) , and medline databases for the years 20002012 . 
 a number of keywords were used : treatment - resistant depression , treatment - refractory depression , partial - response depression , nonresponse depression , neuromodulation techniques , neurostimulation approaches , and somatic therapies . 
 these words were combined with modified electroconvulsive therapy ( mect ) , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rtms ) , vagus nerve stimulation ( vns ) , magnetic seizure therapy ( mst ) , deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) , transcranial direct current stimulation , cranial electric stimulation ( ces ) , epidural cortical stimulation ( ecs ) , focused ultrasound ( fus ) , near - infrared light therapy ( nir ) , low - field magnetic stimulation ( lfms ) , and optogenetic stimulation ( os ) for a second round of computer searches . a third round of searches included words such as mechanisms , 
 brain areas involved , and outcomes combined with aforesaid therapies . as a corollary , relevant articles published in english - language peer - reviewed journals were retrieved . 
 only clinical trials , systematic reviews , and meta - analyses that addressed trd and nts were retained for extensive review and inclusion in this study . 
 some exceptions were made with regard to some unique case reports , open and controlled studies , and small and large case series describing usefulness of nts in patients with trd and md . 
 similarly , studies focusing on neurosurgical ablation approaches in trd populations were not considered for inclusion . 
 references of selected articles were also reviewed for identifying relevant trd trials , which were also included in this review . 
 nts for neuropsychiatric disorders including md are categorized into the following : ( 1 ) seizure therapies , including mect and mst , ( 2 ) noninvasive therapies , including rtms , tdcs , and ces , ( 3 ) neurosurgical approaches , including vns , ecs , and dbs , and ( 4 ) new approaches on the horizon , including fus , nir , lfms , and os.8 another category represents neurosurgical ablation therapies , including cingulotomy and limbic leucotomy used in trd . 
 such technical details as invasiveness , anesthesia needed , seizures induced , target related to deep brain structures , contactness , stimulation being focal or generalized and form of stimulation of each neuromodulation therapy are presented in table 1 . 
 there is an increasing focus on exploring biomarkers underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders9 that help in the development of new drugs and nts . in several related studies , overactive subcallosal cingulate gyrus ( scg ) 
 glucose metabolism has been reported in md that is reduced with successful antidepressant therapies.10 interestingly , dbs is reported to modulate neural pathways linked with scg in relieving md.8,11,12 according to some studies , antidepressant effects were also found when dbs targeted ventral capsule / ventral striatum ( vc / vs ) in patients with severe obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) and md.13,14 in a study of single patients with dystonia suffering from depression , dbs of globus pallidus internus ( gpi ) showed improvement in dystonia but also showed antidepressant effects through modulation of mesolimbic dopamine pathways.15 in another study , also of single patients with tardive dyskinesia ( td ) and md , dbs brought about improvement in depressive mood.16 other studies have also reported improvement in both depression and td after dbs of the inferior thalamic peduncle ( itp ) , which modulates orbitofrontal cortex hyperactivity.17,18 bewernick and colleagues reported that dbs of the nucleus accumbens ( nac ) was associated with decreased ratings of depression and anxiety in trd patients.19 rush and colleagues20 noticed antidepressant effects when vns was used for epilepsy . 
 vns modulates neural pathways associated with mood regulation : the nucleus tractus solitaries , raphe nucleus , and locus ceruleus.21 in fact , the vns device stimulates left cervical vagus nerve containing afferent neurons tracking through the brain stem to cortical and subcortical networks.2023 furthermore , some neurobiological studies reported disruptions in right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( r / ldlpfc ) in mood disorders . 
 also , rtms of r / ldlpfc results in antidepressive effects coupled with increasing cerebral blood supply to this brain areas.2325 certainly , nts target more specific , localized regions in the brain , which are somehow dysfunctional in md . 
 it remains uncertain how the depression is relieved ; this is yet to be understood well , and hence basic neurobiological studies are needed . similarly with regard to ect 
 modified ect has been used extensively in psychotic depression , schizophrenia , mania , and other mental disorders . 
 it requires light anesthesia and is a recognized mode of treatment for trd.31,32 it remains the most effective therapy in trd patients with a response rate of 50%70% , though the strength of recommendation of ect is c.33,34 it targets nonspecific , broad regions of the cortex , and its mechanism of action is elusive . 
 notably , high post - ect relapse rate and safety profile are of great concern for trd patients and health providers as well . in a study of patients with nonpsychotic md that tested whether pre - ect medication resistance is associated with post - ect relapse rates , 
 it was observed that 34.6% of nonmedication - resistant patients who were not exposed to at least one antidepressant medication trial relapsed , while 50.0% of medication - resistant patients relapsed , a difference that was not statistically significant but clinically relevant.35 furthermore , in the first week after acute remission , 9.8% of patients not having at least one antidepressant medication trial met relapse criteria , while 31.4% of medication - resistant patients met relapse criteria , a difference that was statistically significant . it was concluded that md patients who have had at least one adequate antidepressant medication trial or no such trial before ect may be especially prone to early relapse after successful acute remission with mect.35 research is needed to develop strategies in order to prevent relapse following successful ect in md , which may be maintenance ect and a combination of pharmacotherapy and mect . 
 furthermore , it is also important to identify the predictors of nonresponse to mect . in a large sample of patients with trd , mect was effective in 66% of patients . 
 mect nonresponse was associated with bipolar subtype , mixed features , slightly less severe depressive symptoms , and longer duration of the depressive episode.36 in another study that aimed to investigate whether the clinical course of trd patients following a course of mect might be associated with changes of plasma brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) concentrations , it was shown that at baseline , plasma bdnf levels of patients were significantly lower than those of control subjects , and those after ect were significantly increased in parallel with the decrease of the hamilton depression rating scale ( hdrs ) total score . 
 only remitter patients who showed higher baseline bdnf levels than nonremitters reached normalized bdnf levels after mect . 
 these findings suggested the potential usefulness of baseline plasma bdnf levels as predictors of response to mect in trd patients.37 in an earlier study of 18 patients with trd , levels of bdnf and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol but not homovanillic acid were increased following mect in responders , which suggested that dopamine and bdnf might be involved in the mechanism of action of mect.38 in a recent study of adolescents with trd , both continuation and maintenance of mect were useful and safe for selected adolescents with severe trd , and symptom remission was achieved without experiencing cognitive impairment;39 the latter is a surprising finding and needs replication studies . 
 interestingly , in another development , data support the use of ketamine as anesthetic agent prior to ect for increasing its antidepressant effect as compared to propofol . in a related study , 31 inpatients with 
 the hdrs was used to evaluate these patients before ect and after the completion of the second , fourth , sixth , and eighth ect sessions . 
 the hdrs scores improved earlier in the ketamine group , with decreases in hdrs scores that were significantly greater in the ketamine group . 
 the implication of this finding is that the symptoms of md might be alleviated rapidly if ketamine anesthesia is used in trd patients during ect.40 a retrospective evaluation of 5482 ect treatments in 455 patients with trd found therapeutic advantages in combination therapies versus ect . 
 a total of 18.2% of treatments were ect monotherapy , 8.87% were done with one antidepressant . 
 results revealed that seizure duration was unaffected by most antidepressants , but ssri caused a lengthened seizure activity . 
 postictal suppression was lower in mirtazapine and higher in ssri and snri - treated patients . 
 a significant enhancement of therapeutic effectiveness was seen in the patient group receiving tricyclics , ssri , or mirtazapine , with no serious adverse events . 
 baghai and colleagues suggested that controlled studies are necessary to investigate further the possible advantages of ect and pharmacotherapy combinations , especially the use of modern dual - acting antidepressants , which also have proven their efficacy in trd.41 although mect is effective in trd , it significantly produces transient confusion , anterograde amnesia , and retrograde amnesia . 
 therefore , scientists have focused attention on technological refinements in ect and also developing techniques that do not cause cognitive impairment and at the same time remain effective in md and trd.4246 
 the fda has approved rtms for the treatment of md and trd in adolescents and adults . 
 its other indications include chronic pain , movement disorders , stroke , epilepsy , tinnitus , and other psychiatric disorders . 
 notably , rtms is safer on long - term use and acts more selectively than mect on brain areas implicated in the pathogenesis of md.47,48 the rtms has two forms : high - frequency rapid ( hfr ) ( > 1 hz ) and low - frequency slow ( lfs ) ( 1 hz ) . 
 furthermore , hfr rtms is preferred over lfs sychronized tms , as the former was associated with more antidepressant effects in depressed patients as reflected by significant increases in blood supply to prefrontal cortical and limbic regions.23 a sequential bilateral rtms ( lf right [ lfr ] then hf left [ hfl ] ) is also effective in trd patients but not more effective than unilateral hfl rtms.49,50 in an open - label study , 21 patients who failed two antidepressant trials were given rtms ( hf , 10 hz and intensity of 110% ) for 4 weeks , keeping the dose of preexisting antidepressants unchanged . 
 the majority of patients ( n = 19 ) completed the 4-week study and were assessed . in intention - to - 
 treat analysis , the mean hdrs scores were reduced from 30.80  5.00 to 19.00  6.37 . 
 no patient discontinued rtms due to adverse effects , including headache , which was reported by 16% of patients . 
 the study indicated the potential utility of rtms as an augmenting agent in trd.51 like lfr then hfl sequential bilateral rtms , hfl and lfr unilateral rtms are also efficacious in trd . in a 6-week double - blind , 
 randomized , sham - controlled trial in 50 patients with trd , three trains of lf rtms to the right prefrontal cortex of 140 seconds duration at 1 hz were applied daily , followed immediately by 15 trains of 5 seconds duration of hfl rtms at 10 hz . 
 according to this study , there was a significantly greater response to active than sham stimulation at 2 weeks and across the full duration of the study . 
 a significant proportion of the study group receiving active treatment met response ( 44% ) or remission ( 36% ) criteria by study end compared to the sham stimulation group ( 8% ) , and none remitted ( 0% ) . 
 it was noted that sequentially applying both hfl rtms and lfr rtms to the right prefrontal cortex resulted in substantial improvement in patients with trd . 
 furthermore , the treatment response accumulated to a clinically meaningful level over 46 weeks of active treatment.23 in another controlled investigation , patients with trd were randomized to receive 15 sessions of active or sham rtms delivered to the ldlpfc at 110% the estimated prefrontal cortex threshold . 
 the results showed response rate ( 50% decrease in hdrs score ) for the rtms group was 30.6% , significantly greater than the 6.1% rate in the sham group . 
 the remission rate ( an hdrs score < 8) for the rtms group was 20% , significantly greater than the 3% rate in the sham group . 
 the authors concluded that rtms to ldlpfc can produce statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects in patients with trd.25 in another study , subjects between the ages of 18 and 85 years were recruited from a tertiary care university hospital . 
 seventy - four subjects with trd and an hdrs score > 21 were randomized to receive unilateral , bilateral , or sham rtms . according to this study , 
 the remission rate was significantly higher in the bilateral group than the sham group , but the remission rate in the unilateral group did not differ from either group . 
 these findings warrant larger controlled studies that compare the efficacy of sequential bilateral rtms and hfl / lfr rtms in md and trd.50,52 from a safety perspective , rtms can rarely induce accidental seizures , especially among patients with brain insult and on medications that reduce seizure threshold . however , this major side effect could be curtailed if expert guidelines are followed.53,54 over the past 10 years , a number of meta - analyses of rtms efficacy studies were conducted and the summary of these studies is as follows : a minimum of five to a maximum of 33 studies included ; almost all included studies except one focused on depression rather than trd ; rtms was more effective than sham rtms ; quality of studies improved successively ; and rtms designs also improved and effect size of rtms was comparable to antidepressant drugs.5560 finally , moreines and colleagues61 have reviewed the neuropsychological effects of somatic therapies including rtms that were associated with reversible mild reductions in sustained attention , spatial planning , and verbal retention . 
 the fda approved the use of vns in patients with md and trd in 2005.62,63 vns principally stimulates the left cervical vagus nerve with a programmable neurostimulator . 
 observations of mood elevation during vns for resistant epilepsy have suggested its potential role in trd.21,22,64 vns targets the nucleus tractus solitarius , frontolimbic network , the locus ceruleus , and dorsal raphe nucleus , which regulate mood . 
 notably , initial studies on vns reported inconsistent findings regarding reduced metabolism and blood flow in targeted brain networks with no putative antidepressant mechanism.21,63,65 similarly , a multicenter study on vns found no significant reductions in depression scores for the experimental group as a whole , but antidepressant responses were observed among 40% of 30 recruited patients with trd.20 however , subsequent studies on vns reported positive results . in a naturalistic , 1-year , follow - up study of 30 trd patients who received vns , 
 the results were as follows : response rate of 40%46% was sustained and the remission rate significantly increased , from 17% to 29% with an additional 9 months of long - term vns . 
 it was concluded that long - term vns was associated with sustained benefit linked with good functional status.66 another naturalistic study with 2 years follow - up of 74 european patients with trd showed a significant reduction at all the three time points , ie , 3 , 12 , and 24 months of vns in the hdrs scores . 
 after 2 years , 53.1% of the patients responded well , and 38.9% fulfilled the remission criteria . 
 the proportion of patients with remission remained constant as the duration of vns increased , with no concomitant antidepressant medication significant impact . 
 this 2-year open - label trial of vns suggested a clinical response and a benign adverse - effect profile among patients with trd.67 in a recent study of 15 consecutive outpatients with trd , vns significantly decreased beck depression inventory ( bdi ) scores compared to baseline at 6 and 12 months , from a mean of 37.8  7.8 before vns activation to a mean of 24.6  11.4 at 12 months . by 1 year , 28.6% of patients responded to vns and 7.1% remitted . 
 hdrs showed similar improvement at 1 year , with a 43% response rate and 14.3% remission rate . reported side effects of vns in decreasing frequency were hoarseness , dyspnea , nausea , pain , and anxiety , and no patient terminated treatment due to side effects . according to this study , a substantial minority of patients with trd benefited from vns.68 vns 
 but it has no adverse neuropsychological effects.61 in a study of single patients , vns produced good results , with cost savings over mect.69 according to a systematic review , vns examined in four clinical trials with 355 patients demonstrated steadily increasing improvement with full benefit after 612 months , sustained up to 2 years . 
 but the primary results of the only controlled trial were negative and attributed to small sample size . 
 further controlled studies with large sample size are warranted to establish its efficacy and tolerability in future.62,70 the issue of predictors of response to vns is addressed sparsely . in an open - label study of trd , 
 the predictors of response to vns were history of resistant depression , mild to moderate resistant depression , not - severe resistant depression , and no history of use of ect.71 trials of vns in combination with pharmacotherapy are also needed in trd populations . 
 transcranial direct current stimulation , a noninvasive technique with no fda approval , has been used in patients with md with mixed results . 
 tdcs of the prefrontal cortex has been proposed as a therapeutic intervention in md.72,73 in a parallel - group , double - blind clinical trial , 40 patients with md who were medication - free were randomized into three groups . 
 they were assessed by a blind rater using hdrs and bdi after ten sessions of tdcs during a 2-week period . according to this investigation , significantly larger reductions in depression scores after dlpfc tdcs 
 moreover , the beneficial effects of tdcs in the dlpfc group persisted for 1 month after the end of treatment . 
 the authors suggested further investigation on the effects of tdcs for the treatment of md.72 another double - blind , randomized study tested tdcs in 40 depressed participants and used the following parameters : 1-ma current strength , five treatment sessions , active or sham , and given on alternate days . 
 anodal stimulation was centered over the left dlpfc , with the cathode placed on the lateral aspect of the contralateral orbit . 
 overall , depression scores improved significantly over ten tdcs treatments , but there was no between - group difference in the five - session , sham - controlled phase . according to this study,73 tdcs was found to be safe , with no adverse effects on a variety of assessed neuropsychological functions.61 it was recommended that the efficacy of tdcs in md be further evaluated over a longer treatment period , using enhanced stimulation parameters.73 in another study , 22 patients with trd were randomly assigned to a crossover protocol comparing tdcs and placebo stimulation add - on to a stable antidepressant medication . 
 the parameters of active tdcs were 1 or 2 ma for 20 minutes / day , anode over the left dlpfc , and cathode over the contralateral supraorbital region . 
 the results showed that there was no significant difference in depression scores after 2 weeks of real compared with 2 weeks of sham tdcs . 
 in contrast , subjective mood ratings showed an increase in positive emotions after real tdcs compared with sham tdcs . 
 anodal tdcs , applied for 2 weeks , was not superior to placebo stimulation in patients with trd . 
 the authors suggested that modified and improved tdcs protocols should be carried out in controlled trials to develop tdcs with better efficacy in trd.74 all aforementioned studies except one74 addressed the usefulness of tdcs in md , and hence more controlled trials are needed in trd patients . 
 deep brain stimulation , yet to be approved by the fda , is a reversible invasive technique that involves stereotactical implantation of electrodes powered by a pulse generator into the specific dysfunctional brain regions implicated in mood disorders , parkinson s disease , alzheimer s disease , movement disorders , and other neuropsychiatric disorders . 
 high frequency dbs of motor , mood , and cognitive neuronal circuits is reported to improve these conditions.75 dbs therapy , dose- and site - dependent , is a less invasive and less extreme alternative to ablative psychosurgeries.76 research data supports dbs that targets cortico - striatal - pallido - thalamocortical loop , the vc / vs , and other neuronal networks in patients with md , trd , ocd , and tourette s syndrome.7781 additionally , nac that contains dopamine , a reward system and involved in the pathogenesis of md , is a promising target for dbs . in a study , 
 twelve months later , five patients reached 50% reduction of the hdrs score , with significantly increased pleasure activities . 
 furthermore , the [ f]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose positron emission tomography data revealed that dbs decreased metabolism in the scg , orbital prefrontal cortex , and amygdala . this study supported antidepressant and antianhedonic effects of dbs in patients with trd . 
 however , the small sample size limits the interpretation of results , and further research recruiting larger samples is needed.82 in a multicenter study of 21 trd patients who received dbs , it was found that patients treated with scg dbs had variable response with time : 57% at 1 month , 48% at 6 months , and 29% at 12 months . 
 the response rate after 12 months of dbs increased to 62% when redefined as a reduction in the baseline hrsd of 40% or more . 
 additionally , reductions in depressive symptoms were associated with amelioration in disease severity in patients who responded to surgery . 
 overall , this study corroborated the results of other research that the outcome of scg dbs may be replicated across multiple centers.83 in two influential review articles , researchers have provided greater details of somatic treatments in terms of target structures , motivation , response rates , mechanism of action , and technical issues.8,9 accordingly , somatic therapies targeted scg , vc / vs , left cervical vagus nerve , r / l dlpfc , gpi , lateral habenula , and itp in md and trd patients , and improvement reported ranged from 30.6% to 66.7%.8,10,12,14 ( table 2 ) . 
 furthermore , an improvement of 100% was reported in two dbs studies that included one patient with dystonia and trd and another patient with md and tardive dyskinesia.16,17 on a long - term basis ( 6 years ) , dbs is safe and effective in patients with trd , as substantiated by recent data.8789 according to these studies,8789 chronic dbs scg was effective in trd and bipolar patients and well tolerated with minor hemorrhagic events,86,90,91 but no neurocognitive impairment was reported61 ( table 3 ) . as a mechanism of action , overactive scg glucose metabolism seen in md is reduced with antidepressant therapies and dbs.10,11 
 magnetic seizure therapy , also known as magnetic convulsion therapy and yet to be approved by the fda , has antidepressant effects . 
 studies conducted in humans and primates suggest that cognitive side effects of mst are more benign than those of mect . 
 notably , postictal orientation recovery time is short and rapid with mst.61,92,93 furthermore , several studies have corroborated improved cognitive outcomes with mst as compared to mect . however , neither therapy causes structural changes , ie , volume , total number , or numerical density in neurons or glia in the frontal cortex , hippocampus , and their subregions in human and nonhuman brain.9496 overall , magnetic seizures with benign side - effect profile are therapeutically better than mect seizures . 
 other than adverse neurocognitive effects , ect is also associated with reversible bradycardia and tachycardia immediate post - ect and ictal and postictal stages , respectively . in nonhuman studies of mst , 
 these effects were minimal , reflecting a more superficial cortical site of action with less impact on deep brain structures , which are implicated in sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system control , relative to ect.97 both antidepressant activity and cognitive side - effect profile of mst were further addressed in an open - label study , which tested whether it is associated with clinically significant antidepressant effects in trd as an add - on therapy to controlled pharmacotherapy.85 twenty patients with trd were randomly assigned to receive either mst or ect for more than 2 years . 
 the primary outcome measure was antidepressant response assessed by madrs , and secondary outcome measures included hdrs , hamilton anxiety scale , bdi , and 90-item symptom checklist . 
 antidepressant response as defined by 50% improvement in madrs ratings was statistically significant and of similar size in both treatment groups with no cognitive side effects . 
 characteristics in mst- and ect - induced seizures were comparable , especially regarding ictal activity and postictal suppression . 
 kayser and colleagues suggested that mst may be a potential alternative to ect if efficacy and safety are validated in larger clinical trials.85 mst is reported to result in minimal retrograde and anterograde amnesia.61 in summary , more studies are needed to further substantiate the efficacy of mst in mood disorder , including trd patients . 
 notably , there is converging evidence that nts have a lower risk of neurocognitive side effects compared to mect , which are benign.61 ( table 4 ) . by and large , 
 short- and long - term research is needed to establish the efficacy , safety , and cost - effectiveness of neurostimulation therapies.98 in addition , these therapies in general need proper selection of patients in line with tailored treatment guidelines.99 also , treatment teams should strictly follow ethical guidelines , especially those concerning autonomy , voluntary consent , beneficence , and nonmaleficence prior to using nts in individual patients.48,80,100 there are other nts , including ces and ecs , used uncommonly for a variety of disorders , such as anxiety , headaches , pain , stroke recovery , movement disorders , insomnia , and depression , but the data are largely limited in trd patients.101,102 in a systematic review , rosa and lisanby have described the technical details of all nts , including indications , safety , and effectiveness of ecs and ces.8 at the neurophysiological level , ces is quite different from tdcs.103 in one study , with ecs that used prefrontal cortical modulation , an average 55% improvement in depression scores was demonstrated.104 ces is associated with headache and nausea followed by skin irritation.105 unlike dbs , epidural cortical stimulation has fewer side effects.8 
 there are other neuromodulation therapies on the horizon , which include fus , lfms , and nir.106109 the data about these approaches are limited and need further research , especially concerning their role in mood disorders , including trd populations . with regard to os 
 , microbial light - sensitive proteins called opsins are introduced into neurons and function as ion channels that open or close according to light exposure . 
 channelrhodopsin-2 is one that allows na+ ions to enter the cell following exposure to ~470 nm blue light.110 according to rosa and lisanby,8 the advent of this technique has multiple implications : targeting specific fiber tracts that overlap in space ; selectively activating or inactivating specific projection neurons to the same target ; being a contactless form of stimulation relying on photoactivation ; and its potential use in treating mood disorders . like dbs 
 , os will also require surgical implantation of the light - emitting electrode ; however , os certainly has other advantages over dbs.8 in one nonhuman study , antidepressant effects of os of medial prefrontal cortex have already been reported in a chronic social defeat stress model in rodents.111 more studies on newer nts are needed in human subjects with md and trd . 
 this is a qualitative review of literature on somatic therapies used in the management of md and refractory depression . about 30% of patients with trd not responding to several intervention approaches , including optimization , augmentation and a combination of antidepressant drugs , are the principle candidates for nts.59 among these therapies , mect is most extensively and effectively used in severe depression and trd but associated with serious neurocognitive adverse effects because of nonspecific , broad excitation of cortical and deeper structures of the brain , and its mechanism of action is continuingly debatable.2633 other noninvasive somatic treatments such as rtms , tdcs , mst , and ces target more specific neuronal networks in the brain that are dysfunctional in md , trd , and other neuropsychiatric disorders , and reported to have fairly good safety and clinical profiles with more benign neuropsychological side effects.8,9,2325,4861,7274,85 invasive nts , ie , vns , dbs , and ecs with nonserious adverse effect profile , 
 are also reported to be effective in patients with md and trd.810,1222,61,104 new nts on the horizon are also promising in patients with md and trd . 
 although short- and long - term evidence - based comparative - effectiveness data on the role of nts in adult patients trd is emerging at a rapid pace,112 further research on their technical optimization , mechanisms of action , efficacy , side effect profile , and cost - effectiveness in larger populations of trd patients are warranted in future . 
 there is converging evidence that up to 40% patients with md fail to respond to an initial antidepressant therapy . 
 modified ect has a definite place in the management of patients with trd ; however , it carries well - known potential for neurocognitive impairment . like ect , mst also has neuropsychological adverse effects but of a milder nature . 
 the role of other neuromodulation methods , including vns , rtms , dbs , and tdcs , in trd patients is expanding with greater efficacy and fewer side effects . 
 these treatment modalities could be used alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy and/or psychotherapy . besides their therapeutic utility 
 , neuromodulation techniques can further open windows into the biological basis of disordered neurocircuits related to md and trd . 
 most studies on somatic therapies are of small sample size and hence reflect less reliable and valid results . therefore , collaborative 
 , multisite and/or multicountry studies that use the same protocols and also recruit larger samples with trd are urgently needed . 
 this methodological dilemma could be circumvented by determining a hypothesis a priori and others as exploratory . 
 most importantly , trd evades a universally accepted definition , and hence tools to measure refractoriness of depression and strict eligibility criteria need to be developed . 
 evidently , poor results of recent md and trd trials indicate the heterogeneous nature of depression and trd as well . therefore , treatment trials of somatic therapies should target more specific subpopulations together with the detection of endophenotypes to predict their response another challenge is blinding , which is vulnerable , and both the use of external raters and avoiding contact between subjects will solve this problem . additionally , open - label studies , especially of vns and dbs , tend to produce weak results , and therefore alternative designs including partial crossover and comparison against waiting list are needed . 
 there is a relative lack of follow - up studies on somatic therapies , and hence more naturalistic studies are required in future . 
 it is observed that the optimal parameters of somatic therapies are not defined , which could be managed by the use of adaptive designs and collaborative networks . 
 finally , unlike nonpharmacologic research in adults with trd,112 there is a relative lack of direct comparison with antidepressant drugs , and hence comparative research is needed . 
 most of these recommendations were constructed closely matching the challenges reported in the literature on nts , md , and trd populations.8,72,113","backgroundpatients with treatment - resistant depression ( trd ) who showed partial response to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions need a trial of neuromodulation therapies ( nts).objectivethis paper aims to review evidence - based data on the use of nts in trd.methodusing keywords and combined - word strategy , multiple computer searches of pubmed , google scholar , quertle(r ) , and medline were conducted for retrieving relevant articles published in english - language peer - reviewed journals ( 20002012 ) .

 some studies reported no benefits from transcranial direct current stimulation . 
 nts were reported to have good clinical efficacy , better safety margin , and benign side - effect profile .

 both modified electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy were associated with reversible but disturbing neurocognitive adverse effects . besides clinical utility , nts including approaches on the horizon may unlock the biological basis underlying mood disorders including trd.conclusionnts are promising in patients with trd , as the majority of them show good clinical response measured by standardized depression scales . 
 nts need further technological refinements and optimization together with continuing well - designed studies that recruit larger numbers of participants with trd .",pubmed
"small rna molecules are important in the regulation of various molecular and biological activities in the cell , and it is now well known that short rna sequences play a critical role in regulating the expression levels of specific genes in a targeted manner . 
 rna interference ( rnai ) has become widely recognized to be an important gene regulatory mechanism that causes sequence - specific downregulation of mrnas . 
 acting through this mechanism , double - stranded short interfering rnas ( sirnas ) can knock down expression levels via the rna - induced silencing complex , which mediates degradation or translational inhibition of the targeted mrnas . 
 moreover , in addition to rna - induced silencing complex - mediated regulation at the post - transcriptional level , rnai can also modulate gene transcription itself . 
 in fission yeast , homologs of the rna - induced silencing complex can regulate chromatin through recruitment of histone - modifying proteins to loci transcribing small noncoding rna , a mechanism also seen in plants , ciliates , nematodes , and flies . 
 small promoter - targeted rnas have also been shown to repress transcription and induce epigenetic changes in eukaryotic cells through a mechanism called transcriptional gene silencing . in human cells 
 , it has recently been reported that short rnas targeted to the promoter regions of certain genes can activate expression at the transcriptional level . 
 this phenomenon has been called rna activation ( rnaa ) , and has been shown to be conserved in other mammalian species , including mouse , rat , and nonhuman primates . 
 promoter - targeted small hairpin rnas have also been shown to efficiently upregulate genes in vivo . while the mechanism is not completely understood 
 , it appears that naturally occurring antisense transcripts arising from or near the same genetic locus are able to direct recruitment of argonaute proteins and histone methyltransferases . 
 short - activating rnas ( sarna ) may regulate transcription by targeting these antisense transcripts for degradation , resulting in a reversal of this epigenetic silencing and upregulation of sense mrna . 
 based on this approach , we have developed a method to design sarnas for upregulation of specific cellular genes . in the present study , we focused on the feasibility and genetic consequences of upregulating important target genes involved in stem cell regulation and reprogramming . 
 combined expression of the transcription factors kruppel - like factor 4 ( klf4 ) , pou5f1 ( also called oct3/4 ) , sox2 , and c - myc has been shown to reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem ( ips ) cells . 
 in particular , klf4 is important for maintenance of embryonic stem cells , and has been reported to be a master regulator in embryonic stem cells that controls the expression of other pluripotency factors including pou5f1 , sox2 , c - myc , and nanog . 
 it has previously been reported that direct reprogramming can be achieved in murine fibroblasts with only klf4 , oct4 , and sox2 . 
 however , it has recently been shown that c - myc is critical for efficient induction of pluripotency in the early phases of reprogramming , by altering the metabolic state of the cell . accordingly , in the present study , we employed a genomic  bioinformatic approach to design sarnas that specifically target two of these key reprogramming genes , klf4 and myc . 
 these sarnas were tested for their ability to upregulate the targeted reprogramming factors , as well as their respective downstream genes , in human mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) , adult bone marrow - derived tissue - specific stem cells that already have multilineage differentiation potential . 
 the effects of sarna transfection on endogenous gene expression profiles were compared with those resulting from lentiviral vector - mediated overexpression of the exogenous klf4 and c - myc transgenes . to date , there have been no studies comprehensively examining the cellular gene expression profiles after sarna - mediated gene activation of endogenous genes , particularly pluripotency - related genes , and few studies comparing how different reprogramming methods might differentially affect various cellular pathways . 
 these results indicate that the use of sarna shows significant potential , both as a tool for studying stem cell biology , as well as a safe method to manipulate stem cell gene expression without altering the genome . 
 to design sarna candidates for activation of stem cell factors , we developed a novel bioinformatic approach . 
 the klf4 gene , located on chromosome 9 ( 9q31.2 ) , and c - myc gene , located on chromosome 8 ( 8q24.21 ) , were our initial targets for activation ( figure 1a , b ) . to identify potential antisense transcripts from the klf4 and c - myc loci , we searched the genomic region surrounding each locus for spliced expressed sequence tags ( ests ) which mapped to the positive strand . although it is usually difficult to determine the transcriptional orientation of ests , orientation can be determined by using splice site signatures of spliced ests . 
 we found no spliced ests that overlapped klf4 , but the scan identified one antisense est ( db461753 ) ~15  kb upstream of klf4 's annotated transcription start site ( tss ) . 
 we were also unable to find a spliced ests that overlapped c - myc , but identified one antisense est ( bc042052 ) ~2  kb upstream of c - myc 's tss . 
 recent deep sequencing experiments have revealed that antisense rnas often are found in the region surrounding tsss . 
 therefore , this region was chosen to design sarna sequences that targeted potential antisense transcripts from the promoter region . 
 we used the antisense sequence 500 nts upstream and downstream from the tss ( abbreviated klf4_as_tss+/500 and myc_as_tss+/500 ) as a second target candidate . 
 our goal was to design short sense rnas that could potentially bind and degrade antisense rnas generated from the two candidate sequences ( ests and the regions surrounding tsss ) with the hypothesis that this binding and degradation of the antisense rnas would activate gene expression . 
 candidate sarnas targeting the 500 nt upstream of the tss were designated pr1 , whereas those targeting the 500 nt downstream of the tss were designated pr2 . to give effective antisense targeting and degradation and to minimize off - target effects 
 , we used the gpboost sirna design algorithm to identify potential short rnas for downregulating the two candidate sequences . from the lists of predicted sirna candidates 
 , we selected the two most promising non - overlapping sirna target sites on the antisense est db461753 and bc042052 , and the most promising sirna target site on each side of the klf4 and c - myc tss within the antisense promoter sequence ( klf4_as_tss+/500 and myc_as_tss+/500 ) . 
 reasoning that activation of pluripotency factor gene expression might be more readily achieved in adult tissue - derived stem cells that retain restricted multilineage potential , we then tested whether these sarna candidates could upregulate klf4 or c - myc expression , respectively , in primary human mscs derived from adult bone marrow . 
 target gene expression levels were examined by quantitative pcr of reverse - transcribed mrna from msc cultures after transfection of each individual sarna candidate oligonucleotide , as compared with transfection with an alexa fluor 555- or fam - labeled negative control oligo . 
 a transfection efficiency of > 95% was determined by flow cytometry and by knockdown with control sirnas using the same transfection conditions ( see supplementary materials and methods and supplementary figures s1 and s2 ) . 
 initially , none of the sarna oligos appeared to show any effect on target gene expression after 48 hours . 
 however , upon continued transfection with klf4-pr1 sarna every other day , significant upregulation of klf4 mrna ( figure 2a ) was observed , on the order of 2.5-fold over controls by day 4 , and reaching approximately fourfold by day 6 of treatment ( p < 0.01 ) . 
 target gene mrna levels after treatment with klf4-pr1 were significantly higher when mscs were exposed to sarna at concentrations of 25 or 50  nmol / l , as compared with 5  nmol / l ( figure 2b ) . 
 increased klf4 protein was confirmed in mscs treated with klf4-pr1 sarna ( figure 2c , left panel ) by western blot analysis , and densitometric quantitation of these blots showed over threefold upregulation of klf4 protein relative to -actin internal control ( figure 2c , right panel ) , correlating closely with the level of mrna upregulation . 
 this time - dependent upregulation of klf4 gene expression by the klf4 promoter - targeted pr1 sarna was observed consistently over multiple experiments . 
 none of the other three klf4-targeted sarna candidate sequences was able to upregulate target gene expression , although conversely , klf4-db1 appeared to reduce klf4 mrna levels in mscs to about 60% that of scrambled oligo - treated controls by day 6 . 
 similarly , we found that among the four sarna candidate sequences targeted to the c - myc promoter and antisense ests , both myc - pr1 and myc - pr2 were able to induce consistent upregulation of myc mrna ( figure 2d ) by up to 1.8-fold ( p < 0.01 ) and 1.6-fold ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively , during the 6-day interval of treatment , as compared with scrambled sequence controls . 
 while myc - bc1 and myc - bc2 also appeared to affect myc mrna levels to some extent , these effects were more modest , and were not consistent between days 4 and 6 . 
 again , target gene mrna levels after treatment with myc - pr1 and myc - pr2 were significantly higher when mscs were exposed to sarna at concentrations of 25 or 50 
 nmol / l , as compared with 5  nmol / l ( figure 2e ) . 
 image densitometry analysis of western blots from mscs treated with myc - pr1 or myc - pr2 again confirmed upregulation of c - myc protein by over 2.5-fold relative to -actin internal control ( figure 2f ) . 
 all western blots were performed in triplicate with replicates shown in supplementary figure s3 . to determine whether this upregulation of klf4 and myc is due to true transcriptional activation , expression levels of nascent rna were assessed . 
 mscs were pulsed with ethynyl uridine ( eu ) during sarna treatment and total rna was isolated . 
 newly transcribed eu - rna was separated from total rna by biotinylation of eu in a copper - catalyzed  click  reaction , followed by purification on streptavidin magnetic beads . 
 quantitative pcr of reverse - transcribed nascent rna showed that the level of nascent klf4 mrna was significantly upregulated with klf4-pr1 treatment across a 6-day timecourse ( figure 3a ) . 
 the level of nascent myc mrna was significantly upregulated with myc - pr2 treatment , whereas no significant change in nascent myc mrna expression was seen with myc - pr1 treatment ( figure 3b ) . to verify that these sarnas do not act through interferon response pathways , 
 no significant upregulation of interferon response genes was detected 24 hours after sarna treatment ( figure 3c ) . 
 in contrast , overexpression of klf4 and c - myc by lentiviral transduction showed dose - dependent induction of interferon response genes ( supplementary figure s4 ) . to further elucidate the mechanism of activation by sarna , 
 the presence of promoter - associated antisense rnas was investigated using 5 rapid amplification of cdna ends ( race ) . 
 since any antisense rnas involved in regulating gene expression may not be polyadenylated , random hexamers were used to prime cdna synthesis from total msc rna . 
 antisense strand - specific primers matching the klf4-pr1 , myc - pr1 , and myc - pr2 sarna sequences were used for 5 race to amplify potential antisense rnas that are targeted by each sarna and may be involved in regulation of expression . 
 race reactions were run on an agarose gel , followed by purification , cloning , and sequencing of any products ( see supplementary materials and methods ) . despite the presence of bands from each sarna primer , 
 each was identified to be a known mrna with homology to the 3 end of the sarna sequence , likely a result of mispriming at permissive annealing temperatures ( supplementary figure s5 ) . 
 repeats of this assay with more restrictive annealing temperatures yielded no products ( data not shown ) . to further rule out involvement of possible antisense rnas arising downstream of each sarna target sequence , cdna was synthesized from total msc rna using antisense strand - specific primers for klf4-pr1 , myc - pr1 , and myc - pr2 . 
 this cdna was used as template for pcrs using primers downstream of the sarna target sequence , which would be in the direction of the 5 end of any putative antisense transcript . 
 no antisense transcripts were amplified up to 525  bp from the klf4-pr1 target site ( supplementary figure s6a ) . of the priming sites up to 667 
 bp from myc - pr1 , including and surpassing the myc - pr2 target site , two products were amplified , cloned , and sequenced corresponding to the 63 and 136  bp downstream of myc - pr1 ( supplementary figure s6b ) . 
 the expression level of this antisense transcript was significantly upregulated with myc - pr2 treatment , whereas its upregulation with myc - pr1 was not statistically significant ( p = 0.0682 ) ( supplementary figure s6c ) . to assess the biological significance of sarna activation of klf4 and myc in mscs 
 , cells were monitored for morphological changes during oligo treatment with klf4-pr1 and myc - pr2 , which had been confirmed to be associated with increased nascent mrna transcribed from their respective target genes . 
 after 6 days of treatment , klf4-pr1treated mscs showed marked differences in cell morphology compared with control , whereas myc - pr2 had modest changes ( figure 4 ) . 
 in contrast to scrambled sequence oligo - treated controls , which appeared as progressively more densely packed fibroblastic cells over time , klf4-pr1treated mscs were less confluent and predominantly arranged in clusters with epitheloid cell - like morphology . 
 myc - pr2treated cells were less confluent than controls but appeared more heterogeneous with numerous epitheloid cells containing enlarged nuclei . 
 thus , target gene mrna levels after treatment with klf - pr1 and myc - pr2 , were significantly higher when mscs were exposed to these sarna oligos at concentrations of 25 or 50  nmol / l over a 6-day treatment period . hence , these promoter - targeted sarna oligos consistently induced increases in both mrna and protein expression of klf4 and c - myc , respectively , in a time- and dose - dependent manner . 
 neither of these sarnas activated the interferon response , and both appear to act through specific activation of transcription . 
 we therefore focused on these two positive sarnas , using the 6-day treatment protocol , in further experiments examining how sarna - mediated upregulation might affect downstream targets . 
 microarray analysis was performed to determine the global gene expression profile and to investigate possible off - target effects with sarna treatment . 
 differential gene expression profiles after upregulation of endogenous klf4 and c - myc by treatment with their respective sarnas versus control oligo were examined , and compared with that after overexpression of exogenous klf4 and c - myc delivered by viral gene transfer using commercially available second - generation lentivirus vectors . 
 mscs were transduced with 0.1 pg p24 protein per cell as determined by p24 elisa , a viral dose that does not result in significant induction of interferon response genes ( supplementary figure s4 ) . 
 only those cellular genes showing upward or downward changes in their expression levels at a significance level of at least p < 0.1 , as compared with their levels in scrambled sequence oligo - treated controls , were included in these analyses . 
 interestingly , analysis of the overall gene expression profile in human mscs after treatment with klf4 pr-1 ( figure 5a ) and myc - pr2 ( figure 5b ) showed that the majority of cellular genes exhibited concordant changes in expression , but with some notable differences , between upregulation by sarna and overexpression by lentiviral transduction . for mscs treated with klf4-pr1 sarna , 
 68% of the cellular genes showing significant changes in their expression levels ( 971 out of 1,429 genes ) showed the same pattern of regulation as klf4 lentivirus - transduced mscs . for mscs treated with myc - pr2 , 64% ( 273 out of 429 genes ) exhibited the same pattern of regulation . 
 however , this indicates that roughly a one - third of the cellular genes with significant changes in expression after sarna transfection or lentiviral gene transfer showed discordant regulation between these two groups . to determine whether these differences were due to off - target effects or resulted from the different methods used to activate expression , we used metacore pathway analysis from genego ( carlsbad , ca ) to determine what pathways were significantly enriched in those genes that were differentially regulated between sarna and virus samples . 
 notably , the pathways that were most significantly differentially regulated between klf4-pr1 sarna - treated mscs and klf4 virus - treated mscs were those involved in cytoskeletal remodeling , macropinocytosis , and regulation of epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , including transforming growth factor ( tgf)- induction of emt ( table 1 ) . the pathways that were most significantly differentially regulated between myc - pr2 sarna - treated mscs and the c - myc virus - treated mscs included cell survival and proliferation pathways such as granzyme a signaling , tgf- regulation , and telomere length , as well as macropinocytosis and emt pathways ( table 2 ) . 
 that is , for klf4-targeted sarna versus klf4-virus , as well as myc - targeted sarna versus myc - virus , in both cases genes involved in the same pathways were found to be discordantly regulated in the same manner . 
 the high degree of similarity in differentially regulated pathways observed with two different sets of sarnas versus two different lentivirus vectors suggests that the discordant gene expression patterns primarily arise due to characteristic cellular changes in response to oligo transfection versus viral transduction , rather than off - target effects that are shared by each set of sarnas . to determine whether narrowing the focus of the differential expression analysis to those types of genes we expect to be regulated by klf4 and c - myc would yield greater similarity , we generated lists of genes involved in stem cell maintenance , development , and proliferation , as well as cell cycle - related genes from the amigo gene ontology database . 
 lists of genes used in this analysis are included in supplementary tables s2 and s3 . 
 heatmaps visualizing the differential expression profiles of klf4 sarna - treated and klf4 virus - treated msc compared with scrambled oligo - treated control msc for stem cell - related genes ( figure 5c ) and cell cycle - related genes ( figure 5d ) showed much greater similarity , with 74% ( 26 out of 35 ) exhibiting concordant regulation for stem cell - related genes , and 80% ( 132 out of 165 ) exhibiting concordant regulation for cell cycle - related genes . 
 heatmaps focused on cell cycle - related genes in myc - pr2 ( figure 5e ) sarna - treated msc compared to myc virus - treated msc also showed a higher degree of similarity , with 67% of cell cycle - related genes ( 8 out of 12 ) for myc - pr2 exhibiting concordant regulation . 
 further david gene ontology ( go ) analysis of all genes revealed that the most significantly enriched go terms in the klf4-pr1 sarna - treated samples were the same as those in the klf4 virus - treated samples ( table 3 ) . 
 similarly , the majority of the most significantly enriched go terms in the myc - pr2 sarna - treated samples were also significantly enriched in the c - myc virus - treated samples ( table 4 ) . 
 to further validate the gene expression profile , we chose several well - known transcriptional gene targets of klf4 and c - myc to verify the results seen in the microarray data by real - time pcr . 
 we found that klf4-pr1 sarna transfection resulted in significantly increased expression of the klf4 target genes cyclin d1 , ornithine decarboxylase ( odc1 ) , p21 , and p53 ( figure 6a ) ; klf4 virus - transduced cells also showed significantly increased expression of cyclin d1 and p21 to a similar degree , although not of odc1 or p53 . similarly , myc - pr2 sarna transfection resulted in significantly increased expression of c - myc target genes odc1 , p21 , and p53 , as did transduction with c - myc virus ( figure 6b ) . 
 finally , to assess the ability of the klf4-pr1 sarna to activate the expression of other reprogramming factors , we analyzed mrna expression of oct4 , sox2 , and myc , as well as the stem cell marker nanog , by real - time pcr . 
 we found that klf4 activation by sarna was also able to activate expression of oct4 , sox2 , myc , and nanog ( figure 6c ) . 
 further analysis of oct4 mrna isoforms showed that oct4a was being significantly upregulated , whereas oct4b showed no difference ( figure 6d ) . 
 conversely , the ability of myc - pr2 sarna to activate endogenous klf4 gene expression was also analyzed . in response to myc - pr2 transfection 
 , there was an approximately twofold increase in klf4 mrna levels ( figure 6e ) . 
 notably , this effect of myc - pr2 sarna was corroborated by the microarray analysis ( supplementary table s1 ) . 
 to design sarna candidates for activation of stem cell factors , we developed a novel bioinformatic approach . 
 the klf4 gene , located on chromosome 9 ( 9q31.2 ) , and c - myc gene , located on chromosome 8 ( 8q24.21 ) , were our initial targets for activation ( figure 1a , b ) . to identify potential antisense transcripts from the klf4 and c - myc loci , we searched the genomic region surrounding each locus for spliced expressed sequence tags ( ests ) which mapped to the positive strand . although it is usually difficult to determine the transcriptional orientation of ests , orientation can be determined by using splice site signatures of spliced ests .

 the expression level of this antisense transcript was significantly upregulated with myc - pr2 treatment , whereas its upregulation with myc - pr1 was not statistically significant ( p = 0.0682 ) ( supplementary figure s6c ) . to assess the biological significance of sarna activation of klf4 and myc in mscs 
 , cells were monitored for morphological changes during oligo treatment with klf4-pr1 and myc - pr2 , which had been confirmed to be associated with increased nascent mrna transcribed from their respective target genes . 
 after 6 days of treatment , klf4-pr1treated mscs showed marked differences in cell morphology compared with control , whereas myc - pr2 had modest changes ( figure 4 ) . 
 in contrast to scrambled sequence oligo - treated controls , which appeared as progressively more densely packed fibroblastic cells over time , klf4-pr1treated mscs were less confluent and predominantly arranged in clusters with epitheloid cell - like morphology . 
 myc - pr2treated cells were less confluent than controls but appeared more heterogeneous with numerous epitheloid cells containing enlarged nuclei . thus , target gene mrna levels after treatment with klf - pr1 and myc - pr2 , were significantly higher when mscs were exposed to these sarna oligos at concentrations of 25 or 50  nmol / l over a 6-day treatment period . 
 hence , these promoter - targeted sarna oligos consistently induced increases in both mrna and protein expression of klf4 and c - myc , respectively , in a time- and dose - dependent manner . 
 neither of these sarnas activated the interferon response , and both appear to act through specific activation of transcription . 
 we therefore focused on these two positive sarnas , using the 6-day treatment protocol , in further experiments examining how sarna - mediated upregulation might affect downstream targets . 
 microarray analysis was performed to determine the global gene expression profile and to investigate possible off - target effects with sarna treatment . 
 differential gene expression profiles after upregulation of endogenous klf4 and c - myc by treatment with their respective sarnas versus control oligo were examined , and compared with that after overexpression of exogenous klf4 and c - myc delivered by viral gene transfer using commercially available second - generation lentivirus vectors . 
 mscs were transduced with 0.1 pg p24 protein per cell as determined by p24 elisa , a viral dose that does not result in significant induction of interferon response genes ( supplementary figure s4 ) . 
 only those cellular genes showing upward or downward changes in their expression levels at a significance level of at least p < 0.1 , as compared with their levels in scrambled sequence oligo - treated controls , were included in these analyses . 
 interestingly , analysis of the overall gene expression profile in human mscs after treatment with klf4 pr-1 ( figure 5a ) and myc - pr2 ( figure 5b ) showed that the majority of cellular genes exhibited concordant changes in expression , but with some notable differences , between upregulation by sarna and overexpression by lentiviral transduction . for mscs treated with klf4-pr1 sarna , 68% of the cellular genes showing significant changes in their expression levels ( 971 out of 1,429 genes ) showed the same pattern of regulation as klf4 lentivirus - transduced mscs . for mscs treated with myc - pr2 
 , 64% ( 273 out of 429 genes ) exhibited the same pattern of regulation . 
 however , this indicates that roughly a one - third of the cellular genes with significant changes in expression after sarna transfection or lentiviral gene transfer showed discordant regulation between these two groups . to determine whether these differences were due to off - target effects or resulted from the different methods used to activate expression , we used metacore pathway analysis from genego ( carlsbad , ca ) to determine what pathways were significantly enriched in those genes that were differentially regulated between sarna and virus samples . 
 notably , the pathways that were most significantly differentially regulated between klf4-pr1 sarna - treated mscs and klf4 virus - treated mscs were those involved in cytoskeletal remodeling , macropinocytosis , and regulation of epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , including transforming growth factor ( tgf)- induction of emt ( table 1 ) . 
 the pathways that were most significantly differentially regulated between myc - pr2 sarna - treated mscs and the c - myc virus - treated mscs included cell survival and proliferation pathways such as granzyme a signaling , tgf- regulation , and telomere length , as well as macropinocytosis and emt pathways ( table 2 ) . 
 that is , for klf4-targeted sarna versus klf4-virus , as well as myc - targeted sarna versus myc - virus , in both cases genes involved in the same pathways were found to be discordantly regulated in the same manner . 
 the high degree of similarity in differentially regulated pathways observed with two different sets of sarnas versus two different lentivirus vectors suggests that the discordant gene expression patterns primarily arise due to characteristic cellular changes in response to oligo transfection versus viral transduction , rather than off - target effects that are shared by each set of sarnas . to determine whether narrowing the focus of the differential expression analysis to those types of genes we expect to be regulated by klf4 and c - myc would yield greater similarity , we generated lists of genes involved in stem cell maintenance , development , and proliferation , as well as cell cycle - related genes from the amigo gene ontology database . 
 lists of genes used in this analysis are included in supplementary tables s2 and s3 . 
 heatmaps visualizing the differential expression profiles of klf4 sarna - treated and klf4 virus - treated msc compared with scrambled oligo - treated control msc for stem cell - related genes ( figure 5c ) and cell cycle - related genes ( figure 5d ) showed much greater similarity , with 74% ( 26 out of 35 ) exhibiting concordant regulation for stem cell - related genes , and 80% ( 132 out of 165 ) exhibiting concordant regulation for cell cycle - related genes . 
 heatmaps focused on cell cycle - related genes in myc - pr2 ( figure 5e ) sarna - treated msc compared to myc virus - treated msc also showed a higher degree of similarity , with 67% of cell cycle - related genes ( 8 out of 12 ) for myc - pr2 exhibiting concordant regulation . 
 further david gene ontology ( go ) analysis of all genes revealed that the most significantly enriched go terms in the klf4-pr1 sarna - treated samples were the same as those in the klf4 virus - treated samples ( table 3 ) . 
 similarly , the majority of the most significantly enriched go terms in the myc - pr2 sarna - treated samples were also significantly enriched in the c - myc virus - treated samples ( table 4 ) . 
 to further validate the gene expression profile , we chose several well - known transcriptional gene targets of klf4 and c - myc to verify the results seen in the microarray data by real - time pcr . 
 we found that klf4-pr1 sarna transfection resulted in significantly increased expression of the klf4 target genes cyclin d1 , ornithine decarboxylase ( odc1 ) , p21 , and p53 ( figure 6a ) ; klf4 virus - transduced cells also showed significantly increased expression of cyclin d1 and p21 to a similar degree , although not of odc1 or p53 . 
 similarly , myc - pr2 sarna transfection resulted in significantly increased expression of c - myc target genes odc1 , p21 , and p53 , as did transduction with c - myc virus ( figure 6b ) . 
 finally , to assess the ability of the klf4-pr1 sarna to activate the expression of other reprogramming factors , we analyzed mrna expression of oct4 , sox2 , and myc , as well as the stem cell marker nanog , by real - time pcr . 
 we found that klf4 activation by sarna was also able to activate expression of oct4 , sox2 , myc , and nanog ( figure 6c ) . 
 further analysis of oct4 mrna isoforms showed that oct4a was being significantly upregulated , whereas oct4b showed no difference ( figure 6d ) . 
 conversely , the ability of myc - pr2 sarna to activate endogenous klf4 gene expression was also analyzed . in response to myc - pr2 transfection 
 , there was an approximately twofold increase in klf4 mrna levels ( figure 6e ) . 
 notably , this effect of myc - pr2 sarna was corroborated by the microarray analysis ( supplementary table s1 ) . 
 we have been able to identify and characterize two sarnas , klf4-pr1 and myc - pr2 , that specifically activate transcription of endogenous klf4 and myc genes , respectively , in primary human mscs . 
 interestingly , in both cases , it was a promoter - targeted sarna that gave the desired effect . given that studies implicate antisense rnas that overlap the gene of interest as the targets for degradation in rnaa , it is conceivable that these promoter - targeted sarnas are targeting an antisense rna that has not yet been discovered . 
 however , we were unable to identify any antisense transcripts arising from the region of the klf4-pr1 target site . 
 antisense transcripts have been reported to arise from the vicinity of the c - myc promoter in human cells such as prostate cancer cell lines , and we were able to identify one such antisense rna in primary human mscs . however , this antisense rna does not overlap the myc - pr2 target site and is therefore unlikely to be the rna target of myc - pr2 . 
 interestingly , this antisense rna does overlap the myc - pr1 target site , but cells transfected with myc - pr1 sarna did not show increased transcription of nascent myc mrna . 
 hence it is difficult to ascertain whether myc - pr1 does target this antisense rna , perhaps resulting in increased accumulation of myc sense mrna at a post - transcriptional level , or if the observed upregulation of myc mrna levels by myc - pr1 is an off - target effect . due to the relatively small activation of myc 
 , it would be difficult to completely rule out off - target effects even with the use of more sophisticated techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis . 
 furthermore , specific sarna - targeted effects on myc expression by transcriptional or post - transcriptional mechanisms , and coexisting off - target effects , are not necessarily mutually exclusive . 
 although it may not be possible for every gene to be activated by rnaa , our results suggest that this method could be used to generate sarna candidates for activation of other endogenous genes for which a promoter - associated antisense rna has not yet been defined . focusing on stem cell- and cell cycle - related genes , which were expected to be altered by klf4 and c - myc expression 
 , we found the similarities between sarna - transfected and virus - transduced samples to be quite striking . 
 this was confirmed by go analysis , as the most significantly enriched terms were nearly identical in klf4-pr1 oligo and klf4 virus samples , and most of the top myc - pr2 terms were also significantly enriched in the c - myc virus samples . 
 in addition , several well - known klf4 and c - myc target genes were validated by real - time pcr , and showed a similar pattern of expression in the sarna - treated samples as in the virus - transduced samples . 
 furthermore , we have shown that klf4 sarna is able to activate expression of endogenous pluripotency factors including oct4 , sox2 , nanog , and myc . 
 activation of oct4 was specific to oct4a , which has been reported to be essential for stemness in human embryonic stem cells . 
 the highly specific nature of oct4a upregulation in response to transfection of sarna targeting klf4 makes this likely to be a true downstream event caused by specific activation of klf4 . 
 furthermore , the sarna - treated mscs showed marked differences in cell morphology , supporting our conclusion that this activation is biologically relevant . 
 interestingly , for some downstream gene targets , our results were different from what was expected , as klf4 is expected to downregulate expression of cyclin d1 , ornithine decarboxylase , and p53 , whereas c - myc is expected to downregulate p21 . 
 however , these previously observed results are often cell- and tissue type - dependent , as evidenced by more recent reports showing activation of cyclin d1 and p53 by klf4 , and activation of p21 through p53 by c - myc in different cell types . 
 in addition , our data are consistent across both sarna- and virus - treated samples in independent microarray and real - time pcr experiments . as with rnai , 
 a primary concern for using rnaa to study biological processes is the minimization of potential off - target effects . to evaluate possible off - target effects , we compared the gene expression profile of sarna activation of klf4 and myc to lentiviral - mediated expression . 
 some significant differences were observed in the total gene expression profile , but this is perhaps not surprising , as one method employed transfection of sarna and the other lentiviral transduction . 
 indeed , the use of any transduction method involving introduction of long stretches of exogenous nucleic acids , including both viral vectors as well as plasmids , will likely activate a variety of innate signaling mechanisms . 
 this may result in unwanted upregulation of interferons and related genes that may not only cause protein synthesis shutdown and effects on cell proliferation , but may also impair normal stem cell function , as has been described in hematopoietic stem cells . 
 notably , our interferon response gene expression analysis as well as our microarray analysis of gene functional annotation and differentially regulated pathways showed no evidence of interferon response upregulation after sarna oligo transfection . 
 in contrast , we observed significant induction of interferon responses upon viral transduction at a dose of 1 pg p24 per cell . 
 this corresponds roughly to an multiplicity of infection of 10 , which is within the range of multiplicity of infections typically used in reprogramming protocols . 
 hence , it may be highly advantageous that rna duplexes < 23  bp in length will not cause induction of interferon , while effecting transcriptional gene activation of endogenous pluripotency factors . 
 in fact , when we focused on the genes that were differentially expressed between the sarna and virus samples , the most significantly enriched pathways implicated the use of lentiviral vector - mediated gene transfer as the cause of many of the expression profile changes that were discrepant . notably , cytoskeletal remodeling , including tgf - mediated remodeling , were upregulated in both klf4 virus- and c - myc virus - treated samples . 
 it is well known that retroviruses manipulate the host cytoskeleton to facilitate virus entry and integration . 
 furthermore , the presence of tgf signaling pathways is also not surprising , considering that carryover of hiv tat can occur after packaging of second - generation lentivirus vectors , and that tat protein has been associated with the induction of tgf- , which likely serves multiple functions for the virus , including immunosuppression and facilitation of cytoskeletal remodeling . 
 the differential regulation of macropinocytosis in both klf4 virus- and c - myc virus - treated samples is also likely due to viral entry , as both native hiv- and vesicular stomatitis virus - g ( vsv - g)pseudotyped hiv vectors have been reported to use macropinocytosis for entry . 
 notably , several emt regulation pathways were observed to be differentially regulated between sarna- and virus - treated samples , irrespective of whether it was klf4 or c - myc being targeted or transduced . 
 this was quite striking , as it has been reported that suppression of emt signals is required for reprogramming mouse fibroblasts . 
 klf4 serves to activate the mesenchymal - to - epithelial transition ( met ) that is required for reprogramming , whereas oct4 , sox2 , and c - myc suppress tgf-induced emt . 
 the differential regulation of these pathways in our experiments fits well into this model , as in both cases klf4 and c - myc are acting in competition with the tgf- induced by lentiviral infection . 
 this suggests that using lentiviral vectors to activate reprogramming factors may actually hinder the reprogramming process , as these vectors have been shown to activate tgf- signaling . 
 this underscores the need for alternative methods of gene activation in reprogramming . in recent years 
 , invaluable information has been obtained from the use of rnai to study stem cell biology by inhibiting expression of specific genes involved in the regulation of pluripotency within embryonic as well as somatic stem cells . here , we have shown the potential of using sarnas that , conversely , upregulate expression of endogenous genes in stem cells . as each gene can be selectively targeted for activation , the use of sarnas may also provide a highly useful tool in studying the contribution of individual factors in ips cell reprogramming . 
 several studies have used inducible systems to study the reprogramming process , but these have been limited by the inability to activate or repress the activity of each factor individually . since rnaa is a transient process , it may be possible to develop an optimized protocol for ips cell production wherein each factor can be activated when needed by the transfection of its specific sarna , and similarly removed when it is no longer necessary . in this context , 
 current methods for upregulating klf4 and c - myc require transfection or viral transduction of klf4 or c - myc expression vectors into cells . 
 as noted above , this study suggests that the tgf- induced by lentiviral vectors may actually be detrimental to reprogramming . 
 further , oncogenic reactivation of stably integrated c - myc transgenes poses a serious safety issue to the use of ips cells . 
 in addition , evidence that latent viral expression of reprogramming factors impairs normal differentiation of ips cells , and intolerance to genomic damage caused by exogenous dna or transposon integration further emphasizes the need for a method of ips cell generation that uses endogenous cellular processes and requires no foreign dna . in this regard , while reprogramming to full pluripotency has not , to date , been demonstrated with this method , other groups have recently shown sarna - mediated upregulation of endogenous oct4 in a breast cancer cell line , and endogenous klf4 in prostate cancer cell lines . notably , 
 downstream gene expression and phenotypic changes induced by sarna - mediated upregulation of klf4 in prostate cancer cell lines were reported to be comparable to those obtained by retroviral vector transduction . 
 this is consistent with our results obtained in primary human mscs , and suggests that the use of synthetic sarna oligos may prove highly advantageous as a safe and efficient alternative for upregulation of endogenous reprogramming genes . 
 four parameters were used : ( i ) download target gene annotations ; ( ii ) identify antisense rna target sequences ; ( iii ) select promoter antisense sequences ; and ( iv ) identify candidate sarnas . 
 first , the method downloads information about the target 's genomic location , orientation , and transcriptional structure from available databases such as the refseq database at ucsc ( university of california , santa cruz ) . 
 second , given a database of rna transcripts with known read direction , such as the ucsc spliced est track , our method searches the database for transcripts that are antisense to and in the vicinity of the target gene . 
 more specifically , the method identifies antisense transcripts that ( i ) overlap the target 's promoter and the target mrna 's 5 end ; ( ii ) overlap the target mrna ; ( iii ) are at most 20100  kb upstream of the target 's tss ; or ( iv ) are at most 20100  kb downstream of the target 's polyadenylation site . 
 the method uses these four criteria as hierarchical filters such that if it finds antisense transcripts that for example satisfy criterion ( i ) , the method does not consider the three other criteria . 
 third , based on the target 's tss , the method downloads the antisense genomic sequence from a fixed size region upstream and downstream of the tss . 
 the typical region size used by the method is 500 nts upstream and downstream of tss , but larger or smaller sizes can also be used . 
 fourth , the method designs sirnas that give effective and specific downregulation of the antisense target sequence . 
 the method ( i ) uses a sirna design algorithm , such as gpboost , to identify candidate effective sirnas ; ( ii ) removes all candidate sirnas with aaaa , cccc , gggg , or uuuu motifs and gc content < 20% or > 55% ; ( iii ) removes all candidates that have hamming distance < 2 to all potential off - target transcripts ; and ( iv ) returns a given number of remaining non - overlapping sirnas sorted by their predicted sirna knockdown efficacy .

 we identified klf4 and c - myc promoter - targeted sarna sequences that consistently induced increases in their respective levels of nascent mrna and protein expression in a time- and dose - dependent manner , as compared with scrambled sequence control oligonucleotides . 
 the functional consequences of sarna - induced activation of each targeted reprogramming factor were then characterized by comprehensively profiling changes in gene expression by microarray analysis , which revealed significant increases in mrna levels of their respective downstream pathway genes . 
 notably , the microarray profile after sarna - mediated induction of endogenous klf4 and c - myc showed similar gene expression patterns for stem cell- and cell cycle - related genes as compared with lentiviral vector - mediated overexpression of exogenous klf4 and c - myc transgenes , while divergent gene expression patterns common to viral vector - mediated transgene delivery were also noted . 
 the use of promoter - targeted sarnas for the activation of pluripotency reprogramming factors could have broad implications for stem cell research .",pubmed
"this process requires proliferation , differentiation and migration of neurogenic stem cells into neurons . for many decades 
 , it was believed that in mammals , neurogenesis occurs only during embryonic life , but a recent work has made it evident that neuronal regeneration occurs even after birth in specific tissues like the hippocampus , dentate gyrus , subventricular zone and olfactory epithelium ( 1 ) . 
 damage to the olfactory periphery destroys the population of olfactory sensory neurons and , in the case of direct epithelial lesion , also eliminates other constituents of the epithelium . in 
 marked contrast to other parts of the nervous system , there is substantial anatomical and functional recovery of the olfactory epithelium and its projection into the cns even in the face of overwhelming injury ( 2 ) . 
 years , neuroscience researchers have searched for an ideal cell with the properties of absolute totipotency and regenerability in vitro and in vivo . 
 science has come very close to the quest , but still many unanswered questions remain . 
 recent studies indicate that transplantation of pure stem cell population is insufficient for attaining the maximum positive effect of neural regeneration . 
 more complete recovery of the structure , sensory and motor functions of injured spinal cord can be attained using a complex of cells , including , apart from olfactory ensheathing cells ( oec ) , fibroblasts , astrocytes , schwann cells , and olfactory epithelial ( oe ) multipotent stem and progenitor cells . 
 hence , the problem of the efficiency and the possibility of using various oe cells and tissues for transplantation therapy in cerebral and spinal injuries doubtlessly requires further experimental studies . 
 nevertheless , consistent efforts with increasing optimistic outcome are being made to identify a candidate ( neuron- progenitor cell ) for a reliable therapeutic intervention of central nervous system ( cns ) injury . in this venture , recent years witnessed an increasing bang on the olfactory epithelium for suitable multipotent stem cells . 
 multiple numbers of pluripotent stem cell candidates have been tried in the past for neuro - regenerative therapies with unconvincing results ( 3 ) . 
 studies involving exposure of olfactory epithelium ( and causing its lesion ) to an irritant like methyl bromide ( mebr ) have shown that the olfactory epithelium is restored its normal status that is indistinguishable from unlesioned epithelium within 68 weeks after damage with no relation to the severity of the initial damage which could be up to 90% of the epithelium being destroyed . 
 the first sign of regeneration of olfactory neurons appears on the 4 day after mebr exposure , the first mature neurons emerge during the 2 week after which there is an accelerated production of neurons which falls to normal around the 6 week after the lesion ( 2 ) . 
 the reconstitution of the epithelium is sufficiently robust and precise so that the spatial distribution and the numbers of odorant receptors ( or ) are restored to normal ( 4 ) . 
 transplantation of adult animal and human oe cells have been used in the past for experimental and clinical correction of spinal injuries ( 5 ) . 
 the adult olfactory epithelium ( oe ) is a unique ( for its capacity to renew olfactory receptor neurons throughout adult life ) and a complex tissue containing heterogeneous population of epithelial cells . 
 apart from the support cells and neruoreceptor cells , this complex is said to retain a kind of progenitor cells that are competent to make neurons ( neural stem cells ) and non- neural support cells like olfactory ensheathing cells , oligodendrocytes and schwann cells ( 6 ) . 
 these support cells , play a role in the regeneration and myelination process of normal and of injured cns . 
 recent studies identified stem like characteristics in a group of cells called globose basal cells ( gbcs ) residing in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium . 
 the gbcs are the small , round , morphologically non - descript and cyto - keratin negative cells that sit between the horizontal basal cells ( hbcs ) below and the immature olfactory receptor neurons above , that proliferate at a high rate in the normal oe , are limited to the oe , and are poorly characterized at the level of their molecular phenotype . 
 further , a second population of cells that are called the hbcs with stem - cell like properties has been described to reside among the gbcs . 
 therefore , it appears that the olfactory epithelium contains at least two populations of cells with possible neuropotency ( 7 ) . 
 some studies have shown that there is an increase in the population of gbcs and not the hbcs during the regenerative process of the olfactory epithelium ( 8) . 
 gbcs function as broadly multipotent progenitors capable of giving rise to neurons and all of the cell types of the epithelium , and hence may be totipotent stem cells of the epithelium . 
 marker studies using antibodies that are selective for gbcs in normal epithelium , during the acute phase in the recovery after mebr exposure , suggest that the gbcs are differentiating into non - neuronal cell types ( 9 ) . 
 intranasal infusions of gbcs derived from retroviruses , give rise to neurons and multiple types of non - neuronal cells , while other stem cell progenitors give rise only to non - neuronal cells ( 10 ) . 
 gbcs that are separated from the normal epithelium by cell cytometry using a gbc - selective primary antibody and are pure and free from other cells and contaminants , engraft easily into the mebr - lesioned epithelium after infusion into the nasal cavity and give rise to most of the neural and non - neural cells present in the oe ( 11 ) . 
 embryonic stem cells ( 3 ) , haematopoetic stem cells and other mesenchymal stem cells have enormous ability to differentiate into different types of cells in the body ; but they are still the possibilities of immune rejection , adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy and many ethical issues which exclude them as an ideal candidate for clinical practice ( 12 ) . 
 moreover , these different varieties of stem cells do not reside in a niche similar to the neural stem cells and hence can not proliferate easily in the central nervous system . on the other hand , 
 olfactory epithelial cells share the same environmental niche as the central nervous system and also have the same developmental hierarchy as the neural cells . 
 olfactory mucosa is readily accessible , easily biopsied for autologous cell transplantation and regenerates completely without any loss of function . 
 these properties make the olfactory epithelial stem cells the ideal candidate for use in clinical research and therapy . 
 since the basal compartment contains two morphologically distinct cell types , horizontal basal cells ( hbcs ) and globose basal cells ( gbcs ) , there has been arguments regarding the identification of the neural stem cell population which can not be answered merely based on their location and mitotic activity and studies focusing on search for unique stem cell progenitor markers have to be undertaken ( 8 , 13 , 14 ) . 
 researchers in the recent years have proposed the most likely lineage of the cells in the olfactory epithelium by using specific markers , determination of various transcription factor expressions and incorporation of analytical studies using h - thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine which suggest the proliferative activity of dividing cells ( 15 , 16 ) . 
 it is now clear that immature orns are generated from one of the basal cell types and they in turn give rise to mature orns , but the identity of these cells has to be further characterised . only in limited experiments 
 , it has been shown that gbcs are the cell population to multiply and regenerate vigorously after epithelial damage . 
 there is still an uncertainty of the lineage relationship between the two basal cell populations . in this research 
 , we study different neural progenitor markers and ionic channels that are present on the gbcs and hence characterize these cells as definitive mutipotent stem cells residing in the basal compartment of rat olfactory epithelium capable of transforming into neurons and non - neuronal elements . 
 six albino wistar rats were purchased from the animal facility of christian medical college vellore after obtaining the clearance from the animal ethics committee . 
 albino wistar rats are the most commonly used laboratory animals for genetic and cell line studies as many aspects of their behaviour and physiology are similar to humans and this similarity can be easily observed in them when compared to other animals ( 17 ) . 
 this strain of rats was used in this study since their olfactory mucosa is easily accessible and their olfactory epithelium is histologically similar to that of the human . 
 all animals were weighed prior to the experimental ( 94 -120 g , with an average of 105 g ) . 
 the olfactory mucosa of the rats was obtained by surgical excision under complete , universal sterile conditions . 
 the albino wistar rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 90 mg / kg body weight of ketamine and 10 mg / kg body weight of xylazine . 
 the nasal septum was completely excised along three lines : the arc of the perpendicular plate , the cribriform plate and the ceiling of the oral cavity to obtain the olfactory mucosa ( figure 1 ) . 
 the nasal septum along with the olfactory mucosa was placed in frozen dulbeco s modified eagle s medium ( dmem ) containing antibiotics ( penicillin , streptomycin and amphotericin ) . 
 the nasal septum along with the olfactory mucosa was then treated with 0.5 ml of dispase ii and was incubated at 37c for 45 min . 
 the olfactory epithelium was separated from the lamina propria on both sides of the nasal septum using a micro spatula under a leica ez2hd dissecting microscope . 
 the olfactory mucosa was mechanically dissociated with a scalpel blade and treated with 0.05% trypsin and an enzymatic cocktail containing collagenase 1 mg / ml , hyaluronidase 1.5 mg / ml and trypsin inhibitor  0.1 mg / ml to separate the cells . 
 the oe cells were transferred to epithelial culture medium which was modified form of the previously described medium ( 18 - 20 ) . 
 the culture medium was composed of dmem / f12 ( 1 : 1 ) 47.5 ml , 2% fetal bovine serum ( invitrogen , gibco , india ) 
 1.0 ml , n2 supplement ( invitrogen , gibco , india ) 0.5 ml , epidermal growth factor ( 25 ng / ml  invitrogen , gibco , india ) 12.5 l and l - glutamine ( invitrogen , gibco , india ) 0.5 ml .

 om - olfactory mucosa ( yellowish ) , rm - respiratory mucosa ( pinkish ) ten l of gbc iii antibody was added to the epithelial cell pellet under dark conditions and was left in ice for 45 min . 
 gbc - iii is a mouse monoclonal igm antibody which recognizes a 40 kda surface antigen which is a laminin receptor surface protein . 
 it is highly specific as a marker for gbcs , unlike the earlier antibodies used like gbc - i which were nonspecific markers for gbcs and showed positive reaction even with hbcs , sus and duct cells ( 21 ) . 
 gbc - iii in powdered form was reconstituted into the recommended volume of 250 l . 
 ten l of r - phycoerythrin - conjugated affinipure ( fab)2 fragment goat anti - mouse igm ( secondary antibody ) was added to the cell pellet and left under dark conditions in ice for 10 min . 
 fluorescence assisted cell sorting ( facs ) was used to separate the gbcs from other epithelial cells . 
 finally , 99% pure gbcs were obtained using facs and gbc - iii antibody and were plated in the epithelial medium . 
 gbc cell suspension in the epithelial medium was washed 3 times with hanks balanced salt solution . 
 cells were trypsinised using 100 l of 0.1% trypsin / edta and incubated at 37c for 5 min . 
 epithelial medium was added immediately after incubation to neutralize the enzymes and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 8 min . 
 a poly d - lysine plated cover slip was placed in a 35 mm petridish . 
 the cell suspension was then plated on this cover slip and incubated for 2 hr . 
 micropipettes were prepared using f-500 fine point microforge to have the tip diameter of 1 micron . 
 the cover slip coated with the cells was washed with ecf ( extra cellular fluid ) and was placed in a 35 mm petridish filled with ecf . 
 composition of the neuron solution ecf was nacl  135 mm , kcl  4 mm , nah2po4  1 mm , cacl2 1.2 mm , mgcl2  0.5 mm , hepes  10 mm and glucose  10 mm . 
 all the micropipettes were filled with icf ( intra cellular fluid ) before being attached to the pipette electrode . 
 composition of the neuron solution icf was kcl  140 mm , egta  1 mm , mgcl2  1 mm , hepes  10 mm and glucose - 10 mm . 
 the petridish was placed on the stage of a phase contrast microscope and the bath electrode was introduced into the ecf . 
 the micropipette tip was gently approximated to the cell membrane of the gbc and a negative suction was given to form a seal . 
 the average seal resistance for the gbcs was between 1.2 m ohm and 2 m ohm . 
 multiple sweeps were taken to calculate the current flow and analysed using the clampex scope episodic software . 
 immunostaining of pure gbcs was done with multiple numbers of neural progenitor stem cell markers to characterize gbcs as neural progenitor cells . 
 primary antibodies used for immunostaining were anti - ncam , anti - nestin , anti - sox-1 , anti - sox-2 , anti - cd29 , anti - cd54 and anti - cd73 . 
 secondary antibodies used were goat anti - mouse igg 1 and goat ant - rabbit igg ( percp - conjugated affinipure f(ab)2 fragment ) . 
 cover slips ( coated with poly d - lysine ) plated with the gbcs were washed in pbs 3 times . 
 cover slips were placed on the slides and blocked using 2% goat serum ( blocking agent ) mixed with 0.1 % triton x ( permeating agent ) for 2 hr at room temperature . after blocking , the slides were washed 3 times with pbs and treated with the primary antibodies and incubated overnight at 4c . 
 dilutions used for different primary antibodies were as follows ; anti ncam- 1:50 , anti nestin- 1:20 , anti sox 1- 1:100 , anti sox 2- 1:5 , anti cd29- 1:50 , anti cd54- 1:50 and anti cd73- 1:50 .

 the basal cells in the olfactory epithelium are believed to be the easily accessible autologous stem cells in the adults . 
 however selection and isolation of the specific basal cells which are progenitors for neural cells are still being studied . 
 the present research work helped us to isolate and decipher numerous new facts about the globose basal stem cells in the olfactory epithelium of rats . 
 culture medium used for growing and obtaining maximum confluency of the olfactory epithelial cells was standardized . 
 the epithelial medium was composed of chemicals , enzymes and factors essential for epithelial cell proliferation and neurosphere formation . 
 the desirable viable cell density for obtaining optimum growth of epithelial cells on the media was calculated to be 10  10 . 
 phase contrast image showing 2 generation of neurospheres on the 14 day in epithelial medium as it is shown in figure 3 , 99% pure gbcs were obtained using facs and gbc - iii antibody . 
 the highest number of gbcs was found in the area with the total cell density of 4  10 ( figures 4 and 5 ) .

 immunostaining of gbcs was positive with anti - ncam ( figure 6 , va ) , anti - nestin ( figure 6 , vb ) and anti - sox 2 ( figure 6 , vc ) , hence confirming that these cells contain intracellular proteins like ncam , nestin and sox 2 and are neural progenitor cells . 
 gbcs staining was also positive for cd-29 ( figure 6 , vd ) , cd-54 ( figure 6 , ve ) and cd-73 ( figure 6 , vf ) which are cell surface markers present on a variety of cells including neural progenitor cells . 
 marker study with sox-1 was negative probably because of reduced number of gbc in that respective well . 
 electrophysiological characterisation of the isolated gbcs was done using patch clamping ( figure 7 ) . 
 whole cell voltage - clamp recording from gbc was obtained using 60% series resistance compensation , following correction . 
 also , + 1 mv increments were applied starting from -40 mv to -10 mv to check for opening of any voltage gated na ( sodium ) channels . 
 voltage gated na channels were completely absent , hence proving the unexcitable nature of gbcs ( figure 8) . 
 then , + 10mv increments were applied starting from -150 mv to + 150 mv to check for opening of any voltage gated k ( potassium ) channels . 
 a smooth i - v curve was not obtained and only leaky k channels were found to be present on the gbc which was of no significance ( figure 9 ) .

 neurogenesis begins in the early embryonic period ( 4 week ) and continues 10 to 12 years after birth ( 22 ) . 
 the nervous system development is completed only during the adolescent period when myelination of the neurons of major tracts is completed ( 23 ) . 
 early researchers believed the nervous system to be fixed and incapable of proliferation and regeneration based on the their opinions that neurons and non - neuronal cells in the nervous system could not divide actively via mitosis and they lacked the potential to transform from simple to more complex forms of neuronal morphologies . 
 another reason for such belief was inability of researchers in the past to demonstrate progenitor stem cells residing in the nervous system niche by specific markers . 
 cells in the nervous system could be demonstrated only by negative staining which was very non - specific ( 18 , 22 , 23 ) . 
 the earliest demonstration of neurogenesis in adults was done by joseph altman in 1962 in the cerebral cortex ( 24 ) followed by demonstration of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in 1963 ( 25 ) . 
 later , it was evident that neurogenesis also occurred in the subgranular zone and subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles ( 26 ) . 
 now , researchers also believe that neurogenesis continues in the cerebellum during adulthood ( 27 ) . 
 the most recent development in this field of research is the demonstration of neurogenesis in the olfactory system including the olfactory bulbs and more importantly in the olfactory mucosa . 
 this research work studies one such population of stem cells residing in the olfactory epithelium which has the niche required to get accepted in the cns environment and is derived from the same germ line as the neuronal cells . 
 this gives a hint that these might be the ideal neural progenitor cells which can be easily harvested and used for autologous transplantations . 
 olfactory epithelial- mesenchymal stem cells have been isolated in the past from the olfactory mucosa using enzymatic dissociation with collagenase ia ( 28 ) in an impure form . 
 isolated cultures of gbcs and horizontal basal cells have been grown in earlier experiments by immunoadhesion ( 29).this research work standardizes chemical methods to isolate these stem cells from the olfactory epithelium in a pure form . 
 epithelial cells were harvested on the culture media after calculating the feasible cell densities for optimal growth and neurosphere formation . 
 densities higher than this resulted in overcrowding of cells and loss of cells due to unwanted cell death 
 . densities lower than this did not provide us with adequate number of cells and hindered neurosphere generation . 
 the self renewal potential of olfactory stem cells was evident from the formation of multiple generations of neurospheres . 
 egf and n-2 supplement seem to play a significant role in providing an optimum external niche for formation of multiple generations of neurospheres from epithelial stem cells . 
 egf is a potential stem cell mitogen allowing cell proliferation through activating signalling pathway and inducing the production of beta fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) from the progenitor cells . 
 olfactory mucosa in cultures has been shown to produce certain soluble factors which help with proliferation , regeneration and neurosphere formation ( 30 ) . 
 the area p1 was chosen with relatively higher percentage of gbc - iii stained cells and a graph was plotted showing the gbc density to be 65.3% of the total number of cells . 
 p2 , a part of p1 , with the highest cell density was chosen and a similar graph was plotted which showed the gbc density to be 79.9% of the total ( figure 4 ) . 
 . an insignificant number of 41 positive cells ( accounting for 0.4% of the total ) were sorted from the negative control proving the efficacy of the procedure ( figure 5 ) . 
 gbcs have been isolated in the past from other progenitor cells of the olfactory epithelium using facs by tagging them with less sensitive and specific antibodies like gbc - i ( 9 ) and gbc - ii ( 29 ) . 
 the complexities of the phenotypical stages of transformation of the gbcs into olfactory neurons upon neuroablation of the olfactory bulb have been explained using enhanced green[t6 ] fluorescent protein tagged with markers like sox2 and neurog1 ( 31 ) 
 . further research on gbcs and other potential neural progenitor cells present in the olfactory mucosa will help us to understand their biology and effectiveness in neurogenesis . 
 it will also help to apply these results to medical use for therapeutic treatment of different diseases . 
 few areas on which special attention can be drawn in future are : 
 isolation of gbcs from the oe using magnetic assisted cell sorting ( macs ) . 
 hence , its usage will help us to compare its efficacy with facs and a better purity of cells can be obtained ( 32).electrophysiological studies to find out more about different ion channels present on the gbcs will help us to have a better understanding of the functional properties of these cells and their drug interactions.animal studies using gbcs to repair the spinal cord injuries and other nervous system disorders should be the ultimate aim to propagate and effectively utilize the present knowledge on these cells in human trials .

 animal studies using gbcs to repair the spinal cord injuries and other nervous system disorders should be the ultimate aim to propagate and effectively utilize the present knowledge on these cells in human trials . 
 this research work has been able to throw some light on the prevailing ambiguity of the olfactory stem cells and has derived some definite conclusions about the nature and behaviour of these cells . 
 non - excitable nature of gbcs has been documented in the present study . positive expression of all the neural progenitor cell markers has proved substantially about the neuro - transformation capability of the gbcs . 
 now , after undertaking this study , we can conclude with concrete explanations that gbcs are the colony of neural stem cells residing in the basal compartment of the olfactory epithelium responsible for the ongoing neurogenesis in the oe throughout adult life .","objective(s):in the past few decades , variety of foetal , embryonic and adult stem and progenitor cells have been tried with conflicting outcome for cell therapy of central nervous system injury and diseases . 
 cellular characteristics and functional plasticity of globose basal stem cells ( gbcs ) residing in the olfactory epithelium of rat olfactory mucosa have not been studied in the past by the neuroscientists due to unavailability of specific markers for gbcs . in the present research , we standardized some techniques to isolate gbcs from rat olfactory epithelium in pure form using a highly selective gbc - iii antibody passaged through fluorescence activated cell sorter ( facs ) . 
 we also characterized these cells immunohistologically using various pluripotent stem cell markers . 
 this work also throws some light on ionic channels present on these stem cells which are responsible for their neuron induction potential.materials and methods : globose basal stem cells were isolated from rat olfactory epithelium using gbc - iii antibody and were characterized as multipotent stem cells using various neural progenitor markers . 
 ionic channels on gbcs were studied with voltage clamping.results:gbcs could be isolated in pure ( 99% purity ) form and were found to be stained positive for all neural progenitor cell markers . 
 voltage gated na+ channels were completely absent , which proves the unexcitable nature of gbcs . 
 leaky k+ channels were found to be present on the gbc which was of no significance.conclusion:this research work can be helpful in understanding the nature of these stem cells and utilising them in future as potent candidates for neuro - regenerative therapies .",pubmed

 data were not available to evaluate the effects of birth cohort , timing of surgery , or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with rrso . 
 to identify all reports of rrso in brca1/2 mutation carriers , we searched the pubmed database using the search terms  oophorectomy  and  brca1  or  brca2 . 
 this search yielded 346 studies that were published between january 1999 and december 2007 : 309 that included the term  brca1  in the title and 267 that included the term 
 we then evaluated the full text of these citations to identify articles presenting primary data that provided estimates of risk reduction due to rrso . 
 no publications were excluded based on quality , sample size , language of publication , or other objective criteria related to study design and analysis . 
 however , some publications that reported rrso in brca1/2 mutation carriers were not included because they did not estimate risk reduction . 
 these included case reports , psychosocial or behavioral studies , commentaries , and clinical recommendations . 
 because the number of brca1/2 mutation carriers is relatively limited and most research groups studying these women are in routine communication and collaborate with one another , we also undertook personal communications with all of the researchers or consortia that have large series of brca1/2 mutation carriers and were known to have data that could have been used to report data on this topic . 
 we undertook a fixed - effects meta - analysis using the hazard ratios ( hrs ) and/or odds ratios ( as published in the original reports ) to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) . 
 when two or more studies had overlapping study samples , we included only one published report from each group . 
 of the studies identified here , sample overlaps were noted in the studies of rebbeck et al . 
 ( 16 ) , which had the largest sample size of these five studies , was chosen for inclusion in the meta - analysis . 
 there were no apparent overlaps among the other datasets , although we can not rule out the possibility that a few individuals had participated in more than one study . 
 we carried out separate meta - analyses in brca1 mutation carriers , brca2 mutation carriers , and among women who carried either brca1 or brca2 mutations ( denoted brca1/2 ) . 
 a chi - square test of homogeneity among the individual risk ratio estimates of the identified studies was also performed . to evaluate potential for publication bias 
 , we used the adjusted rank correlation test of begg and mazumdar ( 20 ) . 
 all analyses were conducted using stata / se v9.0 ( statcorp , college station , tx ) .

 we undertook a fixed - effects meta - analysis using the hazard ratios ( hrs ) and/or odds ratios ( as published in the original reports ) to estimate the pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) . 
 when two or more studies had overlapping study samples , we included only one published report from each group . 
 of the studies identified here , sample overlaps were noted in the studies of rebbeck et al . 
 ( 16 ) , which had the largest sample size of these five studies , was chosen for inclusion in the meta - analysis . 
 there were no apparent overlaps among the other datasets , although we can not rule out the possibility that a few individuals had participated in more than one study . 
 we carried out separate meta - analyses in brca1 mutation carriers , brca2 mutation carriers , and among women who carried either brca1 or brca2 mutations ( denoted brca1/2 ) . 
 a chi - square test of homogeneity among the individual risk ratio estimates of the identified studies was also performed . to evaluate potential for publication bias 
 , we used the adjusted rank correlation test of begg and mazumdar ( 20 ) . 
 all analyses were conducted using stata / se v9.0 ( statcorp , college station , tx ) . 
 the studies that formed the basis of this meta - analysis included case  control studies as well as prospective and retrospective cohort studies ( table 1 ) . as can be seen in this summary , limitations of the currently available data regarding rrso in brca1/2 mutation carriers include variable study designs , small sample sizes for individual studies , many of which are retrospective in nature , and short post - rrso follow - up times in prospective studies . 
 eight studies ( 8 - 10,12 - 16 ) estimated the risk of breast cancer in brca1/2 mutation carriers who were treated with rrso relative to brca1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment ( table 2 ) . as summarized in table 3 and figure 1 , 
 three nonoverlapping studies ( 1416 ) , which included 5703 participants , estimated the risk of breast cancer in brca1/2 mutation carriers who received rrso relative to brca1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive the procedure , giving a summary hr estimate of 0.49 ( 95% ci = 0.37 to 0.65 ) . 
 four nonoverlapping studies ( 12,1416 ) estimated the risk reduction associated with rrso for breast cancer in brca1 mutation carriers , giving a summary hr estimate of 0.47 ( 95% ci = 0.35 to 0.64 ) . finally , three nonoverlapping studies ( 1416 ) estimated the relative risk for breast cancer in brca2 mutation carriers , giving a summary hr estimate of 0.47 ( 95% ci = 0.26 to 0.84 ) ( table 3 , figure 1 ) 
 . published studies of risk - reducing salpingo - oophorectomy and cancer risk in brca1/2 mutation carriers * in all but one of the prospective cohort studies , women with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer were included for the ovarian endpoint . in domchek 
 et al . ( 13 ) all patients were unaffected with breast or ovarian cancer at the start of follow - up , as the study was designed to evaluate the impact of rrso on cancer incidence as well as disease - specific and overall survival .

 the prospective and retrospective cohorts were analyzed by survival / failure time analysis methods ; the case  control studies were analyzed by logistic regression . 
 six studies ( 8,10,11,13,16,17 ) ( table 2 ) estimated the risk of gynecologic cancer in brca1/2 mutation carriers treated with rrso relative to brca1/2 mutation carriers who did not receive this treatment . based on data from the three nonoverlapping datasets ( 11,16,17 ) , which included 2840 participants , the summary hr was 0.21 ( 95% ci = 0.12 to 0.39 ) ( table 3 , figure 1 ) . only one study ( 16 ) estimated the risk of gynecologic cancer in brca1 mutation carriers treated with rrso relative to untreated brca1 carriers ( hr = 0.15 , 95% ci = 0.04 to 0.56 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 ( 16 ) did investigate risk reduction in 294 women with brca2 mutations , but observed no post - rrso gynecologic cancers in this sample . 
 published studies of risk - reducing salpingo - oophorectomy and cancer risk in brca1/2 mutation carriers * hazard ratios ( hrs ) , odds ratios ( ors ) ( with 95% confidence intervals ) , and sample size ( n ) are presented . 
 na = not applicable . not included in summary hr estimate because the sample set overlaps with that of other reports . 
 studies included in the summary estimate were chosen to maximize the sample size ( power ) of the meta - analysis . 
 we found no evidence of publication bias of any of our estimates based on the begg and majumder test statistics presented in table 3 . 
 no evidence of study heterogeneity was found based on the x test ( table 3 ) . 
 summary estimates for ovarian / fallopian tube cancer and breast cancer risk reduction associated with salpingo - oophorectomy in brca1/2 mutation carriers * na = not applicable ; hr = hazard ratio ; ci = confidence interval . according to begg and mazumder ( 20 ) . 
 the clinical management of cancer risk in brca1 and brca2 mutation carriers is complex and should consider patient preferences ; these preferences can be informed by accurate knowledge of the risks and benefits of the interventions considered ( table 4 ) . 
 the results of our meta - analysis suggest an 80% reduction in ovarian / fallopian tube cancer risk and a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk associated with rrso in women who carry mutations in brca1 or brca2 . 
 the consistency of these findings across the included studies confirms the strong association of rrso with reduced risks of breast and ovarian cancer in brca1 or brca2 mutation carriers . 
 in addition , modeling studies have also demonstrated that salpingo - oophorectomy has a large effect on years of life added , particularly when adjusted for quality of life ( 31 ) . 
 furthermore , in a prospective study with short - term follow - up , rrso was associated with a 90% reduction in breast cancer  specific mortality , a 95% reduction in gynecologic cancer  specific mortality , and a 76% reduction in overall mortality ( 13 ) . 
 therefore , all of the available data demonstrate the utility of salpingo - oophorectomy in this population of patients . 
 synopsis of management strategies available to brca1 and brca2 mutation carriers * rrso = risk - reducing salpingo - oophorectomy ; er = estrogen receptor ; mri = magnetic resonance imaging . despite the consistent evidence favoring rrso in women with mutations in brca1 or brca2 , 
 first , the influence of cohort effects on cancer risk over time remain unclear , despite evidence that differences in risk over time may reflect changing exposures , lifestyle , reproductive history , and use of screening or preventive surgeries ( 32 ) . 
 we lacked the data necessary to evaluate the effects of birth cohort , timing of surgery , or other factors that may influence the risk reduction estimates associated with rrso . 
 therefore , at this time it is difficult to infer whether specific cohorts , exposure groups , or other strata may experience different risk reduction effects than others . to limit the possibility that reporting bias influenced our findings 
 however , we did not include any studies that reported the association of rrso with cancer risk without providing estimates of risk reduction because these data would not contribute to pooled estimates of risk reduction . because some studies included in the this analysis were limited in sample size and statistical power , their effect estimates for rrso were large but not statistically significant , suggesting that a meta - analysis and presentation of summary statistics was appropriate . 
 two studies ( 15,17 ) were included in the summary estimates even though they used case  control designs , and therefore they yielded odds ratios rather than hazard ratios . 
 although odds ratios may slightly overestimate the risk reduction associated with rrso , the annual incidence of ovarian and breast cancer in brca1/2 mutation carriers is no more than 2%4% , with the result that odds ratios are likely to be similar to hazard ratios in this setting . 
 some of the variability in the individual study estimates reported may reflect study design differences , including the use of retrospective vs prospective samples and poorly characterized selection biases . despite these differences , we noted no statistically significant heterogeneity in the estimates of risk reduction after rrso . 
 in addition , cohort studies estimated a greater reduction in cancer risk associated with rrso ( particularly ovarian / fallopian tube cancers ) compared with the case  control studies ( table 1 ) . 
 as a result , there is some variability in the estimates obtained using case  control and cohort studies ; nonetheless , the estimates all consistently reflect risk reduction associated with rrso . 
 we have included all of the large collaborative group studies that addressed the question of reduced risk conferred by rrso and whose study populations come from and are representative of mutation carriers in north america and europe . 
 no studies of rrso in nonwhite populations have been reported , and additional data may be needed to understand the role of rrso in these groups . finally , the samples of women with brca1/2 mutations reported here represent those who have generally been identified through high - risk clinics . 
 however , they do represent the population of women who receive genetic testing and may be candidates for rrso . 
 therefore , the populations summarized here represent the most relevant group in whom rrso may be applied at this time . despite the strength and consistency of the data in the literature as reflected in our meta - analysis , a number of questions remain . 
 there are only a few estimates of the association of rrso with cancer risk in populations composed exclusively of brca1 mutation carriers or brca2 mutation carriers ( 12,1416 ) , and it is critical to understand how risk reduction may differ by gene . using a prospective cohort approach and a large consortium dataset , we recently estimated gene - specific risks and found that hormonal modulation by rrso may be associated with a greater reduction in breast cancer risk in brca2 mutation carriers than in brca1 mutation carriers ( 16 ) . 
 in contrast , the studies that used retrospective cohort ( 14 ) or case  control approaches ( 14,15 ) did not observe this difference , and therefore , there was no difference in the pooled estimates of breast cancer risk reduction reported in table 1 . 
 thus , differences in study design may influence the inferences we can make about the differences in risk reduction associated with rrso in brca1 vs brca2 mutation carriers . 
 the potentially larger risk reduction associated with rrso in brca2 vs brca1 mutation carriers is of interest , given the high proportion of estrogen receptor ( er)negative breast tumors in brca1 mutation carriers compared with brca2 mutation carriers ( 33 ) . 
 our observation of a higher risk in brca2 mutation carriers should be followed up in larger studies that specifically evaluate tumor markers . 
 in addition , attention needs to be given to the time interval between rrso and breast cancer diagnosis . 
 for example , it is possible that there is greater breast cancer risk reduction in brca2 mutation carriers , in whom the majority of tumors are er positive , given that rrso may treat some subclinical breast tumors . 
 in contrast , in brca1 mutation carriers , who have predominantly er - negative breast cancer , it is unclear whether a  treatment effect  may exist , and any primary prevention effect may require more time to emerge . 
 eisen et al . ( 15 ) reported that the breast cancer risk reduction with rrso was greater in brca1/2 mutation carriers who underwent surgery before age 50 than in women who underwent surgery after age 50 . among brca1 mutation carriers older than age 50 , 
 no statistically significant association of rrso at any age with risk reduction was observed in brca2 mutation carriers . although these findings are consistent with effects of removal of hormone exposures in premenopausal women and not in postmenopausal women , the sample sizes in this analysis ( 15 ) were relatively small . 
 the importance of understanding the optimal age at which a woman should consider rrso is underscored by a recent study ( 34 ) conducted in the general population that suggests that rrso in women younger than age 45 is associated with an increased mortality , particularly if hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ) is not used . 
 an initial report of hrt use after rrso suggests that women can undergo rrso and take hrt for a short time if needed after surgery because breast cancer risk is not substantially elevated in hrt users after rrso ( 35 ) . 
 although data on postmenopausal women do not demonstrate a cardiovascular benefit from hrt ( 36 ) , an important limitation of this study ( 36 ) was the older age of the participants . 
 more recent data have suggested that younger women going through natural menopause may indeed derive a cardiovascular benefit from hrt ( 36,37 ) , and it is possible that brca1/2 mutation carriers undergoing abrupt surgical menopause to reduce ovarian cancer risk who receive hrt may in fact derive important cardiovascular , bone health , and quality - of - life benefits . although the risk  benefit ratio of rrso is very different in brca1/2 mutation carriers than in the general population , and rrso in brca1/2 mutation carriers has been associated with improved overall survival in the short term , these studies pointing to the potentially complex relationship of rrso and hrt exposure raise important and difficult questions . 
 for example , it is not yet clear whether the long - term effects of long - term hrt in unaffected mutation brca1/2 carriers will ultimately be more beneficial in preventing noncancer mortality in these women or more harmful by increasing their risk of breast cancer ( or potentially increasing cardiovascular events ) compared with the general population . given this possibility , studies that address the type , timing , and length of administration of hrt as well as its long - term effects on the association between rrso and cancer risk and on other health factors in brca1/2 mutation carriers 
 , we provide a summary of clinical recommendations related to the detection and prevention of cancer in brca1/2 mutation carriers ( table 4 ) . 
 finally , although rrso has become the standard of care for cancer risk reduction in women who have inherited brca1/2 mutations , other options for risk reduction also exist . 
 women with brca1/2 mutations who have been treated with risk - reducing mastectomy have a substantially reduced breast cancer risk ( 30 ) . 
 furthermore , a study of breast cancer screening that added yearly magnetic resonance imaging to screening mammography suggested that combination of these modalities may also have benefit in the early detection of breast cancer in this group of women ( 28 ) . in conclusion , the summary risk reduction estimates presented here confirm that brca1/2 mutation carriers who have been treated with rrso have a substantially reduced risk of both breast and ovarian cancer . 
 therefore , additional cancer risk reduction and screening strategies are required to maximally reduce cancer incidence and mortality in this high - risk population .

"oral lichen planus ( olp ) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa , with a prevalence of about 1~2% of the population [ 1 , 2 ] . 
 once established , the lesions rarely undergo self - remission and , in some cases , have a malignant potency . 
 histologically , olp is characterized by a dense subepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes , increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes , and the degeneration of basal keratinocytes . 
 the lymphocytic infiltrate consists predominantly of t cells [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . 
 although the etiology of olp remains unclear , accumulating evidence supports a role of immune dysregulation in the pathogenesis of olp , especially involving a t - cell - mediated immune response and the abnormal production of various inflammatory molecules [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] . 
 previous studies have identified that a variety of proinflammatory molecules are aberrantly synthesized and secreted by both infiltrated t cells and altered keratinocytes in the lesions of olp , which contribute to the onset and persistence of the inflammatory responses [ 712 ] . 
 these findings indicated that olp lesion development is closely associated with the activation , production , and functions of these inflammatory molecules . 
 the interleukin- ( il- ) 23/il-17 axis is a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway , in which il-23 and il-17 are two pivotal cytokines [ 13 , 14 ] . 
 il-23 is a heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokine , which is composed of a unique p19 subunit and a common p40 subunit shared with il-12 . 
 secreted by various cell types , such as activated dentritic cells , macrophages , and epithelium , il-23 functions as an important driving factor in the immune response . 
 notably , il-23 serves an essential role in induction and maintenance of a novel subset of cd4+th cells , namely , th17 [ 16 , 17 ] . 
 in addition , il-23 also induces th17 to produce its distinctive cytokine il-17 , which is composed of two il-17a subunits [ 18 , 19 ] . 
 subsequently , il-17 functions as a proinflammatory cytokine , which can activate different cells such as epithelial , endothelial , fibroblast , chondrocyte , and osteoblast to produce numerous inflammatory molecules including cytokines , chemokines , defensins , and mmps [ 20 , 21 ] . together with these downstream proinflammatory products , 
 the il-23/il-17 axis is extensively involved in the processes of chronic inflammation within various pathological states . 
 the il-23/il-17 axis has recently been described to play a major role in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory and immune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , psoriasis , atopic dermatitis , inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , and periodontitis [ 2229 ] . in our previous study , we have detected the serum and saliva levels of il-17 in olp patients but found no significant difference compared to healthy groups . in others ' investigation , the presence of il-17 has been found in the lesions of olp , suggesting its role in the local environments . 
 however , till now , the role of il-23/il-17 axis in the pathogenesis of olp is still unclear . 
 the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns and regulatory roles of il-23/il-17 axis in olp . 
 all tissue and blood specimens of olp patients and healthy volunteers were obtained from west china school and hospital of stomatology , sichuan university . 
 the olp cases were clinically diagnosed , pathologically confirmed , and subdivided as reticular or erosive forms based on the modified who diagnostic criteria of olp . 
 subjects with other oral or systematic diseases or taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs within 3 months prior to the specimen collection were excluded from the recruitment . for immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) staining , 27 olp lesion specimens , including 13 with erosive form and 14 with reticular form , were recruited from the archives of the department of pathology , and 10 normal oral mucosa ( nom ) tissues were collected from healthy volunteers receiving orthognathic surgery . for quantitative pcr analyses , 14 reticular olp and 
 10 nom tissues were obtained during the biopsy or orthognathic surgery , respectively , and subsequently snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen for the following experiment procedure . for studying the effect of il-23 on the cd4+t cells , 
 written informed consent was obtained from each subject , and the whole experiment procedure was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and approved by the scientific and ethical committee board of sichuan university . 
 paraffin - embedded sections of olp lesion specimens and nom tissues were treated in xylene and hydrated in graded ethanol , followed by blocking the activity of endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide . 
 after antigen retrieval by heat and press , the sections were incubated with goat anti - human il-17 monoclonal antibody ( 1  :  100 , r&d systems , usa ) or rabbit anti - human il-23p19 monoclonal antibody ( 1  :  100 , abcam , uk ) overnight at 4c . 
 subsequently , sections were incubated with the rabbit anti - goat lgg antibody - hrp polymer or goat anti - rabbit lgg antibody - hrp polymer detection reagent ( zsgb biotechnology , beijing , china ) for 15 minutes at room temperature and then 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( dab ) for 1 - 2 minutes . 
 the expression of il-23p19 subunit was assessed using an arbitrary scoring system as follows : 0 , no staining ; 1 , very weak staining ( 15 cells per section ) ; 2 , weak staining ( 530 cells per section ) ; 3 , moderate staining ( 30100 cells per section ) ; 4 , strong staining ( 100400 cells per section ) ; and 5 , strong staining ( > 400 cells per section ) . 
 the expression activities were assessed as previously described [ 33 , 34 ] . to evaluate the expression of il-17 , 
 five high power fields ( hpf ) at a magnification of 400 were randomly picked up and the numbers of il-17 + cells were counted separately . the average number of il-17 + cells per field was then calculated and compared . 
 five milliliters of heparinized blood was obtained from 10 olp patients , respectively . the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) 
 subsequently , cd4+t helper ( th ) cells were purified by anti - human cd4 magnetic particles ( bd biosciences , usa ) on a cell separation magnet ( bd biosciences , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 the purified cd4+th cells were resuspended at a density of 1  10 cells / ml rpml 1640 medium ( thermo scientific hyclone , beijing , china ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; gibco , grand island , ny , usa ) . for activation of cd4+th cells , 10  g / ml of purified mouse anti - human cd3 antibody ( bd pharmingen , usa ) and 5  g / ml of purified mouse anti - human cd28 antibody ( bd pharmingen , usa ) were added . to study the effect of il-23 on the cd4+th cells 
 , the cells were cultured with or without recombinant human il-23 ( ril-23 , 20  ng / ml ; r&d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) for 36 hours . 
 subsequently , cells and culture supernatant were collected separately for the following intracellular cytokine staining and elisa detection . for intracellular cytokine staining 
 , collected peripheral blood cd4+th cells were resuspended at a density of 1  10 cells / ml and stimulated in rpml 1640 medium containing phorbol myristate acetate ( ( pma ) , 50  ng / ml , sigma ) , ionomycin ( 1  g / ml , sigma ) , and monensin ( 0.67  g / ml , goldistop , bd pharmingen , usa ) for 4 hours . after that , cells were stained using a cytofix / cytoperm fixation / permeabilization solution kit ( bd pharmingen , usa ) , anti - human cd4 percp - cy5.5 antibody ( bd pharmingen , usa ) , and anti - human il-17 ape antibody ( bd pharmingen , usa ) , successively , according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 stained cells were analyzed using the facsaria flow cytometer and bd facsdiva software ( bd biosciences , san diego , ca , usa ) . 
 the concentration of il-17 in the culture supernatants of peripheral blood cd4+th cells was measured using a human il-17 elisa kit ( boster , wuhan , china ) . according to the manufacturer 's instructions , 
 the detectable range of il-17 content was from 31.2 to 2000  pg / ml . 
 hok16e6e7 , a human immortalized oral keratinocyte cell line , was plated in 6-well plates ( 2  10/well ) in keratinocyte serum - free medium ( ksfm , gibco brl life technologies , grand island , ny , usa ) containing supplemented with epidermal growth factor and calcium . after 24 hours ' growth , medium with different doses of recombinant human il-17 ( rhil-17 , 020  ng / ml ; r&d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) or medium only was placed . 
 after another 24 hours ' culture , the cells were collected and kept in 70c until the rna isolation . 
 total rna was isolated from 14 reticular olp and 10 nom tissue specimens or the cultured cells using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) . 
 cdna was synthesized from 400  ng of rna using the primescript rt reagent kit ( takara biotechnology , dalian , china ) . 
 primers purchased from takara biotechnology were listed in table 2 . to avoid the amplification of genome dna , all the primers 
 the real - time quantitative pcr on 10  ng of cdna was performed using the sybr green detection assay on an applied biosystems 7300 real - time pcr system . 
 the amplification procedure consisted of 10  s at 95c , followed by 40 cycles of the amplification procedure composed of 95c for 5  s and 62c for 40  s. each sample was run in triplicate . 
 the relative gene expression normalized to the expression of gapdh housekeeping gene and control sample were analyzed by the ct method . 
 kruskal - wallis test and mann - whitney test were used to determine differences between groups , paired t - test was used for the pair comparison , and spearman 's test was used to analyze the correlations . 
 to identify whether il-23/il-17 is involved in the local pathogenesis of olp , we firstly detected the expression and distribution of il-23 p19 , a unique subunit of il-23 , and il-17 in olp lesions and nom tissues . using ihc detection , we observed diffuse and strong expressions of il-23p19 in both erosive and reticular olp lesions . 
 the positive staining of il-23p19 predominantly concentrated on the epithelium of olp lesions and also on the extracellular matrix of the lamina propria ( figures 1(a)1(d ) ) . 
 in contrast , only a few keratinocytes in the epidermis layer of the nom tissues showed weak stain of il-23p19 ( figures 1(e ) and 1(f ) ) . 
 moreover , we found abundant il-17 positive stainings on the cytoplasm of the infiltrated lymphocytes in the lesions of both erosive and reticular olp , but only a few sporadic il-17 + cells in the normal oral mucosa ( figures 1(g)1(l ) ) . 
 the statistical data showed that both the erosive and reticular olp lesions had significantly increased immunostaining scores of il-23p19 , as well as the numbers of il-17 + cells , compared to the normal oral mucosa . 
 in addition , erosive olp lesions contained a significantly increased number of il-17 + cells compared to the reticular olp lesions . 
 however , there is no significant difference in il-23p19 staining score between erosive and the reticular olp lesions ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . to verify the ihc results 
 , we also detected the mrna expressions of both subunits of il-23 ( il-23p19 and il-12p40 ) and il-17 in 14 reticular olp lesional tissues and 10 nom tissues and found that the mrna expressions of all the three genes in olp lesions were significantly increased compared to nom tissues ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . 
 these data demonstrated overexpression of il-23 and il-17 in the olp lesions , indicating that the il-23/il-17 axis may be involved in the local immune network of olp . 
 considering il-23 as an important upstream inducing cytokine of il-17 , we next investigated whether the upregulation of il-23 in the progress of olp lesion is associated with the increased expression of il-17 . analyzing based on the data above 
 , we found no correlation between the il-23p19 staining scores and the numbers of il-17 + cells in the olp lesions ( figure 3(a ) ) . 
 however , in reticular olp subgroup , there was a positive correlation between the il-23p19 staining scores and the numbers of il-17 + cells ( figure 3(c ) ) , whereas no correlation was found in erosive olp group ( figure 3(b ) ) . 
 moreover , we also found that the mrna expressions of both il-23 subunits , il-23p19 ( figure 3(d ) ) and il-12p40 ( figure 3(e ) ) , are positively correlated with mrna expression of il-17 in reticular olp samples . 
 these results showed that overexpressions of il-23 and il-17 are positively correlated in the reticular olp lesion , indicating a potential regulatory role of il-23 to the expression of il-17 in the early stage of olp lesion . 
 next , we explored the potential role of il-23 in the production of il-17 in olp . 
 although il-17 has been recently reported to be produced by various cell types , a cd4+th cell subset , namely , th17 cell , is one of its main sources . on the other hand , in the local lesion of olp , 
 therefore , here we focused on the effect of il-23 to the il-17 production in cd4+th cells from 10 olp patients . 
 we observed that compared to the control group , the stimulation of ril-23 significantly increased the percentage of cd4+il-17 + cells ( identified as th17 ) in cd4+th cells from olp patients ( figures 4(a)4(c ) ) . 
 in addition , the il-17 content in the culture supernatant of cd4+th cells also increased under the stimulation of il-23 than the control group ( figure 4(d ) ) . 
 these data suggest that the overexpression of il-23 in olp lesions probably contributes to the induction of th17 and the production of il-17 . 
 we next explored the potential biological effects of il-17 , the essence effector of il-23/il-17 axis , in olp lesions . 
 it is well known that oral keratinocyte is an important component in the oral mucosa immunity and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory oral diseases , including olp , by producing various inflammatory mediators , such as cytokines , chemokines , and defensins . 
 therefore , we investigated the effect of il-17 on the expressions of inflammatory mediators by hok16e6e7 , a human oral keratinocyte cell line . 
 first we detected effect of il-17 on the mrna expression of human -defensins ( hbd ) in hok cells . 
 we observed that il-17 significantly increased mrna expressions of hbd-2 and -3 in a dose - dependent manner , but not hbd-1 ( figure 5(a ) ) . 
 we next detected the mrna expression of 6 chemokines and found that il-17 could significantly increase the mrna expressions of il-8 , ccl-20 , but not cxcl-9 , -10 , -11 or ccl-5 , in hok cells ( figure 5(b ) ) . 
 furthermore , we found that il-17 significantly increased mrna expressions of tnf- , an important proinflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of olp , in hok . 
 however , mrna expression of il-6 exhibited no significant difference with or without the effect of il-17 ( figure 5(c ) ) . 
 the data revealed that the il-17 could selectively regulate the expressions of some , but not all , inflammatory mediators in oral keratinocytes , indicating the selectively regulatory role of il-23/il-17 axis in the immune network in olp lesions . 
 in recent years , the il-23/il-17 axis has been widely described to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory disorders . 
 however , study about the expression and regulatory role of this new axis in olp is just at its beginning . in a recent study of our group 
 , we found no difference in the serum levels of il-23 and il-17 between the olp patients and controls . 
 the present study is focused on the expression and regulatory role of il-23/il-17 axis in the local environment of olp lesions . 
 il-23 is the upstream driving cytokine in the il-23/il-17 axis ; its importance in inflammation and autoimmunity has been widely demonstrated . to determine whether il-23 is involved in the development of olp 
 , we first detected its expression in the olp lesions compared with the nom tissues . 
 structurally , il-23 is composed of a unique p19 subunit and a common p40 subunit shared with il-12 . to avoid confusion 
 however , in the quantitative pcr assay , we examined the mrna expressions of both the il-23p19 and il-12p40 , for the expression of each gene could influence the amount of the il-23 . 
 our results revealed an upregulation of il-23p19 in both erosive and reticular olp lesions compared to the nom , indicating its involvement in the disease progress . as a driving factor of immune response 
 , il-23 is predominantly produced by the antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) including dentritic cells and macrophages , but its expression was also found in the keratinocytes from normal and psoriatic skin . 
 in addition , the epidermis in lesional psoriatic skin revealed markedly stronger il-23p19 stain than the epidermis in normal skin . 
 similarly , here we also observed a diffuse and strong expression pattern of il-23p19 in the epithelial layer of olp lesions , where keratinocytes are the major cell type . 
 these findings suggested that keratinocytes may be a major source of il-23 production under the chronic inflammatory condition in the mucocutaneous system . 
 although both the erosive and reticular olp lesions had significantly increased immunostaining scores of il-23p19 than the normal oral mucosa , the expressions of il-23p19 between the erosive and reticular olp lesions are similar . 
 this observation suggests that the overexpression of il-23 may be an early event in the pathogenesis of olp lesion and be maintained at a high level in the later progress . 
 il-17 is another key component in the il-23/il-17 axis and primarily functions as a downstream effector . 
 overexpressions of il-17 have been observed in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases , and its pivotal roles in the pathogenesis have been profoundly identified [ 20 , 35 ] . 
 although il-17 can be secreted by a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells , t cells are still its major sources , especially the new subset of cd4+th cells , namely , th17 . considering the involvement of 
 a t - cell - mediated immune response in the pathogenesis of olp , it is not surprising that il-17 and th17 cells may be present and play a regulatory role in the local environment of the disease . 
 indeed , we observed a large number of il-17 + cells located in the subepithelial lymphocytic infiltrate in the olp lesions . besides , our data showed increased numbers of il-17 + cells and higher mrna expressions of il-17 in the olp lesions compared to the nom tissues . 
 in addition , compared to the reticular olp lesions , erosive olp lesions contained much more il-17 + cells . 
 these findings are consistent with the recent published study by piccinni and his colleagues , who also found an elevated mrna expression of il-17 , together with other th17 type molecules in the olp lesions compared to the healthy mucosa . moreover , 
 the presence of th17 was also identified in another recent study conducted by xie et al . . 
 we must admit that the overexpression of il-17 in olp lesions is attributed partly to the infiltration of lymphocytes in the local environment . 
 however , the large amount of il-17 cytokine in the local lesions of olp can not be overlooked , for its potent proinflammatory properties may induce profound biological effects and play an important role in the formation and progress of the disease . 
 on the other hand , piccinni et al . also found that the cd4+t cell clones generated from olp lesions produced significant higher levels of il-17 than those generated from the healthy oral mucosa . 
 this phenomenon indicated that the overexpression of il-17 in olp lesions attributes not only to the lymphocytic infiltration , but also to other unknown regulatory mechanisms , which is needed to be further explored . 
 since il-23 is a major upstream inducer of il-17 production , it is reasonable to further explore whether the upregulation of il-23 has any regulatory role in the il-17 production in the local environment of olp . 
 based on the data , we conducted correlation analysis of the expressions of il-23 and il-17 . although no correlation between il-23p19 staining scores and il-17 + cell numbers was found in the total olp group or erosive olp subgroup , there were positive correlations between the expressions of il-23 and il-17 at both protein and mrna levels in reticular olp subgroup , indicating that the upregulation of il-23 is associated with increased levels of il-17 in the early stage of olp lesion . 
 on the other hand , the lacking of correlation between il-23 and il-17 expressions in erosive olp lesions may be due to the persistent high levels of il-23 but various levels of il-17 , indicating the existence of other potentially regulatory mechanisms , other than il-23 , in the il-17 expressions in the erosive stage of olp . according to the recent published data by xie et al . 
 , the il-17 in the olp lesion is mainly expressed in cd4+t cells , which is identified as th17 , in the subepithelial lymphocytic infiltration , as observations by double immunofluorescence staining . 
 in addition , cd4+t cell clones generated from olp lesions exhibited an elevated activity in the il-17 production . 
 thus , we investigated the effect of il-23 on the cd4+t cells from olp patients . 
 our results showed that the stimulation of il-23 could significantly increase the percentage of th17 and the il-17 production in cd4+t cells from olp patients . 
 recent immunological findings have supported the opinion that , although il-23 has no effect on the initiation of th17 differentiation , it is crucially required for the proliferation and stability of precommitted th17 cells , their further migration into the pathological tissues , and the production of il-17 , in which way to promote the pathogenic function of th17 cells [ 37 , 38 ] . based on these findings and our data in the present study , it can be suggested that the overexpression of il-23 may be functional and contributes , at least in part , to the accumulation of th17 cells and the increased level of il-17 in the olp lesion . 
 therefore , the il-23/il-17 axis may represent a new signaling pathway in the crosstalk between the keratinocytes and cd4+t cells , which may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of olp . to investigate the potential biological effects of il-23/il17 in the olp lesion 
 , we further explored the effects of il-17 , the major effector of il-23/il-17 axis , on the production of different inflammatory mediators by the oral keratinocytes . 
 accumulated studies have demonstrated that oral keratinocyte is one of the major sources of the aberrant expressions of various inflammatory mediators in olp lesions , including cytokines , chemokines , and defensins , which interact with each other and compose the complex immune network in the olp environment [ 712 , 3941 ] . however , the mechanism of the functional alterations in the keratinocyte from olp lesions is still unclear . 
 our results showed that the stimulation of il-17 could significantly increase the mrna expressions of hbd-2 , 3 , il-8 , ccl-20 , and tnf- , but not the expression of hbd-1 , cxcl-9 , -10 , -11 , ccl-5 , and il-6 in hok cells . 
 these data revealed that the effects of il-17 on the oral keratinocyte are selective but not extensive , suggesting a unique regulatory role of il-23/il-17 axis in the local environment of olp lesions . in summary , based on the findings in the present study , we propose a novel model of interaction between the t cells and keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of olp , in which the il-23/il-17 axis is involved ( figure 6 ) . 
 firstly , keratinocytes in olp lesion produce a large amount of il-23 via an unknown mechanism . 
 next , keratinocyte - derived il-23 may contribute to the accumulation of th17 cells and the overproduction of il-17 in the local lesion of olp . 
 subsequently , il-17 reversely induces the keratinocytes to selectively produce various inflammatory mediators , which compose the complex immune network in the inflammatory environment of olp lesions . 
 our results warrant further explorations on the intrinsic mechanisms of the overexpression and the regulatory effects of il-23/il-17 axis , as well as its interaction with other signaling pathways , in the olp lesions . 
 notably , il-23/il-17 axis has been recently considered as a relevant therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases , and several biological agents blocking il-23 or il-17 have been currently developed [ 22 , 42 ] . 
 therefore , further understanding of the role of il-23/il-17 axis in the pathogenesis may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and management of olp in the future .","interleukin- ( il- ) 23/il-17 axis is a newly discovered proinflammatory signaling pathway and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory and immune disorders . 
 here we investigated whether the il-23/il-17 axis was present and functional in the lesions of oral lichen planus ( olp ) , a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the oral mucosa . using immunohistochemistry and quantitative pcr , we found that the subunits of il-23 and il-17 were overexpressed in olp lesions than in normal oral mucosa tissues . 
 in addition , the expressions of il-23 and il-17 are positively correlated in reticular olp tissues . 
 results from in vitro studies revealed that exogenous il-23 could increase the percentage of th17 cells and il-17 production in the cd4+t cells from reticular olp patients . 
 furthermore , we also found that exogenous il-17 could significantly enhance the mrna expressions of -defensin-2 , -3 , ccl-20 , il-8 , and tnf- , but not -defensin-1 , cxcl-9 , -10 , -11 , ccl-5 , and il-6 in human oral keratinocytes . taken together 
 , our results revealed an overexpression pattern and selectively regulatory roles of il-23/il-17 axis in the olp lesions , suggesting that it may be a pivotal regulatory pathway in the complex immune network of olp lesions .",pubmed
"as has been the case in most other industries , the promise of new technologies and innovations has been cited as the way to address the healthcare industry s current challenges ; in particular , to circumvent the so - called  iron triangle 
 , simultaneously improving access , cost , and quality of care . at the same time , research based institutions across the globe are experiencing significant stress from more competition for less funding . from fy 2003 to 2015 , for example , the nih lost 22% of its capacity to fund research due to budget cuts , sequestration , and inflationary losses . 
 this resulted in fewer grants and discoveries , along with talented scientists and investigators leaving research and/or the us . 
 as such , it is more important than ever to increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which investments in fundamental research and development translate into products , services , and procedures that improve the health and wellbeing of people around the world . 
 examples abound of the power of technology and innovation to enable disruptive step changes in performance while simultaneously slashing costs . 
 moore s law in semiconductors , which projects a doubling of cpu capacity every 18 to 24 months , typifies the exponential power of technology . 
 innovator and futurist ray kurzweil extended moore s law to show that when a specific technology platform approaches some kind of physical limit , a new one emerges to extend the exponential growth , bypassing perceived barriers . 
 eroom s law typifies the experience in the pharma industry : rather than show an improvement , the trend for new drug approvals by the us food and drug administration per inflation - adjusted us dollars spent on r&d is a decrease of 50% over 9 years  a negative rather than positive exponential growth . while no generally accepted 
 law  exists for healthcare as a whole , labor productivity in healthcare , for example , is in decline , with technology not improving productivity as it has in other industries . 
 successful innovation in healthcare requires navigating a long and challenging journey between an unmet need or discovery generated from basic research to a viable commercial product or service . 
 while there are many potential stumbling points along the way , the so - called valley of death that exists between academic research and commercialization of a new product is often cited as a key obstacle for health innovations . 
 the valley of death has been shown to occur most frequently in the presence of non - economic investments , such as government expenditures on early stage , basic research without attention to the likelihood of commercially motivated investment at later stages if successful . 
 technologies that emerge from academia which do not have a promising commercialization pathway and clearly articulated value proposition are simply not considered by financially - motivated investors and , as a result , languish in the lab . 
 financial investors are not typically impressed with the great technical results that investigators focus on developing and are rewarded for publishing  they expect them . 
 they understand the reality is that the vast majority of new ventures fail not because of flawed science (  technical risk  ) , but because the market does not perceive a need or will not pay for the product or service (  market risk  ) . 
 many academic investigators and research teams are simply not prepared or motivated to think beyond their work in the lab to anticipate or address commercial issues such as market risk . 
 some are even discouraged from considering commercial issues while conducting research due to lingering concerns about aligning too closely with industry . 
 a commonly held misconception by many investigators is that once they are successful publishing results in a high impact journal , the commercial value will be so self - evident that companies will flock to get commercial rights . as a result , many leave commercialization related issues to be addressed only after a technology is shown to work ( i.e. proof - of - concept demonstrated ) , expecting them to be  transferred  to a company that will bring a product or service into practice . as a result , academic innovators pursuing translational research still often approach it with the mindset of doing science . 
 they do not develop an appreciation for which of the many paths available to them is most likely to lead to patient impact and hence financial return for investors . today 
 s challenging funding situation , with historically low pay - lines , creates even more pressure for investigators , particularly new ones , to focus on novelty and quickly move on to new areas once publishable results have been generated . 
 this often leaves institutional technology transfer offices ( ttos ) with the very challenging task of seeking licensees to technologies that have been shown to work , but with no clear commercial value and without much , if any , technical support . 
 simultaneously , financially driven investors are becoming less willing to take risks , particularly risks that they can not control or may only pay - off in the longer term . 
 they are looking to invest in opportunities for which they are well positioned to manage the risks , such as implementation related issues . 
 they do not want to take risks in areas for which they have no control , such as market acceptance , reimbursement and regulatory acceptance . as a result of these increasing pressures from both sides , 
 the only teams surviving the commercialization journey through today s more treacherous valley of death are ones with the most robust preparation , demonstrably de - risking both the technology and the market to succeed in attracting investors . 
 universities and academic medical centers are facing increasing competition to not only win scarcer research funding , but also to attract the best investigators and students . to compete successfully at both 
 , they need to do more in preparing and supporting those investigators interested in translating research into practice : excellence in science is still required , but is no longer sufficient . 
 investigators that wish to expand beyond basic research need new skills and resources that can help them focus on creating and developing technologies that have a better chance of surviving the commercialization journey long enough to engage investors and get products to the market . 
 one approach being taken at some institutions is to add a business development function to an institution s tto , expanding its role to include 
 while this approach can be very effective in advancing some projects , it does not address the fundamental issue of improving the commercial readiness or attractiveness of technologies emerging from labs . 
 in addition , balancing the roles of guardian and promoter of ip in a single cost center with increasingly constrained budgets can add an obstacle to commercialization which discourages all but the few that are selected for support . another approach taken by institutions , including stanford biodesign and the coulter foundation as well as by funders , including the nih and the nsf , are creating programs to assist academic investigators advance technologies toward commercialization while they are conducting their research . 
 they are providing educational opportunities to help investigators understand , anticipate and address commercialization challenges . 
 efforts range from didactic educational programs to accelerators which provide hands - on skills development and bridge / product development funding as well as support in the form of mentoring and  pitch 
 competitions , the goal being to help teams achieve a commercial exit : the point at which financially motivated investors such as angels , vcs and strategic players invest . 
 figure 1 schematically represents a range of these approaches taken by organizations to improve the effectiveness of the translational research they support . 
 figure 1.the gap filled by hcps in the portfolio approaches used by academic programs to improve the impact of translational research they support . the gap filled by hcps in the portfolio 
 the horizontal axis represents the typical focus of the effort . at one end of the spectrum 
 the focus is on building the skills of individuals , such as university based degree programs . 
 the other end of the spectrum is focused on helping advance projects , such as accelerator programs . 
 the vertical axis represents the typical intensity of the efforts . at one end of the spectrum 
 are activities that take a few hours and cost very little to deliver , such as webinars . at the other end 
 are programs that take years and cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars , such as university based degree programs . 
 an emerging option for academic investigators is the development of healthcare commercialization programs ( hcps ) . 
 these programs attempt to strike a balance by cost - effectively advancing a project into commercialization , while simultaneously building the skills of team members so that they can learn while contributing to an entrepreneurial activity . 
 two recent examples are a modified version of the i - corps program , adapted in collaboration with the nih   and another being the coulter foundation c3i program . in 2013 , 
 the national heart , lung and blood institute ( nhlbi ) took a fresh approach to improving the effectiveness of the translation of academic based research into implementation . 
 it established three centers to accelerate innovations from the bench to the clinic : the nih centers for accelerated innovations ( ncais ) . 
 the ncais are to help advance projects into patient care by providing product development funds and project facilitation , while also providing skills development to empower academic investigators with a greater understanding of the commercial path of their technologies . 
 the ncais were provided additional funds by the nsf in the spring and summer of 2015 to explore how the i - corps program could help advance ncai supported projects into practice . 
 the university of california ncai   applied its pre - existing i - corps program and approach for teams from across the university of california network , with a focus on teams from the san francisco area . 
 the boston ncai , b - bic   ( through its collaborator the consortia to improve medicine with innovation and technology : cimit ) and cleveland s ncai ( the nih center for accelerated innovation at cleveland clinic ; ncai - cc ) took a different approach . 
 they choose to blend several methodologies into a program intended to address the unique challenges facing healthcare innovations . 
 they each built on the fundamentals of the i - corps program while integrating commercialization experiences gained from introducing therapeutic and healthtech products . 
 cimit built on its 18 + year history and experiences facilitating more than 600 projects with its unique approach to facilitating teams as well as its work with the coulter foundation and academic based programs at its member institutions . 
 cleveland clinic incorporated specific workshops focused on therapeutics , including regulatory and intellectual property with support of the nhlbi staff . a brief overview of each and some results are outlined below : cimit s focus is on healthtech innovations , the overlap of medicine and engineering , including devices , diagnostics , e / digital health and big data . 
 its initial pilot program had eight weekly sessions and was comprised of a cohort of 9 teams . 
 each team had a clinical lead , technical lead and entrepreneurial lead , which were supported by an executive from the cimit accelerator team . 
 the overall results were very promising , with four teams successfully attracting commercial funding within 6 months of completing the course , receiving more than $ 11 m in commercial investment . 
 three are now pursuing licensing opportunities instead of trying to create a newco , and two projects are being rethought after learning of the lack of a market need . 
 programmatically , these  quick kills  are viewed as being a success along with the teams that are able to advance to commercialization as it saves time and resources so that teams can work on more impactful problems . the teams all reported significant progress in a compressed period of time , and similar results 
 an example of a self - reported team assessment is:our experience at the cimit program and all the support from the faculty has been instrumental to our progress . 
 less than a year ago , i was an md - phd student with no business experience and no intentions of commercializing technology . 
 in fact , before the course , we did nt even know who our customer was or what our product was , let alone our business model . 
 cimit taught us to make hypotheses about our business and test them rigorously by speaking to all the stakeholders in the ecosystem . 
 not only did we convince ourselves of who our customer was and what we should be building , all the data we gathered also convinced investors .   our experience at the cimit program and all the support from the faculty has been instrumental to our progress .

 not only did we convince ourselves of who our customer was and what we should be building , all the data we gathered also convinced investors .  the ncai - cc hcp program was seven weekly sessions , specifically designed for therapeutics . 
 it provided specialization workshops on regulatory and intellectual property consideration with nhlbi staff and focused on the development of a target product profile , an accepted tool for pharmaceutical development projects . 
 the cohort included five teams , each with a principal investigator , entrepreneurial lead and a faculty member , one of the ncai product development directors . 
 the teams all began at different baselines but advanced their understanding of their commercialization process . 
 they defined the types and quality of data that would be required to attract a pharmaceutical company s interest in commercial development . 
 one team identified a path that includes formation of a new company and application for sbir support . 
 examples of the self - reported assessments include:taught to think differently about our technology  with a business / practical perspective never learned in graduate school or as a postdochelped prepare me for industry 
 i became better suited to write business reports such as a strategic plan focused for upper managementit was not until we talked to clinicians , patients and regulatory experts that we were able to capture a holistic view of how our technology fit in the therapeutic ecosystem .

 the cimit and ncai - cc faculty coordinated activities in developing , delivering and critiquing their programs . despite the differences between the programs due to the different clinical foci , the faculty developed consensus 
 while there is strong agreement that there is no single  right way  to run an hcp , the following points are intended to help guide others wishing to develop an hcp . 
 the lessons reinforce the applicability of some of the fundamentals of the i - corps program as well as ways that an hcp should differ from i - corps to address the unique needs and challenges of healthcare innovators and innovations . 
 the fundamental premise of the i - corps program was found to apply very well to healthcare : get team members out of the lab to talk with stakeholders , customers in particular , and apply the scientific approach of developing , testing and validating hypotheses about the business . 
 there are many facets of the i - corps program that were found to apply ; some key examples include : 
 a weekly goal of around 10 exploratory interviews with a range of stakeholders needs to be stressed , and may be the most challenging as well as valuable thing for participants to learn . 
 most successful investigators are good advocates and teachers , re - learning to listen to feedback is often a challenge , particularly when based on partial information.the flipped - classroom structure with off - line assignments and weekly two - hour interactive session focused on practical applications of the materials and on teams presenting their work for robust feedback in a mix of physical and web - based meetings is time - efficient and allows participants to continue with their  day jobs.programs should run at least eight to ten weeks to allow time for a sufficient number of interviews along with the potential of at least one  pivot  - a change in direction based on validated feedback from the market . a weekly goal of around 10 exploratory interviews with a range of stakeholders

 it is not surprising that an effective hcp would differ from the i - corps program since it was developed with a different focus . 
 i - corps was designed to support principal investigator led academic teams with sbir awards in a broad range of industries . while many commercialization challenges transcend industries , there are some unique challenges facing healthcare innovators that require simultaneous attention in an hcp . 
 some key examples include : 
 1.buying dynamics : the user of the products / services ( user ) and those responsible for making a buying decision ( economic buyer ) in healthcare are usually not the same people , can be very hard to identify and may change from one institution to the next . in addition , users and economic buyers frequently have competing or misaligned objectives . 
 this is in contrast , for example , to selling to consumers who make the purchasing decision and use the products.2.reimbursement complexity : reimbursement for products / services in healthcare is a complex and highly regulated process . 
 this is in contrast to most industries in which the price a company can charge is established by a free market.3.regulatory pathway : while regulations exist in every industry , the impact that early and what may appear to be subtle decisions can have a major impact on the level of testing and validation that a medical product or service must undergo before being approved for sale or use 
 . the decision can mean the difference of years before introduction and 10 s of millions of dollars of investment and therefore commercial viability . 
 the option to start with a minimally viable product ( mvp ) and iterate with customer experiences to improve it is not the same as it is in industries with products that have less potential for harm , and are therefore less regulated.4.culture : healthcare professionals , be they doctors , nurses , therapists , technicians , etc . must invest many years and a great deal of money into education in order to practice . 
 the option for them to leave a position to focus on a start - up comes at a very high professional and personal risk and therefore is often not practical . 
 however , their constant engagement in a development effort and focus on addressing important unmet clinical needs is critical to success . 
 their engagement must be managed within their other time constraints , which are generally only increasing , and done in a way consistent with their expectations and culture.5.funding requirements : while there is a wide range of funding required to develop a new product across industries , healthcare innovations are typically at the higher cost end . 
 while the low - range may be $ 100k for an app and a few $ million for a consumer device , it now costs about $ 2 billion to bring a new drug to the market . in 2010 
 , medical devices typically cost between $ 31 million for those that require a 510(k ) and $ 94 million for higher - risk devices requiring the pma regulatory pathway ( excluding reimbursement and sales / marketing activities ) . as such , more resources , both quantity and magnitude 
 investors with smaller dollars are therefore less inclined to invest due to the potentially negative impact that later stage investments can have on the value of their investment .

 investors with smaller dollars are therefore less inclined to invest due to the potentially negative impact that later stage investments can have on the value of their investment . 
 below are some key distinguishing features and attributes the authors suggest to build on the i - corps fundamentals to address these healthcare specific issues in constructing and conducting an effective hcp : 
 1.team composition : teams need to include the perspectives and proactive engagement from the clinical as well as the technical and business environments . 
 while all team members need to share work and responsibilities , the person with the business / entrepreneurial focus needs to take the lead in coordinating the team s efforts as well as organize the outreach and implementation of stakeholder interviews . 
 clinicians are critical team members , and being time efficient is crucial to enable their participation . 
 this approach differs from i - corp that has fixed team member roles and only includes a technical and entrepreneurial lead along with an industry mentor supplied by the team . 
 successful implementation requires that each team member understands and is prepared to put in the time required , a total of about 40 hours / team / week . 
 senior faculty members should be discouraged from taking a team member slot if they intend to just oversee the work.2.executive faculty : given the inter - related complexities associated with healthcare innovations and need to balance multiple trade - off s simultaneously to effectively de - risk projects , the authors urge that the hcp faculty presenting materials be healthcare industry experts  and use healthcare examples . in particular , rather than having team - supplied mentors , the hcp should be responsible for supplying qualified , experienced industry veterans to provide teams with consistent feedback and guidance . to be cost effective , the same individuals can deliver most of the program s customized content as well as support teams . 
 it is important that in addition to the work they each do with a specific team that they work as group in providing regular synthesized feedback to teams . while increasing the cost , having experienced executives with a diversity of backgrounds ( technical , regulatory , operational , marketing , manufacturing , etc . ) 
 working together helps teams understand trade - offs and make better decisions to efficiently and cost effectively de - risk projects .

 team composition : teams need to include the perspectives and proactive engagement from the clinical as well as the technical and business environments . 
 while all team members need to share work and responsibilities , the person with the business / entrepreneurial focus needs to take the lead in coordinating the team s efforts as well as organize the outreach and implementation of stakeholder interviews . 
 clinicians are critical team members , and being time efficient is crucial to enable their participation . 
 this approach differs from i - corp that has fixed team member roles and only includes a technical and entrepreneurial lead along with an industry mentor supplied by the team . 
 successful implementation requires that each team member understands and is prepared to put in the time required , a total of about 40 hours / team / week . 
 senior faculty members should be discouraged from taking a team member slot if they intend to just oversee the work . 
 executive faculty : given the inter - related complexities associated with healthcare innovations and need to balance multiple trade - off s simultaneously to effectively de - risk projects , the authors urge that the hcp faculty presenting materials be healthcare industry experts  and use healthcare examples . 
 in particular , rather than having team - supplied mentors , the hcp should be responsible for supplying qualified , experienced industry veterans to provide teams with consistent feedback and guidance . to be cost effective , the same individuals can deliver most of the program s customized content as well as support teams . 
 it is important that in addition to the work they each do with a specific team that they work as group in providing regular synthesized feedback to teams . while increasing the cost , having experienced executives with a diversity of backgrounds ( technical , regulatory , operational , marketing , manufacturing , etc . ) 
 working together helps teams understand trade - offs and make better decisions to efficiently and cost effectively de - risk projects .

 hcps offer institutions and funders an additional option to improve the efficiency with which the healthcare projects they support reach practice and improve people s health . 
 it offers a cost effective way for them to increase the likelihood of selecting and advancing projects to commercialization and patient impact while also helping build innovation capacity . 
 they teach academic based investigators important skills in a learn - by - doing mode to enable them to contribute to entrepreneurial activities without attempting to turn them into entrepreneurs . while no single approach for hcps is being advocated , the lessons learned synthesized from a diversity of programs can act as a guide for those interested in establishing a hcp to maximize the impact of their available resources .","academic investigators are generating a plethora of insights and technologies that have the potential to significantly improve patient care . however , to address the imperative to improve the quality , cost and access to care with ever more constrained funding , the efficiency and the consistency with which they are translated into cost effective products and/or services need to improve . 
 healthcare commercialization programs ( hcps ) are described and proposed as an option that institutions can add to their portfolio to improve translational research . in helping teams 
 translate specific healthcare innovations into practice , hcps expand the skillset of investigators and enhance an institution s innovation capacity . 
 lessons learned are shared from configuring and delivering hcps , which build on the fundamentals of the national science foundation s innovation corps program , to address the unique challenges in supporting healthcare innovations and innovators .",pubmed
"bladder cancer is the second most common cancer in the urogenital tract . in about 85% of cases at the time of diagnosis of cancer 
 is limited only to the urinary bladder in the remaining 15% of the observed expansion beyond the urinary bladder . 
 the first confirmed carcinogenic factors were the aromatic amines : o - toluidine , 2-naftylamine , 4-aminobiphenyl , and many other chemicals contained in tobacco smoke . in recent years 
 currently there are about 1.1 billion smokers . in poland , there are about 9.5 million people smoking , including 43% of men and 22% of omen . 
 passive smoking is also becoming a widespread social phenomenon , mainly at home ( 47% men & 52% women ) and work ( 55% men & 27% women ) . in poland 
 , smoking is considered a shameful habit so patients asked about their smoking history do not readily admit to active smoking or they say they quit smoking just before evaluation . 
 most patients know that smoking is harmful since they are ashamed to admit to active smoking ( embarrassed for their ignorance ) 
 . they do not realize that it is possible to assess the reliability of the collected information about the history of smoking . 
 we do not consider smoking danger warnings placed on cigarette packs and media - advocated smoking cessation as helpful to the no - smoking cause . 
 the international agency for research on cancer predicts that by 2020 the number of deaths related to smoking will rise to 10 million per year , of which 70% will be in developing countries . at present approximately 20% of cancer deaths 
 it is , however , satisfying that recently administrative rulings managed to limit the number of public places where smoking is permitted . 
 research was carried out , which allegedly confirmed the positive results of this reduced smoking . 
 the aim of this study was to assess the reliability of a subjects smoking history , and assess compliance with the recommendations of smoking cessation on the basis of a questionnaire and the measurement of cotinine , a marker of exposure . 
 the study is a part of the long - term study conducted in our department funded by the national research committee , grant no . 
 the evaluation of patients treated in the department of general , oncologic and pediatric urology of collegium medicum nicolaus copernicus university in bydgoszcz in the period from june 2009 to december 2010 who had confirmed primary or recurrent bladder cancer by histopathological examination was undertaken . 
 every patient who agreed to participate in the study signed an informed consent form and completed a questionnaire on smoking history and tobacco smoke exposure . 
 it was asked whether the patient smokes , if so , how many cigarettes per a day and for how many years . 
 smokers were asked when they stopped smoking , how many cigarettes were smoked per day , and for how long . 
 a model questionnaire on the history of smoking : 
 1 . 
 non - smoker and non - exposed to the tobacco smokenever smokedstopped smoking  < 1 year ago2 - 5 years ago>5 years ago 
 2 . 
 smokersthe number of cigarettes smoked , packages ( 1 pack = 20 pieces)since i smoke ? 
 3 . 
 exposed to tobacco smoke  ' passive smokingplace of exposure to tobacco smokehomeworkanother placethe residence time in tobacco smoke ( hours)number of smokers 1 . 
 exposed to tobacco smoke  ' passive smoking each patient had their urine cotinine levels determined immediately after admission to the hospital to reduce the number of false - negative results arising from the discontinuation of smoking during hospitalization . 
 cotinine ( name of the synthetic ( s)-1- methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pirolydyna ) is an objective indicator of exposure to tobacco smoke and is found in the urine , even several hours after smoking ; with a half - life of 20 - 40 hours . in the body , it can be detected at very low concentrations in the limit 0.57 nmol / l = 0.1 ng / ml ( 6 ) . 
 the analysis of cotinine , the main metabolite of nicotine , were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc / dad ) . 
 application to the markings cotinine hplc / dad allowed the side to ensure adequate sensitivity of determination ( ng / l ) also identify the compound , determined by analysis of mass spectra . downloaded from those covered in the study sample of urine ( about 50 ml ) for analysis 
 were stored at minus 20 c. cotinine extraction from urine was carried out in alkaline ( ph = 11.1 mol naoh ) . 
 after evaporation of organic solvent in a nitrogen atmosphere the dry residue was dissolved in methanol and analyzed by hplc / dad with the following conditions : liquid chromatograph f - my agilent technologies ( binary pump & autosampler ) column eclipse xdb c8 zorba ( 150x4 , 6 mm , 5 l ) at 25 c , injection volume 20 ml . 
 the mobile phase was methanol / ammonium buffer ph = 3.5 with a flow of 0.8 ml / min . 
 detection of cotinine level in urine was performed in 96 patients , of which 35 patients ( 36% ) obtained results indicating active smoking ( cotinine levels in the urine of > 200 ng / ml , values range from 257 to 7929 ng / ml ) and in 4 patients ( 4% ) had cotinine levels equivalent to  passive smoking 
 ( level between 0 - 200 ng / ml , range of values from 40 to 187 ng / ml ) while in the remaining 57 patients ( 59% ) had no cotinine in urine ( table 1 ) . 
 subjects groups on basis cotinine level we analyzed the questionnaire completed by patients and compared it with test results of cotinine in the urine . among the 96 patients,18 admitted to smoking ( at about 19% ) , 
 in fact , in 35 ( 36% ) patients were confirmed by cotinine levels indicating active smoking , in 4 patients , exposure to tobacco smoke at home . among smokers , 
 the average smoking time is approximately 33 years ( range from 20 to 45 years ) . 
 the number of cigarettes smoked was on average 15.6 pieces per day ( range of values from 15 to 20 pieces a day ) within 18 months of observation in 3 patients in the first test was confirmed in the urine cotinine ( values from 2709 to 4760 ng/ ml ) in a subsequent study found no cotinine in 2 patients , with a group of non - smokers in another examination confirmed that indicates the level of active smoking ( values from 839 to 1110 ng/ ml ) was not confirmed in the questionnaire . 
 it is widely know from numerous publications that bladder cancer and smoking are strongly linked ; however , no significant correlation between the type of tobacco smoking , nicotine content of the smoked cigarettes , and higher risk of bladder cancer was confirmed . 
 all cigarette smoking , both  strong  ( with a higher nicotine content ) and  weak  ( with reduced nicotine content ) , with or without a filter , has the same negative effect on our body without clinically important differences . 
 there are no further reports assessing how smoking affects the course of bladder cancer , the number of recurrences , and the progression of the disease . 
 no such analysis is probably due to the limited reliability of the smoking questionnaire and due to expensive and time - consuming methods of monitoring cotinine in urine in all patients , which can only be afforded by a few university centers . 
 the destructiveness of tobacco should always be presented to all smoking patients in an attempt to persuade the smokers to stop smoking . 
 this study found that not all patients admit to smoking , and not all follow the recommendations to quit smoking . in the present study patients did not know that the information contained in it would be verified objectively before filling in the questionnaire . 
 therefore , 18% of patients admitted to active smoking and 4% of patients were unaware of the adverse effects of tobacco smoke exposure . 
 three smoking patients quit smoking by the 18-month follow - up while two from the group of non - smokers had confirmed active smoking in subsequent examinations , although the questionnaire strongly denied that those patients smoke . using a marker of exposure to tobacco smoke 
 each patient was determined in urine cotinine levels immediately after admission to hospital to reduce the number of false - negative results resulting from smoking cessation during hospitalization , despite the fact that the period of persistence of cotinine in the urine is so long that it enables detection , even after several hours . 
 detection of cotinine in urine proved to be a convenient and easy way that was acceptable to the patient and chosen by the authors of the study to eliminate the stress factor associated with the collection of a blood sample . 
 application to the markings cotinine hplc / dad allows side to ensure adequate sensitivity of determination ( ng / l ) also denoted the identification of compound . 
 statement and determine the levels of cotinine in the urine of patients who do not smoke tobacco will allow the realization of risks arising from the presence in tobacco smoke to those who reside there but involuntarily and unknowingly risk individuals [ 11 , 12 ] . in our study , people exposed to tobacco smoke ,  passive smoking  was not aware that being in smoky areas are directly exposed to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke . 
 satisfactory is the fact that in recent years through administrative rulings have managed to limit the number of public places where smoking is permitted . 
 still , smoking in enclosed areas , especially in households causes harmful substances that remain after combustion of nicotine on the surfaces of various objects for many hours and adversely affect people who are in such areas , in particular , children . on the question how smoking affects of bladder cancer evaluation 
 will answer the study conducted in our clinic during the long observation of patients with bladder cancer . 
 detection of cotinine level allows for credible assessment of medical history related to tobacco smoking.questions and answers indicated that the credibility of the questionnaire is limited to the disclosure and does not accurately relate smoking by the patients.assessment of active and passive smoking should be carried out based on evaluation of the questionnaire and measurement of the nicotine metabolite in the urine.monitoring of cotinine level allows for an objective assessment and to effectively convey the recommendations for quitting tobacco smoking .

"diabetes can cause acute and long - term complications , and is as well , a global risk factor for cardiovascular disease.1 lifestyle and behavior , as well as individual genetic predisposition , influence the risk of diabetes and prevalence in a community.2 public knowledge is the basis for lifestyle and behavior in a given community.3 therefore , the knowledge particular to diabetes is a key determinant of the lifestyle of a community , and can discriminate those who are at risk from those who are free of risk . 
 diabetes is increasingly prevalent in ethnic minority groups globally.2,4,5 recently , lorga et al6 reported that 16.7% of the karen rural community had an abnormally high blood glucose level ( > 100 mg / dl ) , and that there was a considerable proportion of prediabetic persons ( 13.04% ) in a cross - sectional survey among the karen minority . 
 the karen ethnic rural community along the thai  myanmar border is a hard - to - reach population for health promotion services . 
 karen people use their native language and most of the senior adult population in the community can not read thai script . 
 moreover , in a district like thasongyang , the population pattern is very dynamic and unstable because of a large migration across the border.7 karen people are indigenous to , and tend to stay along the thai - myanmar border such as area around tak province . 
 there is limited literature to guide the assessment of health literacy and knowledge of diabetes in such a community.8 the objective of the study was to assess the knowledge of diabetes of the rural karen residents , and compare the diabetes knowledge between male and female respondents . 
 this study was approved by the ethical board of the boromrajonani college of nursing nakhon lampang , lampang , thailand , and conducted with the verbal informed consent of participants . 
 it was conducted in thasongyang , which is a district in the far northwest of thailand , by the narrow moei river on the border of myanmar . 
 all participants were thai citizens but most of the participants could not read thai script . none had any prior known diagnosis of diabetes . 
 diabetes knowledge was assessed by a questionnaire that was developed by consensus between native researchers and researchers from the boromrajonani college of nursing nakhon lampang . 
 the questionnaires were delivered in the karen language by researchers speaking both thai and the karen language , and were completed by the interviewers . 
 fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) measurement was preceded by overnight fasting for 8 hours before the test . 
 body weight and height were measured by the public health officers using a standard measuring scale . 
 body mass index was calculated by the ratio of body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters . 
 continuous variables were summarized as median , maximum , and minimum values , as the distribution was not normal . the nonparametric test for trend analysis 
 was run by  nptrend  in stata version 11 ( stata corp , college station , tx ) .  yes ,   no ,  and  not sure  answers in the questionnaires were recoded as categories in order to compare by rank sum test . 
 a correct answer was coded to be 1 , and an incorrect answer , or the answer of  not sure ,  was coded as zero . 
 statistical significance was defined as p value less than 0.05 , with a 95% confidence interval .

 we assessed the diabetes knowledge briefly in three parts ( 1 ) general knowledge , ( 2 ) knowledge about the risk factors , and ( 3 ) knowledge about the symptoms , diagnostic signs , and complications of diabetes mellitus . 
 one - third of the population answered correctly ( range 27.09%41.81% ) , and another one - third gave no answer to these questions ( range 33.44%39.80% ) , whereas another one 
 third gave a wrong answer . among the karen community , 36.45% knew that old age is a risk factor for diabetes , 37.12% knew that they had diabetic relatives , 39.80% knew that obesity can lead to diabetes , 37.12% answered that exercise can prevent diabetes , 25.09% reported that pregnant women can have diabetes , and 41.81% said they should not eat excess fatty food for fear of diabetes . regarding the symptoms , diagnosis and complications of diabetes , less than 30% knew that fasting blood glucose level should be less than 100 mg% . 
 a few of the rural karen ethnic residents could correctly answer questions in the third part of the questionnaire . among the respondents , 33.78% answered that diabetic patients could have thirst and polyuria , 34.78% knew that numbness of the limbs might link to diabetes , 35.12% recognized the importance of foot care in people living with diabetes , 32.78% answered that untreated diabetes could lead to blindness , and 34.78% knew that slow wound healing might be due to diabetes . 
 overall , one - third of the sample population gave the correct answers ( range 32.78%34.78% ) while the other two - thirds were either unsure or gave wrong answers . 
 overall , public knowledge of diabetes among karen ethnic rural community is at the lower extreme ( figure 1 ) . 
 diabetes knowledge was compared between male and female by median sum of the knowledge scores . 
 overall knowledge level in female participants was also lower than in male participants ( figure 2 ) . 
 the median sum of the knowledge scores was 6 ( interquartile range : 211 ) among males , and 3 ( interquartile range : 18 ) among the females ( p for trend = 0.009 ) . there was a significant difference in level of knowledge among females and males .

 the number of diabetes cases is rising worldwide , and the burden of this is more severe in low- and middle - income countries.9,10  belonging to an ethnic minority  has been reported as a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes.2 disadvantaged people in these groups are more prone to the consequences of a silent epidemic.11 it is important to assess the public knowledge of diabetes , especially in minority ethnic populations . today , rising public health education and reduced disparity between groups are compulsory for the prevention and care of diabetes in all settings.12 risk perception of a community is the basis for healthy behavioral changes within a community.13 perception of risk among people at risk can prevent the disease 
 thus , we assessed the perception of diabetes risk factors among the karen ethnic rural community . 
 we found only one - third of the study sample had knowledge about diabetes risk factors ( table 2 ) . 
 most in the karen community did not know that elderly age , being overweight , and physical inactivity are risk factors for diabetes . 
 initiation of measures to educate this minority population , including use of mass media , and printed materials in the local language , might be a useful strategy for risk communication . 
 knowledge of diabetes symptoms is important for early diagnosis and accessing care . recognizing the symptoms of diabetes and its complications may bring the diabetic individuals to seek health care service . 
 symptoms of diabetes complications are common presentations , even though these might be indicators of late diagnosis , or poor glycemic control . 
 individuals lacking knowledge of these may not seek medical care in time , and consequently will have complications of diabetes.14 we assessed such knowledge in karen ethnic community ( table 2 ) . 
 the histogram of knowledge scoring was skewed to the left and peaked at lower end of the scoring ( figure 1 ) . 
 in contrast , the similar histogram for public knowledge of diabetes in singapore , was reported as totally skewed to the right side.15 the knowledge distribution among the karen ethnic sample was at the lower end , and pointed out a need for intervention . 
 in fact , diabetes and its consequent cardiovascular disease risk are higher in women.7 there is also increasing concern about gestational diabetes;16 however , our observations pointed out that diabetes knowledge among female karen participants was lower than among males . 
 this type of health inequality has also been reported in many other diseases.17 type 2 diabetes is more common in disadvantaged groups of women , such as those with least income and who are least educated.18 risk behaviors for type 2 diabetes have been highly prevalent even in the developed setting;19 moreover , poor women in the developing world tend to delay seeking care until symptoms are too severe.17 in the particular setting of this study , it is likely that women usually work in the home at housekeeping , and become housebound and sedentary . 
 a television education program in the local language might reach these women.19 lack of diabetes knowledge can cause missed diagnosis , late diagnosis , and higher incidence of diabetes complications . 
 creation of a peer - group gathering place for women , such as a health education club for mothers , and exercise club for housewives , may promote women s knowledge of diabetes and sharing of information . 
 in contrast to the current study findings , in a previous study , the public knowledge among thai people was reported to be fairly high and there was no gender gap between thai men and women.20 it is obvious that diabetes health education is poor among the karen ethnic community . 
 this might be due to a language barrier , which is a major obstacle to educating minority groups , as in other parts of asia.21 existing evidence suggests that such a situation calls for a culturally tailored and well - designed health education strategy.22 
 as this was a pilot study swiftly conducted to provide important information , there were weaknesses in the current study . 
 the questionnaire used in this study was made easily comprehensible for rural karen residents , and study findings may not be generalizable to other settings . albeit , the findings are the first of their kind to our knowledge , and are meant to assist in guiding further studies . 
 despite these limitations , this investigation contributed to our understanding of the health disparity in an ethnic minority population . 
 it provided insights into the need for health education interventions for the prevention of diabetes in a rural ethnic community . 
 the result of this study showed that karen ethnic men and women were less knowledgeable about all aspects of diabetes . 
 public education about diabetes in this setting should be started urgently and carefully , to overcome language and cultural barriers and prevent diabetes epidemic among these rural people . 
 our study finding is expected to be a step forward , in minimizing the disparity in diabetes health education .","background and purposethe public knowledge of diabetes is important for prevention of disease . this study aimed to evaluate knowledge of diabetes , risk factors , and the common warning signs of diabetes and complications among community participants in a rural karen ethnic community.methodsparticipants 
 were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding their knowledge of diabetes . 
 fasting blood glucose testing , blood pressure measurement , and body mass index ( bmi ) assessment were provided to the participants . 
 the study was conducted at thasongyang district , tak province , thailand.resultsa total of 299 karen rural residents were included in the study . 
 the median age was 45 years and median fasting blood glucose was 88 mg / dl . 
 the response rate to the questionnaires was 91.97% . 
 half of the participants knew diabetes is a noncommunicable disease needing lifelong treatment . 
 overall , one - third of the community participants could correctly answer the knowledge assessment questions regarding risk factors and common features of diabetes . whereas the other two - thirds either gave a wrong answer or were  not sure  . 
 female participants had poorer diabetes knowledge than the males.conclusionthe public knowledge of diabetes , as represented by this sample of the karen ethic community , is alarmingly low . 
 there is significant gender difference in knowledge level . culturally tailored and gender - sensitive diabetes health education interventions are urgently needed in this minority ethnic community .",pubmed
"specific mirnas have been found to be expressed in cell type - specific manner , at specific developmental stages , and in disease states including cancer [ 1 , 2 ] . during the initiation and progression of cancer , mirnas 
 have been observed to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors [ 3 , 4 ] . 
 while some mirnas are overexpressed in cancers , the majority appear to be lost and often localize to fragile sites . 
 differences in the mirna expression profiles of normal compared to cancerous tissue of the endometrium , breast and ovary have been documented [ 611 ] . 
 mirnas can affect the expression of a large number of proteins , including those involved in pathways relevant to cancer , such as apoptosis , migration and metastatis . 
 thus , mirnas hold promise as biomarkers for several types of cancer [ 12 , 13 ] . 
 epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is a normal process that occurs during development in which individual cells or groups of cells become motile . 
 the same process is thought to be used by cancer cells during tumor progression to enable them to become more motile and thus more metastatic . 
 emt involves reprogramming of the cells by transcription factors such as zeb1 , sip1 ( zeb2 ) , twist , snail , and slug . 
 a hallmark of emt is loss of e - cadherin expression , loss of polarity , acquisition of mesenchymal markers , and increased motility [ 16 , 17 ] . 
 both zeb1 and the closely related zeb2 bind e - box like sequences in the e - cadherin promoter , recruit the corepressor ctbp and thereby repress e - cadherin . 
 zeb1 expression is confined to cells of mesenchymal origin , while normal epithelial cells and low grade carcinomas do not express zeb1 . 
 however , we and others have shown that in high grade , aggressive carcinomas that have undergone emt , zeb1 can be expressed , leading to loss of e - cadherin [ 1922 ] . 
 several mirnas have been implicated in the process of emt , among them are the members mir-200 family [ 2325 ] . 
 this family contains five members ( mir-200a , -200b , -200c , -141 and , -429 ) which are highly homologous . 
 originally , mir-200c was reported to directly bind zeb1 and cause degradation of the mrna , resulting in an upregulation of e - cadherin . 
 subsequently , other reports have shown that all members of the mir-200 family , since they share a high degree of homology especially in their seed sequence , are capable of repressing both zeb1 and zeb2 [ 2729 ] . 
 we have demonstrated that mir-200c represses not only zeb1/2 , but a program of transcripts normally expressed only in cells of mesenchymal origin . since members of the mir-200 family are responsible for repressing zeb1 and zeb2 as well as other mesenchymal genes , these mirnas are considered 
 mir-200 family members are therefore thought to be expressed in an epithelial cell - specific manner in normal tissues . 
 recently , the ability of zeb1 to transcriptionally repress expression of mir-200 family members has been documented [ 31 , 32 ] . 
 this double negative feedback loop between mir-200 family members and zeb1 allows for plasticity between the epithelial and mesenchymal states . in this paper , we focus on the role of mir-200c in breast , ovarian , and endometrial cancers . 
 the mutual repression between zeb1 and mir-200c is functional in some , but not all cells that we have tested . 
 we demonstrate that the decrease in migration and invasion observed when mir-200c is reintroduced to cancer cells that lack it is independent of restoration of e - cadherin . 
 lastly , we have previously demonstrated that class iii beta tubulin ( tubb3 ) is directly controlled by mir-200c . 
 expression of tubb3 is known to be a common mechanism of resistance to microtubule - targeting agents in many types of cancer . here , 
 we present conclusive data that repression of tubb3 is the mechanism whereby mir-200c restores sensitivity to paclitaxel . taken together , these data demonstrate that loss of mir-200c is a marker for chemoresistance and aggressiveness in breast , ovarian , and endometrial cancers . 
 hec50 cells , representing the more aggressive type ii endometrial cancers , were cultured in dmem with 10% fbs , and 2  mm l - glutamine . 
 mda - mb-231 are a triple negative breast cancer cell line and were grown in media containing 5% fbs , hepes , nonessential amino acids , l - glutamine , penicillin , streptomycin , and insulin . 
 the identity of all the cell lines was confirmed by dna profiling using the identifiler kit ( applied biosystems ) . 
 lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen ) was combined with pre-200c ( mirna mimic ) or scrambled negative control ( ambion ) at a concentration of 60  nm and incubated in serum free rpmi for 20 minutes prior to addition to hey cells . 
 cells were incubated at 37c for 4 hours before replacement of fbs to 10% . protein and rna were harvested 48 hours posttransfection . 
 tubb3 ( from fernando cabral , university of texas - houston medical school ) was cloned into pci - neo . 
 transient transfection of 3.3  g of tubb3 plasmid or empty vector ( pci - neo , promega ) per well in a 6-well plate was performed using lipofectamine 2000 . 
 transduction of cells was performed using smartvectortm shrna lentivral particles ( thermo scientific dharmacon ) . 
 each cell line was transduced with 3 separate lentiviral constructs targeting zeb1 as well as two controls : smartvector empty vector particles and smartvector firefly luciferase control particles . 
 the former is a negative control and does not correlate with gene silencing and the latter is a positive control targeting firefly luciferase plasmids pgl2 and pgl3 . 
 all vectors are packaged and contain a turbogfp and an scmv promoter , as well as a puromycin - resistance selectable marker . mda231 and 
 hec50 cells were plated at 3000  cells / well and 1500  cells / well , respectively , in triplicate using 96 well plates . 
 the following day , media was replaced with 80  l of fresh media containing 10  g / ml polybrene ( sigma ) .   the amount of viral particles / well was determined using the following calculation : ( moi      cn)/vt , where moi ( multiplicity of infection )   =   10  tu / cell , cn   =   number of cells / well , and vt   =   stock viral titer of 10  tu/l . 
 viral particles were added in a total volume of 20  l to each well .   the following day , 
 transduction media was removed and wells were rinsed with pbs and replaced with regular media . 
 once confluent , cells were trypsinized and replated in 48 well plates .   at this point 
 , antibiotic selection was initiated and cells were ultimately expanded and maintained using 1  g / ml of puromycin ( sigma ) . 
 whole cell protein extracts were denatured and 50  g separated on 8% sds page gels and transferred to pvdf membranes . 
 the membranes were blocked in 5% milk in tbs - t , and then probed overnight at 4c . 
 doug darling , university of kentucky , 1 : 1500 dilution ) , e - cadherin ( clone nch-38 from dako , 1  g / ml ) , tubb3 ( rabbit polyclonal prb-435p from covance , 1 : 5000 dilution ) , and -tubulin ( clone b-5 - 1 - 2 from sigma , 1 : 20000 dilution ) . 
 after incubation with appropriate hrp - conjugated secondary antibody , bands were detected using western lightning chemiluminescence reagent plus ( perkin elmer ) . 
 rna was harvested from cells using trizol ( invitrogen ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions . prior to generating cdna 
 , mrna was treated with dnase1 ( invitrogen ) for 15 minutes at room temperature . 
 rna was reverse transcribed into cdna in a reaction containing reaction buffer , dntps , rnase inhibitor ( applied biosystems ) , random hexamers , and 200  u of mulv - rt ( applied biosystems ) . 
 the reaction proceeded at 22c for 10 minutes , then at 37c for one hour . for normalization 
 , real time rt - pcr was performed on the cdna using eukaryotic 18s rrna endogenous control primers and fam - mgb probe ( applied biosystems ) . 
 taqman microrna reverse transcription kit was used to generate cdna for real time rt - pcr reaction in conjunction with a mir-200c specific primer and probe ( abi , assay i d 002300 ) . the reverse transcription primer for mir-200c is a hairpin primer which is specific for the mature mirna and will not bind to the precursor molecules . reported values are the means and standard errors of 3 biological replicates . 
 the relative mrna or mirna levels were calculated using the comparative ct method ( ct ) . 
 briefly , the cycle threshold ( ct ) values for the rrna were subtracted from ct values of the target gene to achieve the ct value . 
 the 2 was calculated for each sample and then each of the values was then divided by a control sample to achieve the relative mirna levels ( ct ) . 
 the assays were performed on mda - mb-231 stable empty vector or shzeb1 # 2 , or hey cells transiently transfected with the mir-200c mimic for 48 hours . 
 bd biocoat control insert chambers 24-well plate with 8 micron pore size and bd biocoat matrigel invasion chambers were used for migration and invasion assays , respectively . 
 after starvation , cells were removed from the plate and 50000 hey cells or 250000 mda - mb-231 cells were plated in 0.5  ml media with 0.5% fbs in the upper chamber . in the lower chamber 0.8  ml of 50% conditioned media plus 50% complete media containing an additional 10% fbs 
 hey cells were incubated for 24 hours and mda - mb-231 cells for 48 hours at 37c . migrating or invading cells on the lower surface of the membranes were stained with diff - quik stain ( fisher ) and counted manually using imagepro plus software ( mediacybernetics inc . ) . 
 adhesion assays were performed using innocyte ecm cell adhesion assays ( calbiochem ) for collagen iv , fibronectin , basement membrane complex and laminin . to each well 50000 cells 
 the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37c , and fluorescence was read with an excitation wavelength of 485  nm and an emission wavelength of 528  nm . 
 the relative fluorescent units were plotted , and the error bars represent standard error of the mean over four replicates . 
 hey cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 2000 cells per well . 
 twenty - four hours after plating , the cells were treated with 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5  nm paclitaxel ( sigma ) in triplicate . 
 the cells were incubated at 37c for 8 days before fixing and staining with crystal violet . 
 photos were taken of the plates and the images analyzed using imagej software ( nih ) . the average number of colonies and the average total area was plotted , with error bars representing the standard error of the mean over the three replicates . 
 hec50 cells were transfected with the mir-200c mimic as described previously for the hey cells . 
 twenty - four hours after transfection , cells were treated with 0 , 15 , 20 or 25  nm paclitaxel ( sigma ) . 
 twenty - four hours after treatment , the cell death elisa ( roche ) which recognizes mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasm of dying cells was performed as per manufacturer 's instructions . 
 cells were plated into 6-well plates ( 4000 hey cells / well and 6000 mda - mb-231 or hec50 cells / well ) . at time 
 points indicated , cells were trypsinized and counted using the vi - cell cell viability counter ( beckman coulter ) . 
 just as members of the mir-200 family can repress zeb1 by degradation of its transcript , zeb1 can repress expression of the mir-200 family members by binding to e - boxes within their promoter regions [ 31 , 32 ] ; see figure 1(a ) . directly increasing mir-200c levels in hey cells ( aggressive serous ovarian cell line ) by transfection of a mir-200c mimic ( pre-200c ) results in repression of zeb1 expression ( figure 1(b ) ) . 
 although zeb1 is a repressor of e - cadherin , we did not observe e - cadherin expression induced by the repression of zeb1 in these cells ( data not shown ) . 
 however there are several other mechanisms through which e - cadherin can be lost including methylation of the promoter [ 34 , 35 ] and chromosomal deletion [ 36 , 37 ] . 
 in contrast , we have previously shown that transient transfection of the mir-200c mimic into mda - mb-231 ( an aggressive triple negative breast cancer cell line ) and hec50 ( an aggressive type 1 endometrial cancer cell line ) causes a marked repression of zeb1 and a restoration of e - cadherin expression . presently , we stably transduced lentiviral shrnas targeting zeb1 into these two cell lines ( hec50 and mda - mb-231 ) . 
 while two of the shrnas did not decrease zeb1 protein , shrna # 2 caused an almost complete repression of zeb1 expression resulting in re - expression of e - cadherin in both cell lines ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . 
 intriguingly , while knock down of zeb1 in mda - mb-231 cells causes the expected increase in mir-200c levels ( indicative of the reciprocal regulation ) , no such increase is observed in hec50 cells . 
 this suggests that while reciprocal repression of mir-200c and zeb1 occurs in some cell lines , it does not occur in all . 
 it has been previously shown that the mir-200 family members cause a decrease in cell migration and invasion [ 27 , 29 , 30 ] . 
 we observe a decrease in migration and invasion in the mda - mb-231 cells in which zeb1 has been knocked down , resulting in an increase in mir-200c levels . in the mda - mb-231 cells there is 52% decrease in migration and a 50% decrease in invasion in the shzeb1 # 2 containing cells in which zeb1 is completely knocked down versus luciferase control ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . 
 we show here that the same holds true in the aggressive ovarian cancer hey cell line . 
 this cell line is highly migratory and invasive , and reintroduction of mir-200c to these cells results in an 83% decrease in migration and a 7986% decrease in invasion compared to negative controls ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . 
 however , it is interesting to note that the effect on migration and invasion caused by mir-200c is independent of the e - cadherin status of the cells , since unlike the mda - mb-231 cells , hey cells do not regain e - cadherin expression in response to decreased zeb1 levels . 
 while e - cadherin protein affects epithelial cell - cell contact , we also wished to determine if mir-200c affects adhesion to substrates as measured by fluorescent adhesion assays . 
 hey cells transiently transfected with the mir-200c mimic showed a small but statistically significant decrease in adhesion to basement membrane complex ( bmc ) and laminin ( figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) ) . 
 there is also a trend towards decreased adhesion to collagen iv ( figure 3(c ) ) ; however , this did not reach statistical significance . 
 no difference in adhesion to fibronectin was observed ( figure 3(d ) ) . since there was an affect on adhesion to bmc and laminin in ovarian cancer cells with high mir-200c levels , we performed the adhesion assay with the hec50 and mda - mb-231 cells in which zeb1 had been stably knocked down . 
 we again see a decrease in adhesion to bmc and laminin in the mda - mb-231 cells ; however , only the decrease in bmc binding is statistically significant ( figures 3(e ) and 3(f ) ) . 
 in contrast to the hey and mda - mb-231 cells , there was no decrease in adhesion to either substrate in the hec50 cells in which zeb1 is knocked down ( data not shown ) , but there is not a concomitant increase in mir-200c , as shown in figure 1(d ) . 
 we have previously demonstrated that mir-200c expression causes increased chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents such as paclitaxel . while the elisa cell death assay that we have used previously to demonstrate this property of mir-200c is a short - term assay , we confirm here , in a relatively long - term clonogenic assay , that there is increased sensitivity of hey cells to paclitaxel when transfected with pre-200c ( figure 4(a ) ) . 
 we observe a 4955% decrease in total area and a 6770% decrease in the number of colonies in the pre-200c treated cells versus the negative control with 5  nm paclitaxel treatment ( figures 4(b ) and 4(c ) ) . as the assay 
 is conducted over a relatively long period of time , the maximum dose of paclitaxel used is relatively small compared to what is used in the assays that look at acute toxicity ( i.e. , 24 hours ) . at doses of paclitaxel of 10  nm and higher , 
 we have previously implicated the ability of mir-200c to directly target tubb3   ( class iii beta tubulin ) as being the mechanism responsible for the increased chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents . 
 tubb3 is normally only expressed in neuronal cells ; however aberrant expression of tubb3 in several different types of cancers has been shown to cause resistance to paclitaxel [ 3843 ] . 
 to definitively test whether tubb3 is responsible for the mir-200c - mediated increase in chemosensitivity to paclitaxel , we transfected cells with a tubb3 construct lacking its 3 utr ( containing the mir-200c binding site ) which is therefore not able to be targeted by mir-200c . 
 transfection of this exogenous tubb3 construct does not affect the transfection of the mir-200c mimic , nor its ability to downregulate zeb1 and upregulate e - cadherin ( figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) ) in hec50 cells . 
 when the hec50 cells are transfected with an empty vector ( no exogenous tubb3 ) in addition to mir-200c mimic , there is a statistically significant increase in sensitivity to paclitaxel as measured in a cell death elisa ; see figure 5(c ) . 
 however , when the cells are transfected with the tubb3 expression vector lacking its 3 utr , the enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel is lost ; see figure 5(d ) . 
 therefore , expression of exogenous tubb3 lacking the mir-200c target site reverses the chemosensitivity to paclitaxel caused by increased mir-200c expression . 
 it can be argued that cells with increased proliferation would be more sensitive to microtubule poisons and that could be an alternative explanation for the observed chemosensitivity upon restoration of mir-200c . 
 we therefore performed proliferation assays in the three cell types and found decreased proliferation in all three ( figures 6(a ) , 6(b ) , and 6(c ) ) . since the decrease in proliferation 
 is observed in all three cell types , including the hec50s where there was no increase in mir-200c levels , it is likely that the effects on proliferation occur via zeb1 and not by mir-200c . 
 the fact that the increase in chemosensitivity is found in cells that are proliferating more slowly than the negative controls demonstrates that increased proliferation is not the mechanism behind the increase in chemosensitivity . 
 in this paper we build on our previous work to further characterize the role that loss of mir-200c plays in generating an aggressive cancer phenotype . 
 zeb1 is normally only expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin ; however , its aberrant expression is observed in cancers that have undergone emt . 
 zeb1 ( and the closely related zeb2 ) transcripts are targeted by mir-200c and the other mir-200 family members . 
 interaction of any of the mir-200 family members with the zeb transcripts results in degradation and inhibition of translation . 
 therefore the maintenance of mir-200c expression in normal epithelial cells serves to prevent zeb1 and zeb2 from being expressed . 
 since both zeb1 and zeb2 repress genes involved in polarity , repression of these proteins serves to maintain polarity , an important epithelial cell characteristic . 
 we have recently shown that in addition to repressing zeb1 and 2 , mir-200c represses a program of transcripts normally only expressed in cells of mesenchymal and neuronal origin , such as fibronectin ( fn1 ) , neurotrophic tyrosine kinase ( ntrk2 ) , quaking 1 ( qki ) , and tubb3 . 
 thus , mir-200c maintains epithelial cell characteristics not only by maintaining polarity via repression of zeb1 and zeb2 , but also by repressing additional non - epithelial genes . 
 it has been recently demonstrated that mir-200c and zeb1 regulate each other in a double - negative feedback loop [ 31 , 32 ] . 
 the mir-200 family of mirnas is expressed in two clusters , one on choromosome 1p36.33 and the other on chromosome 12p12.31 . 
 therefore , in cells that have undergone emt , zeb1 and 2 not only serve to repress genes involved in polarity , but also repress the mir-200 family and thereby release the repression of many genes characteristic of the mesenchymal phenotype . 
 central to the double feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 is tgf-. during tgf-   -induced emt , there is an increase in ets1 which binds to and activates the promoter of zeb1 . 
 therefore , in a tumor microenvironment , increased tgf- levels are thought to result in an increase of zeb1 transcription to a point where it can overcome the repression caused by mir-200c . 
 as zeb1 protein begins to be made , it can then repress the mir-200 family members , resulting in progression through emt . 
 we have previously shown that restoration of mir-200c in hec50 endometrial cells and mda - mb-231 breast cancer cells causes repression of zeb1 and re - expression of e - cadherin protein . here 
 we show that transfection of mir-200c mimic into hey cells , an aggressive serous ovarian cell line , also causes a dramatic repression of zeb1 ; however no expression of e - cadherin was observed . to test whether the double - negative feedback loop is intact in the hec50 and mda - mb-231 cells , 
 these cells were infected with lentivirus expressing an shrna against zeb1 . in both cell lines , efficient knock down of zeb1 was achieved , as was re - expression of e - cadherin . in mda - mb-231 cells , zeb1 knock down resulted in an increase in mir-200c levels , as would be expected from the negative feedback loop . however , this was not the case in hec50 cells , where there was no increase in mir-200c . 
 whether the break in the negative feedback loop is an anomaly of this particular cell line remains to be tested . 
 the mechanism behind the phenomenon is also unknown ; however , it does offer an opportunity to dissect the contribution of zeb1 versus that of mir-200c to the phenotype of the cells . 
 for example , significantly decreased proliferation was observed in the hey cells transiently transfected with the mir-200c mimic as well as in the mda - mb-231 and hec50 cells that have zeb1 stably knocked down , although mir-200c levels did not rise in the hec50s . therefore it is likely that the decrease in proliferation is due to the lack of zeb1 , not an increase in mir-200c . 
 conversely , the decrease in adhesion to the basement membrane complex and laminin was only observed in the hey and mda - mb-231 cells , and not the hec50s , suggesting that this phenotype is a function of mir-200c expression rather than zeb1 . 
 we and others have previously shown that restoration of mir-200c to cancer cells that do not express it causes a decrease in invasion and migration [ 27 , 30 ] . here 
 we show that knock down of zeb1 in mda - mb-231 cells , which causes an increase in mir-200c , negatively affects migration and invasion . 
 furthermore , we show that restoration of mir-200c in hey ovarian cancer cells results in a dramatic decrease in migration and invasion even though e - cadherin is not restored in these cells , despite complete repression of zeb1 . 
 loss of e - cadherin expression can result from mechanisms other than zeb1 transcription repression , including chromosomal deletion and promoter hypermethylation [ 3437 ] . 
 possibilities for its continued absence in these cells include promoter methylation such that even when repression by zeb1 is relieved , e - cadherin will not be expressed , or perhaps levels of another transcriptional repressor such as snail or twist remain high and repress e - cadherin . 
 regardless of the mechanism , the effects of mir-200c on invasion and migration appear to be independent of e - cadherin status . 
 while e - cadherin is involved in epithelial cell - cell adhesion and its expression has been shown to negatively affect migration and invasion [ 45 , 46 ] , increased mir-200c is able to decrease migration and invasion on its own . 
 we have previously observed that restoration of mir-200c affects genes involved in cell motility and invasion such as arhgdib , ntrk2 , ephb1 , and fn1 . 
 we demonstrate that mir-200c causes a decrease in adhesion to basement membrane complex , laminin , and perhaps collagen type iv . 
 this observation is particularly relevant to ovarian cancer because the cancerous cells adhere to sites within the peritoneal cavity . during the progression of cancer 
 there is switching of the expression patterns of the cell surface adhesion molecules , such as the cadherins and integrins [ 4749 ] . 
 although the change in the number of adherent cells appears modest , this might play a significant role in developing a potential treatment for ovarian cancer . 
 the ability of ovarian cancer cells to spread and adhere to the peritoneal cavity is one of the major phenotypes of this disease . 
 a small change in ability of the cells to adhere might reflect a great decrease in the tumor burden and/or increase the ability to debulk the tumor . 
 these results are independent of e - cadherin expression since the decrease in adhesion is observed in both the mda - mb-231 cells ( where e - cadherin expression is regained with increased mir-200c ) and in hey cells , where it is not . 
 clonogenic assays reveal that there is an increase in chemosensitivity to paclitaxel with increased mir-200c levels . 
 indeed , acquired resistance to paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells has been shown to be associated with emt , resulting in an aggressive phenotype . clinically , 
 aberrant expression of tubb3 ( not normally expressed in epithelial cells ) has been found to be associated with resistance to taxanes [ 3841 ] . 
 we have previously shown that tubb3 is a direct target of mir-200c and suggested that its repression by mir-200c is the mechanism behind the ability of mir-200c to increase chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents . here , we perform the definitive experiment to prove that mir-200c - mediated tubb3 downregulation is indeed the cause of the enhanced chemosensitivity . 
 we utilized exogenous tubb3 lacking its 3utr such that it can not be targeted by mir-200c and show that resistance to paclitaxel is maintained even in the presence of mir-200c . 
 in contrast , endogenous tubb3 is reduced when mir-200c is added , resulting in enhanced chemosensitivity to paclitaxel . microtubule targeting agents such as paclitaxel work more efficiently in cells that are rapidly dividing . 
 consequently , it could be argued that the increase in chemosensitivity caused by mir-200c is due to increased proliferation . 
 however , we show that increase of mir-200c or direct knockdown of zeb1 results in decreased proliferation in three different types of cancer cells . 
 it is therefore the downregulation of tubb3 , not an increase in proliferation that is responsible for the enhanced chemosensitivity to taxanes observed with restoration of mir-200c to resistant cancer cells . 
 mir-200c expression serves to maintain the epithelial phenotype in well - differentiated , low - grade , breast , ovarian , and endometrial cancer cells . 
 furthermore we find that not all of mir-200c 's actions can be attributed to the restoration of e - cadherin via targeting of zeb1 . 
 we further prove that mir-200c - mediated repression of tubb3 is the cause of enhanced chemosensitivity to microtubule targeting agents . 
 lastly we demonstrate that not all cells exhibit the double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 and that this can be exploited to identify the distinct roles of mir-200c as compared to zeb1 .","we focus on unique roles of mir-200c in breast , ovarian , and endometrial cancers 
 . members of the mir-200 family target zeb1 , a transcription factor which represses e - cadherin and other genes involved in polarity . 
 we demonstrate that the double negative feedback loop between mir-200c and zeb1 is functional in some , but not all cell lines . 
 restoration of mir-200c to aggressive cancer cells causes a decrease in migration and invasion . 
 these effects are independent of e - cadherin status . 
 additionally , we observe that restoration of mir-200c to ovarian cancer cells causes a decrease in adhesion to laminin . 
 we have previously reported that reintroduction of mir-200c to aggressive cells that lack mir-200c expression restores sensitivity to paclitaxel . 
 we now prove that this ability is a result of direct targeting of class iii beta - tubulin ( tubb3 ) . 
 introduction of a tubb3 expression construct lacking the mir-200c target site into cells transfected with mir-200c mimic results in no change in sensitivity to paclitaxel . 
 lastly , we observe a decrease in proliferation in cells transfected with mir-200c mimic , and cells where zeb1 is knocked down stably , demonstrating that the ability of mir-200c to enhance sensitivity to paclitaxel is not due to an increased proliferation rate .",pubmed
